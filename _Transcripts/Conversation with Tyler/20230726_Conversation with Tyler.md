# Noam Dworman on Stand-Up Comedy and Staying Open-Minded  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [July 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBg1S_r7zoA)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm here with my very good friend, Noam Dwarman, in Comedy Cellar.
*  Noam is owner, impresario, and CEO of Comedy Cellar.
*  Three places in New York, one in Las Vegas, commonly considered America's leading comedy
*  club.
*  Noam, welcome.
*  Hello, Tyler.
*  Thank you very much for having me.
*  What is the perfect room temperature for comedy?
*  Ah, that's a great question.
*  The originator of the Comedy Cellar, named Bill Grundfest, this was a very important
*  issue for him.
*  He felt that if it got warm, this had a serious effect on how the comedians went over.
*  I think a little bit colder than comfortable is what is best.
*  70 maybe, something like that.
*  So it's like how stores often feel people buy more when it's cold?
*  The problem is that the kind of air conditioning systems that we have, you take what you can
*  get.
*  In a very, very hot day, they underperform, and then the thermostat says they're slow.
*  They don't keep things at a perfect temperature, so it hovers up and down around things.
*  But we try to keep it cool.
*  What's the biggest thing about audiences laughing at comedy that you do not understand?
*  Well, what's interesting is always that the entire audience, or most of the audience,
*  at the same instant in time, seems to react the same way, to know whether something is
*  funny in a way that nobody can explain.
*  This will happen even if it's the same comedian telling the same joke four days in a row.
*  I will find myself laughing harder at the same joke just as the entire room is laughing
*  harder.
*  But I could go to the video, and it's very difficult to pinpoint what he's doing differently.
*  But there's something on a micro level that they do differently, and everybody perceives
*  it the same way at the same time.
*  And that's the magic of it all.
*  I don't know if that's a direct answer to your question, but that's what it makes me
*  think of.
*  I don't know how to explain that.
*  There's something about human synchronization of the audience in there.
*  If you have to extrapolate that to broader social situations, what do you conclude?
*  People pick up on very slight cues, in an instinctual level, kind of analogous to pheromones,
*  I guess, that they can't account for.
*  They don't know they're doing it.
*  Probably affects who seems like a likable person and unlikable, who you trust.
*  There's a million different ways these things present themselves, but it's real.
*  It's very real.
*  And I would say some people are kind of oblivious to these clues, and they probably suffer for
*  that during their lives as well.
*  Circuit 2023.
*  Can comedy still shock us?
*  So simply using the F-word, trying to be like Lenny Bruce, it's all a big bore, right?
*  Is there shock value left in comedy?
*  Not funny shock value.
*  At some point, I've been expecting that somebody will channel Lenny Bruce and start defiantly
*  using the N-word again, or something like that, to make a deep point.
*  And at some point, may get away with it.
*  But no, usually things that are shocking now are trite and not that funny.
*  A reader suggests to me that people don't tell jokes very much anymore, but they watch
*  YouTube or TikTok for humor.
*  How does that affect comedians?
*  What that makes me think of is that at some point, comedians started referring to their
*  bits as jokes.
*  And that happened gradually.
*  And I remember waking up and realizing, well, that's not what a joke is.
*  A joke is a setup and a punchline.
*  A joke isn't one of your descriptions that is a funny thing.
*  And that's right.
*  The kind of setup punchline of joke is rare.
*  Old people do them sometimes.
*  But what's considered jokes today are comedy bits.
*  And people don't tell each other comedy bits.
*  So I think you're right.
*  Fewer and fewer people tell each other jokes.
*  Why you want jokes funny anymore?
*  I don't ever want to hear jokes.
*  If someone walked into the room, sat at the table, I'm going to tell you a joke.
*  I'd be like tune out or maybe this is anthropologically interesting.
*  But funny is the last thing I would expect from that.
*  No, well, you know, I travel in different circles.
*  And you do a lot of comedians at the table will tell jokes.
*  And these guys are very good at telling them sometimes.
*  So I enjoy jokes.
*  My father told a million jokes.
*  They were funny to me.
*  So I, you know, but in your egghead circles, maybe I could joke tellers.
*  I don't know.
*  How social media changed comedy?
*  Well, it's changed.
*  It came to the rescue in a certain way, because just as wokeness.
*  Put a cloud over everything.
*  Social media allowed some of the most successful comics working today to.
*  Distribute themselves directly to their audience and find their audience.
*  And I think even this includes even Joe Rogan to some extent.
*  And there's no gatekeepers anymore.
*  People like Andrew Schultz, Christopher Stefano and Tim Dillon.
*  So it's given comedy a lifeline in a certain way.
*  It's changed everything, not just comedy, but our business.
*  I mean, like years ago, I had a music club that was hugely successful.
*  The Cafe Huawei lines around the block to get in.
*  It was a huge, like local New York thing.
*  If we had had social media, I mean, the sky would have been the limit.
*  So, I mean, we used to have to stamp postcards if we had an event.
*  And send out a hundred, it was expensive.
*  And now you can announce something to a billion people.
*  So it's rippled through everything, including the ability of comedians
*  to present themselves directly to the audience in a very meritocratic way.
*  You know, you can't argue so much with who rises to the top when people
*  are forwarding things they find funny.
*  But say in the NBA, some people charge, well, dunks, layups,
*  spectacular three point shots have replaced watching actual games.
*  You just pull out bits and you watch highlights.
*  Is comedy becoming just a thing of highlights?
*  And is that in the longer run, good for comedy, bad for comedy?
*  Well, it's taking everybody's attention span on everything, right?
*  Yeah, I would say.
*  It has been, it has done that, although, you know, our club has always been
*  a showcase club as opposed to a headlining club, so we've always
*  opted for shorter bits.
*  I've always found it hard to sit through an hour of somebody's comedy,
*  unless it was, you know, a classic Richard Pryor thing like that.
*  But I think you're right.
*  I mean, I'm overthinking it.
*  Yes, everybody's attention span is shorter and everything, and that's
*  forced comedians to, well, you know what?
*  Having said that, still the real kings like Louis CK and Chappelle and Chris
*  Rock, they really still do take their time with their bits.
*  They spin out long things and they're still on top.
*  They really are, but they're the geniuses.
*  If you take a top YouTuber and put that person on stage at a comedy club,
*  like the Comedy Cellar, how does that person fare?
*  Very badly.
*  Why? What's the difference?
*  It goes back to what we were talking about before.
*  It's not as easy as it looks.
*  When Twitter first started, there was a very famous Twitter.
*  I can't remember his name now.
*  He had a huge number of followings for that era and he was funny.
*  He was very funny on Twitter and he would do some shows and it was just
*  tumbleweeds and crickets, just crickets.
*  It's not that easy.
*  There's a timing, there's a charisma.
*  But isn't YouTube harder in a way because you've got to pretend
*  there's a live audience there.
*  So it takes all the more effort, energy, dynamism.
*  Is it that they overshoot or that they come off flat?
*  What exactly happens?
*  I think YouTube is just different.
*  I've never done it.
*  I don't know that it's harder or easier, but I know that there are certain people
*  who just can fill a room and have, I'll give you an example.
*  Like Chappelle, he has a talent.
*  He can just talk for three hours.
*  Doesn't have to be hitting punch lines and people will just sit
*  there and listen to him.
*  It's hypnotic, he's magnetic.
*  I can't account for that.
*  It wouldn't work on YouTube.
*  I don't think anybody's sitting and watching.
*  And like the only other person I know who has that is maybe like Howard Stern.
*  Somehow he can just talk and talk and talk and people will listen.
*  And it's just a different talent, I think.
*  On Twitter, why are just ordinary people so often funnier than the comedians?
*  Well, that's a great question because this frustrates comics
*  to no end and they won't talk about it.
*  So for instance, I'm pretty funny.
*  If I'm at the comedian table and I say something that's funny, there's a large
*  number of comedians who will not laugh because it makes them uncomfortable to
*  see a civilian be funny.
*  You're a civilian, you're the boss.
*  Well, boss, but a civilian in the sense that, you know, I'm not supposed to be
*  the talent, but a lot of people are extremely funny in person, as funny as
*  standup comics.
*  What they don't have is whatever it is that's driving standup.
*  Well, they might have a few things.
*  They're not comfortable on stage.
*  They may not be charismatic and they're not compelled to be in front of an
*  audience getting laughs.
*  This is something the comedians love.
*  My father used to talk about it.
*  They want to be on stage.
*  They want to be the center of attention.
*  It's not just about being funny.
*  There's a need that they have for this that the average funny person doesn't have.
*  I can be funny.
*  I don't have the urge to be on stage being funny.
*  As a matter of fact, I'm scared of that.
*  I don't follow any comedians and I sit there, I read Twitter and I giggle.
*  So there's maybe a person who's funny once every four years, but the funniest
*  thing they say becomes viral on Twitter.
*  How do comedians compete against hundreds of millions of people who are mostly
*  unfunny, but they have one funny moment every now and then, and then it gets
*  elevated to the top.
*  Yeah, you're asking me questions about things that I've actually thought about
*  even recently.
*  I don't know the answer to that.
*  Exactly.
*  I've been wondering, how is it that some of these comedy-seller comedians are on
*  top, even though they're not actually funnier, and especially since you're only
*  getting the cream of the crop of these tweets.
*  But I guess somehow they are.
*  That's all I can tell you is somehow people who are at the top of this field.
*  Now there's a lot of overachievers in this profession.
*  It's not like the NBA.
*  If you want to be in the NBA, you got to be in the top one-tenth of basketball
*  players in the country, or it's immediately obvious.
*  But you can scratch out and work hard and put together a good 15 minutes.
*  So there are a lot of overachievers working in comedy, but the real super
*  talents, the real gems like the Chapelles, like the Louis CKs, they really are on
*  another level.
*  And the world sees that.
*  I don't know if that's a good answer or not.
*  Why are there so few great comedy movies today?
*  And TV shows, for that matter.
*  It used to be top TV shows were comedies, not all of them.
*  Seinfeld, the clearest example.
*  And now for a long time, HBO, dramas, what happened?
*  Well, I mean, the obvious answer that most people would say is that because you can't
*  make those jokes anymore.
*  And most of the classic comedies had jokes which would be considered off limits today.
*  But if they're not mostly that politically incorrect, like Seinfeld is less politically
*  incorrect than Curb Your Enthusiasm.
*  But there's not a Seinfeld of today, is there?
*  Movies, you can go pretty far out.
*  And most of the funny movies from the past, like Bringing Up Baby, it's pretty funny.
*  It's not politically incorrect at all.
*  It's coming around, that kind of comedy.
*  But I don't know, Tyler, do you have a thought on that?
*  We seem to be getting funny bits in different ways and they're more condensed and they
*  come at a higher information density and we can pull them off the Internet or TikTok
*  whenever we want.
*  And it seems that sates us and we enjoy the feeling of control over comedy, which you
*  don't quite get when you're watching, say, a 100 minute film.
*  That would be my hypothesis.
*  Does that mean that there's movies that have been made which are funny and would
*  deserve the success of a classic comedy?
*  They're just not getting appreciated?
*  No, they don't get made.
*  They don't get made at all.
*  Now, maybe some of them are made for TV, but even there, it all seems less funny to me.
*  But it could also be audiences are themselves less funny.
*  Right.
*  They're more depressed.
*  They're more neurotic.
*  We see some of that in the data, at least for young people.
*  So I suspect that's not the main reason, but part of it.
*  I don't know.
*  And sometimes there isn't a reason.
*  Sometimes there's just a golden age.
*  There's a period where, like, let's compare it to music.
*  Why is music a little bit stagnant now?
*  Maybe that's just the ebb and flow of where it's at.
*  And we're trying to correlate it to something, but it has nothing to do with that.
*  Maybe there's just the great talents are doing other things now or a lot of the
*  jokes have been told.
*  I don't know.
*  But there's definitely golden ages of every art form.
*  But comedy is still in a kind of golden age.
*  It's just not in movies and television.
*  But not in movies.
*  How do you think it changed comedy to be moved away from general outlets?
*  So it used to be there'd be a vaudeville show.
*  You would see something on a showboat, in a saloon, a circus, and parts of it would
*  be funny, but sometimes you'd just be watching the dancing bear.
*  Whereas now today people go to a comedy club in capital letters.
*  Did that evolution matter?
*  Yeah, I don't think it's better.
*  I think, I know that a lot of comedians became a little snobby about that.
*  So for instance, in the Village Underground, we have a band that brings
*  the comedians up on and off the stage.
*  I don't know if you've been to the Underground.
*  No, not yet.
*  And when I first introduced it, I really introduced it because I had to let some
*  musicians go when I was changing the club over to try to include them.
*  And related to what you're saying, the black comics who came up in much more
*  raucous rooms and rooms which were not dedicated.
*  They immediately embraced this.
*  They liked it.
*  They liked the energy.
*  The more clever, you know, white comics, clever is in scare quotes, were very
*  resistant to it at first because this was not purist.
*  In retrospect, most of them have come to me and said, no, I was wrong.
*  The music is great.
*  And we even allow the band a little feature thing.
*  So I think it's not an improvement.
*  I think that a mix of things is better.
*  Catch a Rising Star, which was considered to be the greatest of the New
*  York comedy clubs back in the 80s.
*  They actually did have music acts and the improv had music acts at one time.
*  So now it's true that if it's too much, it can be difficult to settle
*  the room back down to comedy.
*  So there are practical reasons, but I think in general, this kind of
*  snobbery of the art form, as opposed to just being entertaining to an audience,
*  I'm on the side of entertainment.
*  I would love to see a Vaudeville show.
*  Here's a very difficult question that I've never heard a really good answer to.
*  If you take broadly American comedy and then broadly British comedy, and you had
*  to boil down the difference to a smaller number of dimensions as possible, what
*  would that be?
*  You're laughing at me, but I'm not funny.
*  I'm laughing at you because you should be, because you know more about this than I do.
*  No, I don't.
*  You have British comics in, right?
*  Yeah, we have British comics in.
*  They're less politically correct.
*  They're more word oriented, like Jimmy Carr.
*  But I don't know the difference between British stand-up comedy.
*  I don't know enough about it.
*  I would assume it's similar between Monty Python movies and Caddyshack.
*  There's just a different sensibility about it.
*  But the British comics that I see are a self-selected bunch of comedians who come
*  to the comics, and for the comedy show.
*  They're friends of Louis, they're friends of somebody.
*  Somehow they've gotten in the door and they've decided for themselves that this
*  is a good audience for them.
*  So I don't know the answer, but I enjoy British comedy.
*  I think of the Americans as more explicitly presenting themselves in your
*  face as entertainers, and the British comics start off by positioning sort of
*  their class relative to yours in some way.
*  That's one of the fundamental differences.
*  So like when Ricky Gervais did those famous, was it the Golden Globes or
*  whatever it is?
*  Right.
*  Like was that particularly British, would you say, was there something about that,
*  that an American comic wouldn't have done?
*  I didn't see it.
*  Oh, you didn't see it?
*  I don't know.
*  So funny.
*  I mean, it just eviscerated everybody.
*  You know, I don't know if that's because he had more, felt more latitude because
*  he's not from the country, he's British, whatever it is.
*  But it seemed different than an American comic would have done.
*  It was different than the way Michelle Wolf tried to do the same thing for the
*  correspondence dinner.
*  If I think of the earlier history of comedy, I see a lot of comedy double
*  acts, Laurel and Hardy, George and Gracie, Abbott and Costello, Burns and Allen.
*  Those have mostly vanished.
*  What happened?
*  Is the straight man or woman out of fashion?
*  Are they too slow?
*  Is it too slow when you have two people and we need this higher information
*  density of comedy?
*  I don't know.
*  I think the, the, uh, like those acts came up not in comedy rooms, as you say,
*  usually they'd be part of a bill.
*  Sometimes one of them sang, but they would do radio plays.
*  So they had to be able to do a plot on a, maybe I'm trying to think of reasons
*  why, like, you know, it would be that we've, we've had some comedy duos over
*  the year at the, over the years at the comedy cellar, very few, some of them
*  were very funny, but they eventually went their separate ways from each other.
*  Um, I think the, the vehicles that are being used now are just, are just not
*  conducive to a comedy team like they once were.
*  Is it Simon and Garfunkel problem?
*  Like someone thinks he's too good for the group.
*  Well, that's what happened with Jerry Lewis, right?
*  And Dean Martin, I remember my father telling me nobody thought Dean Martin
*  would last like everybody assumed he would, it turned out he did.
*  Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure there's, I don't know if there's a rule of thumb.
*  Everything, every one of these scenarios might be unique in its own way, but
*  definitely the idea that the radio was a central way of presenting things in those
*  days, I think that probably, uh, dictated that a duo was a smart thing to have
*  because you want to have a conversation on the radio and a plot.
*  Abbot and Costello had plots, right?
*  And they were in movies with plots.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's the oldest comedian oldest in the sense of going back in history that you
*  can watch today on YouTube or listen to and still laugh.
*  Um, it's funny comedy doesn't age well, right?
*  It's not like music.
*  It's, it's amazing how it doesn't age well.
*  Um, I find all Don Rickles still funny sometimes.
*  Um, but I find all George Carlin, I will still find like the class clown album.
*  Funny.
*  I thought that the Judd Apatow documentary had a lot of footage of
*  Carlin back in the sixties.
*  I still found that funny.
*  But Cheech and Chong, like they're not funny anymore.
*  Right?
*  I haven't listened to it since I was in high school, but I probably know
*  cause all the weed jokes and whatever, no, it seemed very, very dated.
*  You would have to.
*  Jack Benny, is he still funny?
*  Yeah, I think, I think Jack Benny is still funny.
*  Um, I've seen some, but again, that's mostly, he's still funny in some of the
*  old clips, I haven't heard Jack Benny stand up.
*  Bob Hope is not still funny.
*  I don't remember thinking Bob Hope was funny back then.
*  Even when I was a kid, I was like, who is this guy?
*  Woody Allen, Woody, old Woody Allen standup is funny for sure.
*  Uh, I played some old Bill Cosby stuff for my kids.
*  I think this was before Bill Cosby went out of fashion.
*  Uh, and they loved it.
*  Now, you know, they're, they're kids.
*  They didn't know the backstory.
*  They didn't know that, but they know we loved Bill Cosby as kids.
*  I don't know if you're kind of.
*  Me, it was never funny.
*  It was too boring mainstream.
*  And you know, my, my dad used to always tell me Bill Cosby is a creep.
*  And he would say, you know, someday you'll agree with me.
*  How did he know?
*  He said there were two people he, he would say they were creeps,
*  Bill Cosby and Woody Allen.
*  He had a remarkable intuition for human character.
*  Well, this goes back to what we were talking about at the
*  beginning about these cues.
*  It's amazing.
*  And he never met either one, of course.
*  Now he didn't say anything about a hundred other people, right?
*  No, no, those were the two that he signaled out and demonized.
*  That's remarkable.
*  Yeah.
*  Bob Newhart, was he funny?
*  It's so low key to me.
*  I tried listening to some to prep for this conversation.
*  You know, it's like funny for square people in 1963 or something.
*  Yeah.
*  To me, it wasn't funny.
*  No, I was, I, I don't find it that funny.
*  I went back and not so long ago, listened and watched the Richard
*  Pryor movie where he does the monkey and Leon Spinks and that stuff.
*  And I still found that funny.
*  Um, but it's rare.
*  Comedy does not age well.
*  And, uh, I don't know.
*  Well, I will tell you this.
*  It's not standup comedy, but Chaplin that we play Chaplin all the
*  time in the restaurant.
*  Right.
*  There are nights when the entire restaurant will be laughing at Chaplin.
*  It still captivates me.
*  I'm not sure I'm laughing, but it's very powerful, I think to this day.
*  And the end of city lights where, you know, he holds her hand and he realizes,
*  and she realizes that he's, he's, he's a homeless guy or a bum, but she thought
*  he was this rich man trying to encapsulate a bit too complicated, but anyway, and
*  you'll see multiple people with tears in their eyes at the end of this Chaplin
*  movie in the restaurant.
*  So what accounts for that in your view?
*  Genius.
*  There's no other way.
*  I mean, he was, but he's banned Europe and America, right?
*  He was not quite at home anywhere.
*  Outsider, a little tramp.
*  Refugee.
*  I don't know, but he's the only, we've tried Buster Keaton.
*  We've tried Laurel and Hardy.
*  You know, they did a lot of silent movies before they did talk.
*  We've tried every, uh, we've tried all, we've tried sampling all the
*  greats of the silent era.
*  And none of them seem to attract attention from the patrons other than Chaplin.
*  Also, you know, he's acrobatic.
*  There's roller skating scenes and boxing scenes and trapeze scenes and amazing stuff.
*  WC Fields, the bank dick.
*  I thought still was funny.
*  Yeah.
*  WC Fields is funny and way ahead of his time.
*  And actually I named, well, I didn't, it wasn't my idea, but the name
*  fat like pussy cat, which is one of our rooms is named after the bar in the
*  movie bank dick, although I think it might just be called the fat cat in that movie.
*  And what about comedy across borders?
*  Forget about the Anglosphere, Brits are funny, Canadians, of course, are funny,
*  but people from Israel, France, wherever Germany, if comedy doesn't
*  age well across time, how does, how does it for you age across borders?
*  Apparently people like American comedy all over the world.
*  Americans are not so keen on comedians from other countries.
*  That's it.
*  When we have comedians come here from other countries, I don't think anybody's done that well.
*  Gad Elmela did pretty well for a while.
*  And they're too culturally specific or they're just not funny or how do you
*  account for the difference?
*  It has something to do with the, the, the power of American culture.
*  Like, you know, American culture has been integrated by all the other countries in
*  the world.
*  Somehow they've just grown up, but they get it.
*  They get, they get us.
*  We don't get them.
*  That's, that's my best guess at it.
*  But you think they're quite funny for their local audiences.
*  They clearly are.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They clearly are.
*  Now for how many years have you been running the club?
*  Since 2003, is that 30 years?
*  Over those years across time to comedians to you, are they nicer?
*  Are they meaner?
*  Like how have they changed as a group or class of people?
*  And none of them will be listening to this podcast.
*  So you can say what you really think.
*  How have they changed?
*  Have they changed?
*  They're more aggressive.
*  They're quieter.
*  They are, they are less aggressive.
*  They are, they are more aggressive.
*  They are more careful.
*  They're less bro-y, you know, which, which is considered a bad thing, but the bros were fun.
*  You know, there was, there was a raucous kind of bro atmosphere like the Bill Burr types.
*  Now Bill, a lot of these people are famous now, but they're grandfathered in.
*  But a young Bill Burr would have a tough time.
*  People look like, dude, you need to chill out.
*  You can't say that stuff anymore, you know?
*  So those people are, they've changed in that way.
*  But, but in many ways they're the same.
*  They're still smarter than most people.
*  They're still less easy to offend.
*  They're still much better company.
*  They're still much better company.
*  They, they still, you know, much better conversations, much less boring small talk.
*  There's a, comedians only like to hang out with comedians for these reasons.
*  And they die a thousand deaths when they have to go to a dinner with people who are not comedians.
*  They really don't like it because they cut out all the, all the nonsense.
*  And they're very, very honest and very, very direct.
*  It's coming to me as I'm answering you, they'll, they'll share very personal details with each other
*  in a way that most people won't.
*  Even people they don't even know that well.
*  This is just part of their culture and part of their ethic to be very, very honest.
*  And that's a very kind of captivating conversation to be in.
*  How often do they marry each other?
*  Not that often.
*  Don't they end up unhappy then?
*  Well, there's like Tom Papa is married to his wife Cynthia and they've been married for a long time and very happy.
*  There's some couples they usually break up.
*  Listen, comedians, it's not about marrying other female comedians.
*  Male comedians are notoriously bad at love.
*  Why is that?
*  One might say it's because they're, they're, a lot of them are damaged in some way and that's what makes them funny.
*  It could be the lifestyle.
*  I don't know, but they're not like my law school friends who were all happily married for a long time with children.
*  The comedians, they have, they get divorced a lot or they don't get married at all.
*  So as a group of people, you think they're less happy than say your lawyer friends?
*  Less happy?
*  That's a good question.
*  I think there's a lot of depression.
*  There's a lot of psychotropic drugs.
*  Is that the phrase?
*  A lot of mood drugs being taken by comedians.
*  But if you read the paper, as this is common throughout American culture, so I don't know if it's more or they're just, again, more open about it.
*  Because comedians will tell you, I'm taking this, I'm taking that.
*  I would have to say they're not less happy because they love their work.
*  And they can't wait to go to work.
*  And like my father used to tell me, most people live their whole lives for the weekend.
*  They can't stand going to work.
*  And those people I have trouble believing are happier than comedians.
*  Because anybody, and I have a job similar to this where my whole profession is on my own terms.
*  If I'm interested in computers, I can make that work for my profession.
*  If I have music, whatever it was I wanted to do.
*  This is happiness.
*  So unless they are chemically depressed people, as some people are, I think comedians are probably happier than most people.
*  If there's a truly beautiful woman, can she do stand-up comedy or are the looks an obstacle?
*  Oh yeah, absolutely.
*  Whitney Cummings is very, very funny.
*  I think she's beautiful.
*  She was a model.
*  I know what you're saying, but I don't think it's an obstacle.
*  I don't think it would be an obstacle.
*  Yes, it's true.
*  There haven't been that many truly beautiful women doing stand-up comedy.
*  I would not say that that's the reason.
*  Does the comedy have to change?
*  It might.
*  I think so much of this defies these rules of thumb.
*  I think that when somebody comes along who has something original about them,
*  something about their take on things, something about the way they speak, whatever it is,
*  and it's real, they will become big, regardless of what it is.
*  Again, it's like somebody with a super musical talent like Django Reinhardt, they're missing fingers.
*  They figure out how to play with their toes.
*  When you have real talent, you will make it.
*  The problem is always that that's the top, the 5%, whatever you want to say.
*  Then there is the more mediocre category of people who are successful in stand-up comedy.
*  In that group, then you can maybe attribute these kinds of things that you're talking about.
*  But among the people with super talent, I don't think it matters what they look like.
*  I don't think any of these things hold them back.
*  If you do stand-up comedy for decades at a high level, but not the Louis C.K., Chris Rock level,
*  but you're successful, you appear in your club all the time, how does that change a person?
*  It does change a person, but not so famous that everyone on the street knows who they are.
*  How does doing stand-up comedy change a person?
*  For 25 years, yeah.
*  First of all, it makes it harder for them to socialize.
*  I hear this story all the time about comedians when they go Thanksgiving dinner with their family
*  and all of a sudden the entire place gets silent.
*  Did he just say...
*  Because you get used to being in an atmosphere where you can say whatever you want.
*  I think probably, because I know this in my life,
*  and again, getting used to essentially being your own boss,
*  you get used to that and then it becomes very, very hard to ever consider
*  going back into the structured life that most people expect
*  is going to be their lives from the time they're in school, 9 to 5, whatever it is.
*  So at some point I think if you do it for too long,
*  you would probably kill yourself rather than go back.
*  I've had that thought to myself, if I had to go back to like,
*  I never practiced law, but if I had to take a job as a lawyer,
*  and I'm not just saying this to be dramatic, I think I might kill myself.
*  I can't even imagine at my age having to start going to work at 9 o'clock,
*  having a boss, having to answer for mistakes that I made,
*  having the pressure of having to get it right,
*  otherwise somebody's life is impacted.
*  I just got too used to being able to do what I want when I want to do.
*  Comedians have to get gigs, but essentially they can do what they want
*  when they want to do it.
*  They don't have to get up in the morning.
*  And I think at some point you just become so used to that,
*  there's no going back.
*  I've known a few people who casually, they're not comics,
*  but they do improv comedy at local clubs a few times,
*  and they think this will help them master social situations or give talks.
*  Is that naive, or is there actually some benefit to trying that?
*  John Podharitz, the commentary,
*  he apparently took improv classes for that reason.
*  And I know that public speaking is apparently the number one phobia.
*  I've read that.
*  So I suppose getting used to being in front of an audience in some way
*  would be helpful,
*  but I think the law of diminishing returns probably kicks in pretty quick.
*  It's probably something good to do a little bit.
*  I don't think it's going to help you much to do it for a long time,
*  but I don't know.
*  If there's a young comedian appearing at Comedy Cellar for the first time,
*  you can see they're very nervous.
*  Do you say anything?
*  Can you help them?
*  What do you do?
*  What I try to do is put them at ease if I can.
*  And they're sometimes watching you when you audition them.
*  My booker, Estee, does this way more often, and we speak about it.
*  We try to laugh, try not to let them look at and see a stone face.
*  Try in some way.
*  Now, I know sometimes it's common that the people auditioning people,
*  I don't know if it's a power trip or whatever it is,
*  they don't do that.
*  They'll purposely not show any emotion to the person auditioning,
*  which I think is counterproductive
*  because you're trying to find out how good they are.
*  So why would you not want to do as much as you can
*  to bring the best out of them?
*  So I try to bring the best out of people as much as I can.
*  This was the same thing when I was auditioning musicians,
*  but it's hard because when they're nervous,
*  they're really nervous.
*  It's hard.
*  And just telling them, don't be nervous, is counterproductive?
*  I don't know if it's counterproductive.
*  I don't think it works.
*  I was very nervous to do this interview.
*  You can say anything you want to me.
*  We've gotten one ear and out the other.
*  And I didn't say anything to you, right?
*  We just talked about other stuff.
*  It wouldn't help.
*  We talked about the Beach Boys.
*  Yeah, take my mind off it.
*  How is New York City stand-up comedy different from LA comedy?
*  Well, they say, I don't know, I'm repeating only stuff I've heard,
*  that New York stand-up comedy is more battle-tested,
*  is quicker and funnier and more highly regarded.
*  That's within the stand-up community.
*  I would also say that there's a lot more celebrities at the LA clubs,
*  people like Joe Rogan,
*  and as opposed to here where they're drop-ins,
*  they're on the lineups there.
*  So it's much less stage time for an up-and-coming comic in LA.
*  That's what I'm told.
*  Part of the reason I was nervous about this interview
*  is because I don't think anybody realizes how uninformed I am
*  in a certain way about anything that happens outside my little kingdom here,
*  or that sounds arrogant, but my little environment.
*  And I'm focused on everything that happens around me,
*  and a huge amount of that has nothing to do with comedy.
*  It's about customers being happy and people being friendly
*  and the homeless being made right and whatever it is.
*  So I don't know that much about LA comedy.
*  How does Las Vegas comedy fit into the picture?
*  And there you have a club, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So Vegas audiences are, you know,
*  you'll have more conservatives, more Trump supporters.
*  It's riskier to have a too-political comic there
*  who will start offending the Trump supporters and whatever it is.
*  But other than that, I've found, to my surprise,
*  or not to my surprise, but to the surprise of other people,
*  that audiences are the same.
*  That the people who are funny are funny in Vegas
*  just like they are in New York.
*  Hacks will do a little bit better in Vegas than they will in New York
*  because more people in New York realize
*  that they're hearing something that's not original.
*  But funny is funny, and like people say,
*  maybe you can't send somebody out to Jewie or to whatever.
*  No, it doesn't matter at all.
*  How important is the seating arrangement for a good comedy show?
*  Do you think long and hard,
*  how close together should the seats be?
*  How far away? Looking down, looking up?
*  What's the deal?
*  The most important thing is that everybody should be
*  a little bit closer than they want to be.
*  The claustrophobia of the room, I think, is extremely important.
*  It is not good to have people spread out.
*  We do get complaints from time to time about people being
*  that the seats were too tight,
*  and it's the one complaint I will not address
*  in terms of making changes in the room
*  because I know that it helps.
*  And why does claustrophobia make the comics funnier?
*  It's just the intenseness.
*  The synchronization is stronger within the audience?
*  Definitely the laughs are louder, first of all.
*  You are enjoying it with your friends in a closer physical way.
*  There's just an intensity to it.
*  My answer may not be very eloquent,
*  but obviously anybody can just picture
*  as you spread people out,
*  you can just intuitively understand,
*  well, that's just not going to work.
*  You have to be close together.
*  Louis C.K. once said that in the 1990s,
*  the Comedy Cellar often was empty
*  and there was hardly any audience.
*  Why was that? What happened?
*  Oh, boy, was it.
*  So, first of all, I think it's important to be open.
*  First of all, weeknights at comedy clubs in general
*  were basically empty.
*  Comedy was not the popular thing that it is today.
*  But the Comedy Cellar was, even then,
*  we were the newcomer and the low club on the totem pole.
*  The Improv, the Catcher Rising Star, Caroline's,
*  these were the go-to clubs.
*  And it was so slow that my father used to have
*  the waitresses take off their aprons
*  and all sit in the room, pretend to be customers,
*  so that if somebody would come to the door,
*  they wouldn't think they were the only customer.
*  We went through all sorts of things
*  to try to seed the room.
*  The weekends were always busy
*  because people want to go out on the weekends.
*  But yeah, it was very tough.
*  And actually, those were good old days
*  and it was a lot of fun.
*  Those were good old days in a way
*  because the comedians had much less pressure on them
*  in those days.
*  So they would take chances.
*  They would be hilarious improvised things.
*  I just sent a whole wall full of VHS tapes
*  to a digitizing place in Boston.
*  They actually came to pick it up.
*  It's going to cost a lot of money.
*  And I'll have a lot of that period on video.
*  And you own the IP?
*  No, I don't.
*  You don't?
*  The comedians own it.
*  But I will then share it with them
*  and to the extent that they want to have it released
*  or given to a museum on Sundays.
*  But there will be clips there
*  of people like Louis C.K. performing to like five people.
*  And it'll be a different aspect of Louis C.K.
*  than anybody's ever seen.
*  And it's fascinating, like seeing the Beatles
*  and the Cavern Club or something.
*  So if you were not the top club back then
*  and please feel free to be immodest
*  and be the top club right now,
*  what is it the comedy seller did in the meantime
*  to get you to be the top club?
*  Yeah, that's a good question.
*  And I don't...
*  I mean, what I think it is
*  is that we were
*  the most dedicated...
*  I say this, yeah,
*  it's uncomfortable for me to talk this way,
*  but this is what I believe.
*  We were completely dedicated,
*  always, always, always
*  to doing things the right way
*  in terms of having the best comedians
*  and being...
*  and treating the customers
*  the way we wanted to be treated ourselves.
*  And this is like...
*  To this day, it's an obsession with me.
*  It's harder and harder
*  to keep that mentality
*  as we're so busy
*  among the staff, we'll become complacent,
*  whatever it is, I regard this as a big challenge.
*  And a very important challenge
*  that I have to overcome.
*  But...
*  it was the way we treated the comedians.
*  My grandmother was a very warm host.
*  My father was an extremely warm host.
*  And they ran the club before you did, right?
*  Not my grandmother,
*  but just like a Dwarman family kind of tradition.
*  Like my father knew how
*  to take care of people,
*  treat them nicely.
*  He was a performer himself.
*  He understood the stage
*  from a performer's point of view.
*  So I'll give you a perfect example.
*  To this day, every comedy club
*  has a check spot,
*  which is during the last comedians,
*  they give out the check.
*  Now, the comedians hate this
*  because how can you pay attention
*  to the comic while you're
*  figuring out your check?
*  And from day one, my father said,
*  we're never going to have a check spot.
*  I don't care what it takes.
*  I don't care if it takes longer
*  to turn over the room.
*  I don't care if we lose a show.
*  We're not going to have a performer
*  having to compete with paying a check,
*  especially if he's talking.
*  Like music is bad enough.
*  So this was something he dug in on.
*  And to this day,
*  our competitors have check spots,
*  even their last shows
*  where there is no time constraint.
*  Why? I cannot account for that.
*  But that's that.
*  And from that, you can extrapolate
*  many things that they're probably doing wrong
*  because they don't have
*  their priorities straight.
*  Why don't you charge
*  a higher price for Saturday nights?
*  More people want to go, right?
*  Dude, I just found out today
*  that one of our one of the other
*  clubs is charging 38 New York comedy
*  club, $38 plus a $5 ticket fee,
*  which is just, you know,
*  why would there be a ticket fee?
*  It's just a rip off and an $18 minimum.
*  You're talking about almost twice
*  as expensive as we are.
*  It just seems too much to me.
*  Isn't it seem too much?
*  Who wants to pay that much money?
*  It sounds like a bargain
*  compared to a lot of alternatives.
*  Try going to see the Knicks.
*  Now, that's comedy of its own sort.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I have to take a look
*  at raising my prices.
*  I had no idea.
*  I didn't mention this to you, right?
*  You didn't know.
*  I just saw this today.
*  I didn't know this.
*  $38.
*  And also, I went to a piano
*  bar called the Nines.
*  A drink is $26.
*  And our cover charge on a Saturday
*  night is $26.
*  So maybe I'm out of touch.
*  And I do have to raise the prices
*  in some way, but it's always better
*  to be full.
*  It's always better for people
*  to be able to get the money.
*  It's always better for people
*  to think that they got
*  their money's worth.
*  The longevity
*  can't be measured
*  for that kind of philosophy.
*  And you only know you've
*  blown it when it's too late.
*  You only know you've raised your
*  prices when it's too late.
*  What I do keep track of
*  in terms of metrics
*  for my business
*  is not how much money we take in.
*  It's how many people
*  we turn away every week.
*  Because I know
*  if I see that number dropping,
*  that's when I have a,
*  you know, now I have to react
*  to that number.
*  So this is all kind of
*  related to each other.
*  Now, Esti is your gatekeeper
*  for comedy talent.
*  What makes her so good at that job?
*  He says, my father's genius
*  to hire a booger
*  who didn't speak English.
*  Listen, she gets mad
*  when I say this,
*  but I'm going to be very honest.
*  Knowing who the good comics are
*  is not the challenge.
*  It is obvious to anybody
*  who the good comics are.
*  You could not speak the language
*  and be in the room
*  and know who the funny comics are.
*  You hear the laughter,
*  you see the audience.
*  However, she is tremendously
*  good at other things.
*  She is a Jewish mother.
*  She takes care of them.
*  And, you're going to make me cry
*  if I start,
*  she's extremely loyal.
*  This woman bleeds,
*  comedy seller, blue, more than me.
*  She worries about the club
*  more than me.
*  She had, she broke her rib
*  a few weeks ago
*  in terrible pain.
*  I said, Esti, how are you doing?
*  She goes, oh, in terrible pain.
*  I'm taking care of her.
*  That's why you need to stay home.
*  She goes, stay home as long as you need.
*  She goes, I'm at work.
*  I say, what are you doing at work?
*  She knows she's going to get paid.
*  This is a dedication.
*  You cannot find this anywhere.
*  And people see that in her
*  and they respond to it.
*  I mean, the most famous people
*  in the world,
*  Judd Apatow,
*  John Mayer,
*  they're texting with Esti.
*  They go out to dinner with Esti.
*  They adore her.
*  And that is the magic
*  that she brings to it.
*  How is it that you notice
*  when the level...
*  Can I connect?
*  Sure, sure, please.
*  You know,
*  when Trump used to talk
*  about the deep state,
*  it always rang true to me
*  because every boss has a deep state
*  in his business.
*  Because anybody...
*  So for instance,
*  I have a general manager.
*  I'm not talking about
*  my general manager.
*  And a customer is complaining.
*  Now, the general manager
*  doesn't want to be a manager.
*  The general manager
*  doesn't want to let me know
*  about the customer complaint
*  because in some way
*  this reflects on her
*  management of the place.
*  So immediately
*  the incentives are all bad.
*  That's why it's always better
*  for your customer
*  to ask for the owner
*  because the owner
*  is the only one
*  who really, really cares.
*  It has no...
*  Esti is completely loyal.
*  There is zero deep state
*  with Esti.
*  And this, as a boss,
*  is something you may never have.
*  And when you do have it,
*  it's priceless.
*  I cannot tell you
*  the sense of ease I have
*  that I can speak with her
*  totally candidly,
*  totally frankly
*  about any comedian,
*  about anything in the world.
*  And I know it stays between us.
*  She'll never, ever let it on.
*  It's an amazing thing.
*  How is it that you notice
*  when the level of the light
*  in the club is dimmed
*  ever so slightly?
*  I just notice.
*  This is...
*  My father had it.
*  I have it.
*  I can walk into a room
*  and I notice it immediately.
*  People I've trained
*  who are there every day
*  don't notice.
*  I'm like, don't you see that?
*  Oh, yeah, you're right, boss.
*  I didn't see that.
*  This is just...
*  It's like, you know,
*  it's a talent.
*  I'll cop to it.
*  It's a talent.
*  What's the craziest
*  government regulation
*  Comedy Cellar has to follow?
*  Well...
*  The...
*  The dumbest thing,
*  it's not huge to me,
*  is that when they raise
*  the minimum wage,
*  they raise it for tipped employees
*  rather than the people
*  who are working hard
*  in the kitchen, let's say.
*  Now, our servers...
*  I think finally you're caught up
*  with everybody.
*  Our servers make,
*  as a waitering job,
*  quite a bit of money.
*  You know, some of them can make
*  $100,000 a year.
*  They would pay me to work here.
*  I'm not suggesting they do.
*  They...
*  But the regulations really
*  didn't take care of for a while.
*  And I said, I think the minimum wage
*  may have caught up now.
*  They did not take care of the people
*  who were really laboring hard
*  at low wages.
*  I thought that was
*  a tremendous mistake.
*  The sum total of the regulations
*  is crazy.
*  It's death by a thousand cuts.
*  So then we wanted to move
*  a wall downstairs
*  to expand the kitchen by,
*  I don't know, seven feet.
*  This was something we could have
*  done without even closing.
*  In order to comply with the law,
*  we were closed for like
*  six or seven months.
*  You have to get landmark
*  permission.
*  One thing after another,
*  after another, after another.
*  We can't put in a bathroom
*  because then we'd have to renovate
*  the bathrooms downstairs
*  and have room for it.
*  There's so many things.
*  We're very, very fortunate
*  because we're established
*  and we're successful.
*  But you wonder how it is
*  that a new business
*  can overcome these costs.
*  My father started
*  his first place.
*  He was driving...
*  He was a cab driver.
*  The notion that a cab driver
*  could aspire
*  to opening a restaurant
*  in the village now,
*  it's impossible.
*  He couldn't do it.
*  Coleman Hughes says,
*  I should ask you
*  for your 9-Eleven story.
*  Oh my God.
*  He gave me help.
*  I spied on you.
*  Did he really?
*  Of course he did.
*  All right.
*  Well, this is not
*  a flattering story at all.
*  I don't know that.
*  I guess I will.
*  I'll try to do it short.
*  So, you know,
*  when I was younger,
*  not anymore.
*  Listen, I was a musician
*  and I was a singer.
*  Listen, I was a musician.
*  I'm not proud of it,
*  but I was...
*  I was caroused.
*  I was not faithful
*  to girlfriends.
*  Whatever.
*  I'm just copping to it.
*  I can't believe...
*  I can't believe.
*  Because I texted Coleman today
*  like he's like,
*  it'll be fine.
*  Don't worry about it.
*  And then the only bad question
*  was from him.
*  So I had decided
*  that the only way
*  you could have an affair,
*  I wasn't married,
*  God forbid,
*  was that you
*  and the woman
*  had to be the only two people
*  who know about it.
*  So I had this girlfriend.
*  I said, we're going to go
*  to Washington, D.C.
*  And I didn't tell anybody.
*  And I can't believe
*  you're doing this.
*  And I was in a hotel
*  and my cell phone is ringing
*  and ringing and ringing
*  and ringing and I don't
*  want to answer it.
*  And finally I answer it
*  and there's someone working
*  in the office calling
*  on behalf of my father.
*  Where are you?
*  Where are your fathers going?
*  I said, I'm in D.C.
*  And then I spoke to
*  my father's wife.
*  I'm in D.C.
*  And they're like,
*  don't you understand
*  what's happened?
*  I had no idea.
*  Turn on the TV.
*  So I turned on the TV
*  and it was 9-11.
*  The World Trade Center
*  is full.
*  I said, well, I'm in D.C.
*  That's all I say.
*  So then my girlfriend,
*  now my wife,
*  my wife knows the story,
*  her mother,
*  I'm really trying
*  to condense the story,
*  shows up to the olive tree.
*  That's the attached restaurant
*  for the listeners who don't know.
*  Looking for her daughter
*  who, and she sees my stepmother
*  and she says,
*  have you seen Juanita and Ava?
*  And my son says,
*  it's okay, they're in D.C.
*  And my wife's mother says,
*  she's not in D.C.
*  I just saw her two hours ago
*  and then it dawned on her.
*  So I got busted on 9-11
*  and I just remember
*  you couldn't get back
*  to Manhattan
*  and it was a mess.
*  I was in Manhattan
*  and it was burning.
*  I hope it burns and burns
*  and I just keep putting it off
*  and putting it off.
*  It was the most horrible thing.
*  But I will tell you
*  an interesting aspect of that.
*  And this story has been written up
*  in a book, by the way,
*  if anyone wants to get
*  the long version of it.
*  When we went out
*  into D.C. that day,
*  there was nobody
*  at the White House.
*  Sure.
*  And we were able,
*  we began to walk down the path
*  realizing we could walk
*  into the building
*  like January 6th.
*  And then I got scared.
*  I said, you know what?
*  This is probably not
*  something we should do.
*  And I chickened out
*  and I went the other way.
*  Before cell phones had cameras.
*  But it was like
*  I Am Legend or something.
*  It was the most amazing
*  thing I've ever seen.
*  I just happened to be there
*  and I couldn't capture it
*  but deserted.
*  Just like you could just walk
*  right into the government
*  buildings.
*  It's crazy.
*  Is there an alternate
*  universe where you become
*  a professional musician,
*  a guitarist?
*  Yes, there is.
*  I would say that.
*  I mean, I was a very good
*  musician in high school.
*  I was hired as an accompanist
*  for a classical ute player
*  and I played Carnegie Hall
*  and a number of important
*  of those types of rooms.
*  I was recommended
*  to study with Segovia.
*  I was considered to be a
*  a lute player.
*  A lute player?
*  No, I mean, yeah.
*  Oud, oud, oud.
*  Okay, oud, yeah.
*  Which is, you know,
*  oud is oud.
*  Yes, yes.
*  The oud was the
*  forewarners of the lute.
*  And then I had a whole career
*  playing music.
*  I was pretty successful at it
*  and I was good.
*  Not a genius musically.
*  Like I play with some people
*  who I could never play
*  like they can play.
*  But I was always the leader.
*  I always became the leader
*  in any situation
*  even with musicians
*  who were better than me
*  in certain ways.
*  It was something about
*  it's related to being
*  knowing when the lights
*  are up and down.
*  There was something about
*  my sensibility musically.
*  I will say this about myself,
*  which was unique to me
*  and very good.
*  And that's why to this day
*  like I still play
*  with the very, very
*  best musicians in the world
*  will come down
*  and hang out in the olive tree
*  and
*  And you're playing
*  electric guitar then?
*  Now I play like a nylon
*  electric guitar, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But as a bandleader
*  more than anything else
*  that was really something
*  that I was just naturally good at.
*  The old Burt Bacharach song
*  Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head
*  what are the chords?
*  Oh, I know the C, C major 7, C7
*  I can tell you all the chords.
*  For like all the songs?
*  By anyone?
*  Coleman says you can.
*  Not as, not, Coleman
*  no, not all the songs
*  not by anyone.
*  I'm pretty good at it.
*  I don't have perfect pitch
*  people with perfect pitch
*  are always better at it.
*  I'm not as good as this guy
*  Nick Casarino who plays with me
*  he will have a higher
*  batting average.
*  I'm not a genius.
*  I'm not, but I'm very good.
*  But you know, a lot of people
*  like you hear all Beatle records
*  Paul McCartney's making mistakes.
*  You know, music has so many
*  different aspects
*  that go into it
*  in terms of what it means
*  to be a great musician.
*  There's artistic aspects to it
*  there's strategic aspects to it
*  there's sensitivity aspects to it
*  there's all sorts of things.
*  Beach Boys, I Get Around
*  what makes it a great song?
*  Well, it's just
*  first of all, that introduction
*  it's so fresh
*  this barbershop kind of sound
*  with this rock music
*  I mean, as a kid I can remember
*  vividly the first time I heard it
*  I'd never heard anything like it
*  it's always impressive to me
*  when something comes out of nowhere
*  and you can't even trace it
*  as a progression of what came before
*  that's what those Beach Boys songs
*  were like to me
*  that's like the first time I heard
*  I Want to Hold Your Hand
*  these kind of things
*  I'm not exactly unique
*  the first time I heard
*  Teen Spirit, the Nirvana song
*  there's just something about
*  and again, I'm saying this
*  but everybody says that
*  First time I heard
*  Strawberry Fields Forever
*  maybe I was 10
*  I couldn't believe it
*  So I Get Around has that
*  Now I Get Around
*  is very sophisticated harmonically
*  it's got a key change
*  and it goes down a step afterwards
*  and it comes back
*  I think he finishes where he started
*  I mean, you can't say enough
*  about Brian Wilson
*  this guy's a real genius
*  Who's the most underrated guitarist
*  in your view?
*  The guitar players
*  who are not fancy
*  like Paul McCartney
*  whose touch is magically
*  you can tell it's him immediately
*  like Paul Simon
*  James Taylor gets more credit
*  but is also more of a guitarist
*  but is also not understood
*  to be the genius that he is
*  because he basically
*  invented an entire style
*  nobody plays like him
*  nobody sounds like him
*  and nobody played like that
*  before him
*  Willie Nelson's soloing
*  I know that people like
*  Miles Davis
*  they get it
*  because it's so simple
*  it's all phrasing
*  it's something that anybody
*  would think they could do
*  but they can't quite do it
*  like him
*  it's kind of like
*  Sinatra's singing
*  nobody gets that
*  but yet everybody
*  can't believe how good he is
*  but he's not
*  he's not singing like
*  Ella Fitzgerald
*  he's not singing like
*  Tony Bennett
*  it's almost approachable
*  you'd think you could almost
*  sing like Sinatra
*  but you can't
*  the guitar players like that
*  I've listed some of them
*  those are the people
*  I really admire
*  I really don't
*  I never did enjoy
*  the fancy guitar players
*  like the guitar gods
*  because that's not really
*  my approach to music
*  I'm more song oriented
*  I like the songs
*  I like the
*  I even like the solos
*  that are not necessarily
*  improvised
*  the fact that you
*  mastered the oud
*  which is unusual right
*  how has that shaped
*  your understanding
*  of rock and roll
*  in popular music
*  what is it that
*  you see differently
*  well
*  I'll broaden out that answer
*  because I don't think
*  I mastered the oud
*  but you played it well
*  I'll just say
*  I was very lucky
*  I wish my father were alive
*  for you to meet him
*  I had very broad
*  influences in my home
*  and a total lack
*  of snobbery
*  about anything
*  and actually
*  this is why I take
*  to you in a way
*  I think you have that too
*  so
*  anything that was considered
*  to be great
*  within its culture
*  the greatest Arabic music
*  the great whatever it was
*  it was assumed
*  that it was upon me
*  to learn why it was great
*  and then
*  and you can do that
*  you bury yourself in it
*  you'll always have
*  an accent at it
*  but at some point
*  you get used to it
*  and then you begin
*  to be able to discern
*  the good from the bad
*  and then
*  somehow that becomes
*  part of your vocabulary
*  and how you play
*  and that just happens
*  you can't really play
*  and you can't really play
*  and you can't really play
*  and then that just happens
*  you can't really plan that
*  so in some way
*  having all these influences
*  made me unique
*  in a certain way as a musician
*  but unique in everything
*  that I do
*  I like to think
*  because
*  I don't know
*  I try to be very open minded
*  I hope the answer
*  answers meanders a little bit
*  but I do think
*  these things are connected
*  it's an idea
*  that's not limited to music
*  it's just an approach
*  to the world
*  and you're the best example
*  I know of this
*  thank you
*  the Greenwich Village
*  live music scene
*  does that have a future?
*  aren't the rents too high
*  too many tourists come here
*  will it all just become stupid?
*  I think it's done
*  the um
*  when I started
*  a music club in 88
*  everybody had live music
*  there was live music everywhere
*  not just on Bleecker Street
*  but throughout the city
*  a few things happened
*  at the same time
*  first of all
*  fewer and fewer people
*  play the kind of music
*  which is practical
*  for live venues
*  much more electronic
*  and hip hop
*  and whatever it is
*  number one
*  number two
*  rents got higher
*  and landlords
*  don't want noise
*  and neighbors don't want noise
*  and it's almost impossible
*  to control the noise
*  and um
*  DJs became
*  super popular on their own
*  and DJs are way cheaper
*  and
*  more predictable
*  in what they're going to do
*  you know you hire some live band
*  you don't know
*  what they're going to play
*  if they'll show up
*  there's so many reasons
*  that like
*  when I was a kid
*  McDougall Street was so
*  now this was
*  you know
*  during the folk rock era
*  when the Lovin' Spoonfuls
*  was around the corner
*  and Dylan was
*  McDougall Street was so busy
*  you couldn't even walk down the street
*  the cars had to go
*  you know like
*  at a tiny pace
*  just it was a flood of people
*  you can see this a little bit
*  in the movie
*  The President's Analyst
*  I don't know if you ever saw it
*  this Clips of the Village
*  in those days
*  and then it just
*  has decayed ever since
*  and I think live music
*  I don't think it's coming back
*  anywhere in New York
*  I don't think so
*  I mean
*  I shouldn't say never
*  but
*  I mean like my Monday night
*  live music that I do with Coleman
*  it's pretty popular
*  but um
*  I don't think
*  but it's very small
*  and
*  I couldn't even imagine
*  succeeding at a live music club now
*  you can do it with famous acts
*  but the kind of
*  non-famous live music club
*  no
*  and that's partly why
*  comedy's gotten busier too
*  comedy in certain ways
*  replaced music
*  as a thing people go to do
*  final question
*  what will you do next?
*  well
*  we just closed
*  on a
*  the biggest thing I've ever done
*  which is a new building
*  on
*  Third Street
*  was the former McDonald's
*  and I want to open
*  a
*  room that hopefully
*  be the flagship room
*  which will be a very very intimate
*  200 seat
*  theaterish kind of place
*  with a mezzanine
*  I'm doing that also largely
*  because I have kids
*  and I want them to
*  I want to have enough
*  that they don't have to fight over it
*  I've seen so many families torn apart
*  fighting over
*  estates and things like that
*  I'm trying to keep having fun
*  again one of the things
*  I admire about you
*  and I think
*  as I get to know you
*  and I'm more comfortable
*  speaking with you
*  but I think that
*  we're similar
*  only in the sense that
*  I think you're
*  trying to
*  live life on your own terms
*  and
*  do exactly what you want to do
*  and enjoy exactly
*  what you want to do
*  when you want to do it
*  and
*  that has really been the joy
*  of
*  my life so far
*  and that's what I'm trying
*  to do
*  now I have kids
*  that's a huge joy in my life
*  so I don't know exactly
*  what I'll do next
*  after that
*  it'll be whatever
*  I want to do
*  that I'm interested in
*  at the time
*  to enjoy myself
*  that's really
*  the way it's been all along
*  Noam Dorman of Comedy Cellar
*  thank you very much
*  thank you Tyler
*  thank you very much
*  great
*  was it okay?
*  it'll be a great episode
*  it'll be a huge hit
*  you
