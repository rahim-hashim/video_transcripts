# Brian Koppelman on TV, Movies, and Appreciating Art  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU_9sZWZ2VM)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm chatting with Brian Kopelman, who is a producer, director, and screenwriter.
*  He's the co-writer of the movie Ocean's 13 and the movie Rounders, the producer for films
*  including The Illusionist and The Lucky Ones, the director for films including Solitary
*  Man with Michael Douglas, and the documentary This Is What They Want for ESPN, and the co-creator,
*  showrunner and executive producer of Showtime's Billions and super pumped The Battle for Uber.
*  And his podcast is The Moment and my own daughter thinks this is one of the sagest sources of
*  the life advice out there.
*  Brian, welcome.
*  That's awesome to hear because as you know, my son Sam certainly has a high opinion of
*  you and your work and it's funny to me that you two know one another really before you
*  and I knew each other.
*  And she knows you I think more as a podcaster than as a movie and TV person.
*  Awesome, that's great.
*  I love people who interact with me via podcast and who get on the wavelength that I'm on
*  the pod.
*  I do feel very connected to and I understand why they're connected to me.
*  So that's great.
*  These people like us more somehow, right?
*  Isn't that strange?
*  It is but they do.
*  Do you feel this way?
*  I do think that someone who's listened to enough of The Moment, enough episodes of The
*  Moment, they do have a sense of the things that animate me and the things that animate
*  me are so much a part of who I am that in a sense they do really know me or they know
*  a part of me or they know me when I'm trying to access the part of me that's most alive,
*  the best of myself.
*  And so when I meet someone and they're a person who spent a lot of time engaged in that way,
*  it's not hard to find a way to connect.
*  Do you feel that way too?
*  Absolutely.
*  Some of the people who think they don't know me, in fact they do know me, they just can't
*  believe that's what it means to know me.
*  Like that's it.
*  Yes.
*  And well, I think also though, one, it's hard to believe that somebody has not only the
*  catholicity of interest and knowledge that you have but the depth of interest and knowledge
*  that you have.
*  So when I'm sure when someone meets you, they're trying to understand how a human being has
*  that entire range.
*  Thank you.
*  I have some very simple questions for you about the history of television to start with.
*  So I grew up in the 1970s and I've long wondered why was TV so bad for so long before the so-called
*  golden age?
*  Maybe you could date that to the 90s or the 80s, but why weren't shows in the 70s and
*  80s better than they were?
*  Or would you challenge that premise?
*  Well, you know, I also grew up in the 70s.
*  I was born in 66.
*  And I'm not sure that the hypothesis that it was bad is correct.
*  It certainly wasn't in general as an art form operating on the level that cinema was operating
*  on or the level that music in part was operating on during that time.
*  But if we look at, say, children's television, I could argue that Jim Henson and Sesame Street,
*  for what it was and aimed at what it was aimed at, was as important as any television that's
*  on today.
*  So I would say that Jim Henson moved the art form forward.
*  He figured out a use case for TV that hadn't really been done before.
*  And he created a way of thinking about the medium that was really different.
*  And then, look, Hill Street Blues shows up in the 80s and I think figures out how to
*  use certain techniques of theater and cinema and novels to tell these TV stories.
*  And like any other business, when that started to connect, then people in the business started
*  to become aware of what was possible.
*  And so, yeah, it was a function of three channels to answer your question.
*  Yeah, in the main, of course, TV was worse.
*  No doubt about it.
*  But there were high points.
*  And I think those high points pointed the way toward the high points that came later.
*  Like for me, NYPD Blue is the network show that's fully on the level of any of these
*  shows that came after.
*  And you know, David Milch cuts his teeth on Hill Street Blues.
*  There's a wonderful book by Brett Martin called Difficult Men that's about showrunners.
*  And it starts, in a way, with Bochko and Milch in that time period.
*  And it's a great look into how this idea of showrunners created modern television.
*  And you know, HBO needing something, all these sort of business reasons underneath it.
*  But how people who came up through originally Hill Street were able to kind of go on and
*  start this revolution.
*  And in your view, how good really was I Love Lucy?
*  Is it just a few memorable moments like Vitamin and Vegemin?
*  Or is it actually a show where it'd be good episode after good episode?
*  Like the surprise?
*  Well, you know, I was going to say, like, we could look at shows.
*  So obviously, she was an incredible physical performer, an incredible comedian.
*  Her timing was amazing.
*  But also, when you asked the question, I started thinking about the 50s.
*  And I started thinking about directors like Sidney Lumet and people who became world class
*  directors of cinema and who started by directing those live television presentations, right?
*  Those plays and all that stuff on TV in the 50s.
*  And so, look, it was the dawning of an industry.
*  It was the dawning of this art form in a real way.
*  I Love Lucy has incredible moments.
*  I've certainly seen every single episode.
*  And I think probably not just because making this stuff is my job.
*  It was never ever a moment that it was my favorite show.
*  But I love Westerns.
*  I grew up watching Westerns with my dad and Chuck Conner, The Rifleman.
*  It might not be a good show, but I think there are elements in that that are synchronous
*  with movies and have similar iconography.
*  And maybe we're able to deliver that in a digestible way that made you curious about
*  what else was out there, like what that was inspired by or what that was inspiring.
*  So if we move to the current day, there are many quite good TV shows, but why aren't there
*  many more?
*  What is the scarce factor?
*  Is it directors?
*  Is it money?
*  Is it viewers caring?
*  Is it screenwriting?
*  All of the above.
*  How should I think about that as an economist?
*  Well art, as you know, because you are such a dedicated consumer and thinker about great
*  art.
*  You can hear a piece and it does something to you.
*  And yes, like if we look at a music, if we look at I like we look at Bitches Brew just
*  for a second and how it was received in its time and how people think of it now.
*  On the one hand, we could say, well, music can be reduced to just frequencies.
*  And so these frequencies, for whatever reason that we don't yet understand, are pleasing
*  to us.
*  And you may say, well, one has to come to Bitches Brew with an understanding of bebop,
*  this whole thing.
*  Or I might say to you, I don't think so.
*  I think you could put that record on.
*  In fact, to somebody who doesn't come in expecting jazz to be something and they might be hit
*  with it in a way that suddenly it nails them.
*  Which is to say that the effect that storytelling art has is in a sense, because we don't understand
*  why, it's magic.
*  And so when you ask why there's not more that's better, it's like it always comes down, of
*  course, as an economist, you might say, well, how are we incentivizing people to make this
*  stuff?
*  How are we drawing the best people into it?
*  And I do think on the whole, television is a writer's medium and that you need to incentivize
*  and reward writers to be willing to turn themselves inside out to create amazing stuff.
*  But I might flip it and say, how much truly amazing stuff is there in any given art form
*  at any given time you might take a snapshot of it?
*  Because so much stuff has to come together.
*  The writing has to be incredible.
*  First of all, the concept has to be one that nails the moment in time.
*  I mean, the way Franzen was talking about the duty you have to write the great American
*  takes in in some way processes the world that you're living in.
*  That could be a science fiction novel, right?
*  It could be a historical novel, but in some way it is hitting off the times in which you
*  live.
*  So a great piece of television, whether it's Mad Men, whether it's the Larry Sanders show,
*  whether it's NYPD Blue that I was talking about earlier, or if it's the Sopranos, it
*  needs to conceptually be something that the times want to engage with.
*  It needs to have a writer or writers with an incredibly clear sense of purpose, and
*  they have to be talented enough and ready to give what it takes.
*  And then the magical alchemy of their words, the camera, and that group of actors has to
*  take flight.
*  And so you can hire really talented people, and sometimes it doesn't work, and sometimes
*  suddenly, almost miraculously, it really does work.
*  And so this is why someone like David Milch, and that's another book I would recommend
*  is Milch's book, which is one of the best, maybe the best book ever written about television,
*  the one that came out last year.
*  When you think about a guy like that, it was able to write some of the best episodes of
*  Hill Street and then NYPD Blue and then create Deadwood.
*  That does feel to me as somebody who does this stuff miraculous.
*  Why has Israeli TV been so good in the last 10 years?
*  Srugeim, Shatisel, Prisoners of War, there's a lot more actually.
*  There are great shows.
*  I don't know that that's...
*  I want to give you an answer, but what I really think is one thing I've learned.
*  All right, when your daughter says this stuff about that there are things that she hears
*  me say, I would say one of the things that I really have felt the older I've gotten is
*  just an incredible comfort in saying I don't know.
*  Whatever that amalgam of things are that's created the ground to be fertile enough and
*  then the artists to be ready to make the work that they're making and to have it connect,
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't studied it, so I don't have a ready-made answer for you.
*  I think in a more global sense, we're pulling back from 30,000 feet.
*  There was a moment when I thought South Korean cinema was just incredible.
*  It's been for a long time.
*  I remember watching this series of eight or 10 or 12 movies.
*  I had a thought that it was a moment in time where the movies from South Korea, without
*  ever mentioning what it feels like to have North Korea as your neighbor, as this bully,
*  as this invasion of your psyche, they would never say that.
*  The movies weren't about that at all.
*  Yet receiving those movies, I felt part of why they were so potent was that they were
*  suffused with that idea somewhere in the consciousness of the people making it.
*  It had that kind of effect because you felt this need for freedom.
*  You felt this sense of encroaching doom, this sense of wanting to define themselves, the
*  people in the movies and the filmmakers.
*  Perhaps something similar is going on.
*  Anytime a certain area starts to produce work that's really good and important, but
*  I haven't given the Israeli stuff the same amount of thought that I gave that South Korean
*  stuff a few years back.
*  I just watched Old Boy on a large screen for the first time.
*  Do you like that one?
*  Well, that's a great one.
*  For me, yeah, it's an incredible movie, the original.
*  For me, Bad Boy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, those are two that I think are great.
*  There are many, many movies from 10 years ago and 12 years ago from Korea that are,
*  I'll text you a list that are just great.
*  Mother is very good.
*  Memories of a Murder is the earliest one I know.
*  I haven't seen that one.
*  I know I haven't seen that one.
*  Somehow I missed that one.
*  No, I missed it.
*  I missed it for sure.
*  When people watch TV shows, often these days they binge, so they'll watch many episodes
*  in a row.
*  I don't do that.
*  I like to watch something like one a week.
*  At the margin, do you want to have your viewers binging more or binging less?
*  What do you prefer?
*  How do you think about that trade-off?
*  I loved the experience of watching Mad Men week to week, and I'm so glad that I got to
*  watch it week to week.
*  It was almost like a holy day in our house.
*  Amy and I would start taping it so it would just get a little run up before you would
*  start because Mad Men actually had commercials, oddly enough.
*  Even the later years, very few commercials and they would chunk it so that it was great.
*  There's something about the anticipation and then seeing something when it airs.
*  When Twitter was slightly different, I really loved having a conversation on Twitter after
*  a show that was meaningful.
*  You would watch the second to last episode of Mad Men and then you could see what Seppenwald
*  was saying on Twitter and you could talk to him and you could talk to Matt Zoller's sites
*  and you could engage in that way.
*  That was incredibly fun.
*  The Crown is probably my favorite show, the bear and the crown.
*  I'd say both the bear and the crown, Amy and I binge those shows.
*  The experience this year of watching the bear was an extraordinary experience to binge it
*  because I felt like I was immersed in Christopher Storr's imagination in the way he saw the
*  world.
*  It was like reading a novel and the kind of novel, even a big novel that you read in a
*  weekend and that's what we did.
*  We watched on a Saturday and Sunday and it was an incredible experience.
*  But I think to binge something like that, the show needs to be great.
*  We also picked moments to stop.
*  We picked moments to stop and think about it and talk about it and then picked a moment
*  to stop and wait till the next day.
*  I think both things are rewarding.
*  I feel like The Crown is built to binge and the way that it accretes really works in a
*  binge model.
*  I have a feeling that Mad Men, because there were so many quiet moments in Mad Men, because
*  Mad Men was about visual images and about symbolism, I think because his business was
*  about semiotics.
*  And so when you would be able to walk away and think about what you saw, it was really
*  rewarding.
*  The Crown is rewarding too in those ways, but I think they're built slightly differently.
*  David and I don't really think about it in making billions.
*  I think we just want the whole thing to add up, to accrete as I say, but also we do want
*  you to be able to watch it in discreet.
*  Was combining food and television viewing, did that make American food worse?
*  Because Europeans don't do that so much.
*  Oh yeah, eating at the kitchen table, watching is absolutely, yes.
*  Look, I love the question.
*  Well yeah, you should eat your food, have a conversation with yourself or your family,
*  depending on your situation, and then get ready and watch stuff.
*  On the other hand, if you've worked really hard all day and you just want to sit down
*  and eat and watch something, I mean, I feel like for certain things I do think there's,
*  I'll use the word read to read them, I do think that there's a wrong and a right way
*  to read certain pieces of material.
*  On the other hand, it's entertainment.
*  And so if people want to be entertained while eating a burger and watching the thing, I
*  think that's all right.
*  I think that people making stuff, to a person I would say, just to circle to your question
*  earlier, man, people making this stuff are trying really hard to make it as well as they
*  can.
*  And the answer is never that they're not sort of working themselves to their greatest capacity
*  given their level of exhaustion.
*  But I don't think then they require you to watch it under certain circumstances.
*  I think you want certain people watching it that way.
*  Someone writing about the, you know, I would prefer that someone writing about the work
*  is focused on it.
*  But I would, you know, how do you feel about audio books?
*  Do you feel that somebody ought to run listening to one of your books is having an experience
*  similar to the experience of sitting down with a pen and underlining when they read
*  it?
*  Or is it not at all similar to that?
*  If I was reading it, I would feel fine about it.
*  I don't like to listen to audio books.
*  But if my readers are listening, I think that's great.
*  But the people who read them, they're somehow weird and corny.
*  And I feel it ought to sound like me.
*  And it doesn't.
*  And I get that if it sounded like me, it might sell fewer copies.
*  But I don't care about that.
*  I would if I were you, I would insist on doing it yourself.
*  You don't do it yourself now?
*  You know, my last book, they thought, oh, you know, you should do it yourself.
*  Then they got the book.
*  They're like, well, we're going to have someone come in and do this.
*  Again, it was probably an OK commercial decision.
*  But it sounds like a Martian.
*  Oh, I feel like it's really crucial.
*  I couldn't agree with you more.
*  I really want authors reading their own books.
*  And I want to feel the intonation from the author, and particularly someone whose voice
*  is so familiar to people now from the podcast.
*  I feel like if I bought your book on audio, I'd want to hear you reading your book.
*  Well, we will see.
*  Is there a television purchase that you would be willing to recommend to our listeners?
*  You watch why you think it's best.
*  No, because things change.
*  And the truth is, your settings, so many I think they're such a high quality now in the
*  televisions where people get screwed up is in the settings.
*  Like, you've got to go in there. You've got to read.
*  Go pull up like a cinematography magazine and just pull up what cinematographers tell
*  this. Ryan Johnson's talked about this online, the great director and writer.
*  And like I asked Ryan when I got the last TV I got, I wrote I asked Ryan to just tell me what
*  to set my television up to.
*  And I just set it up to exactly his specs so that now it looks great.
*  And that online somewhere.
*  Oh, yeah, you can find that it's just turning off.
*  It's just turning off a bunch of the stuff that's set up for watching sports only.
*  And and it will it really fixes it and returns it to looking like you want it to look as
*  close as it it can.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, let's say we put you in charge completely and you get to redesign multiplex movie theaters.
*  You can't make them like the Hollywood palaces of the 20s.
*  But within reason, what are the changes you would make to improve the movie watching
*  experience? This is not about making more money.
*  It's about making the movie better.
*  What would you do?
*  Well, you started like a good Dungeons and Dragons dungeon master.
*  You started by taking away the first thing I would do, right?
*  You made it more difficult.
*  I mean, the first thing I would do is make sure you could have a zig field like screen
*  because that big screen is immersive and you're lost in that and the sound quality.
*  I mean, I think this stuff's I think it's basic.
*  Like if.
*  Greta Gerwig or Chris Nolan are there setting up their movie to look a certain way.
*  Whatever you need to do in the movie theater to recreate the experience that they last
*  had when they approved it, sound and picture, sometimes you'll walk into a theater and
*  it won't be bright enough, like it won't be to enough candles, right?
*  So that stuff drives us nuts or they won't have it.
*  It's just like I would just want people to really care.
*  The projection is to care that people setting the thing up, make sure that it's like lit
*  properly, make sure that all the speakers are working properly, make sure that the sound
*  ratio is what the filmmakers wanted.
*  I'm those are my modest sort of beginning things.
*  Right. And then I do love seeing a movie on a giant screen like seeing Mission Impossible,
*  even at the IMAX, a proper 70 millimeter IMAX was a phenomenal movie going experience.
*  I mean, there was only 13, I think, proper IMAX 70 millimeter theaters in the country.
*  And it's you know, there's one or 10 blocks from me in New York City.
*  And it's a thrill to go to that theater to see a movie every time I go see a movie there.
*  For you as viewer, how crowded do you want the movie theater to be?
*  I'd like two thirds to three quarters full or totally empty, depending on the film.
*  Nothing in between. What's your view?
*  My very favorite time to see a movie is the first screening of the day on a Saturday morning.
*  And probably my second favorite would be a really full screening on a Friday night where I
*  have the seat that I like, which is dead center, but the aisle.
*  And I love an early morning seeing a film like I remember seeing Trialife, that great Terrence
*  Malick film at the old Lincoln Center Theater.
*  You go downstairs, the independent cinema.
*  And I was a Saturday morning and I was alone and I felt like I was alone with Malick's vision.
*  That theater cared a lot.
*  The screens were small, but they cared a lot about the screens being accurate.
*  And I felt lost for three plus hours.
*  I was in a reality that I didn't normally live in and I didn't create.
*  And I was experiencing the world the way Terrence Malick saw the world.
*  And that is an experience that I wish everybody could have.
*  It rewards. It just rewards you.
*  It rewards your time and effort.
*  So that's my favorite.
*  First thing in the morning on a Saturday morning.
*  And when is it you prefer to see the movie alone?
*  No companion, no partner, just you.
*  You mean which movies do I prefer to see that way?
*  Yes. So sometimes a sad movie I might prefer to see alone.
*  Like what if the other person doesn't find it sad?
*  It's a bit of a discord.
*  I love. Yeah, I would say I'm lucky in that Amy is a great movie going partner because
*  she's also a filmmaker and we we tend to if we don't receive them exactly the same way.
*  And David Levine, my creative partner, same thing.
*  But I love seeing movies alone.
*  I would say and I love seeing a movie for the second time alone.
*  That's I would. The answer is really when I when I go see something for the second time,
*  like the master PTA's movie, the master.
*  And then the other thing I love to do is that better the second time.
*  Tell tell us that first.
*  So being alone the second time, because the first time you're you're swept up in the film,
*  you're swept up and everything.
*  You're with somebody.
*  You're like, can you believe this moment?
*  Look at that shot of him going across the salt flats.
*  Oh, look at the look on Philip Seymour Hoffman's face in this moment.
*  You're but you're kind of like in it together.
*  And then the next time when I'm alone, I think I'm able to be I've seen it.
*  So it's not about just being swept away.
*  And it's not about being analytic, but analytical.
*  But it is about allowing myself in a very private way to notice things and then take
*  my time noticing them and thinking about them, thinking about them as it's going.
*  I know what the story is.
*  I saw it the night before.
*  And so there's something about the solitude of a second time.
*  Eat to Mama Tambien.
*  I remember seeing a second time.
*  And because I had a question in my head, OK, how did he get to this?
*  The voiceover is kind of reminiscent of the way Melville would sometimes do voiceover,
*  like in Bob LeFlembour or something.
*  And so you're like, OK, what is this?
*  How did he decide that that's the approach he's taking?
*  Why?
*  How is this used so well?
*  Why does this movie both feel so intimate in first person and yet have this omniscience?
*  And like I had some questions.
*  And so the second time I could like alone kind of allow those questions to wash over
*  me and try to see if I came up with answers to them.
*  Why are so many movies today too long?
*  And yours are not.
*  I'm very happy to say.
*  But how did that happen?
*  Well, I'll get to that.
*  But I want to say one other thing about the other thing I love is like
*  I remember the first time I saw She's Got a Habit.
*  And I didn't know who Spike Lee was.
*  Nor did I.
*  It blew me away.
*  Right.
*  It changed.
*  So I was thinking about movies that really like changed me.
*  And that was a movie that changed me.
*  And I remember going to see it.
*  And in Boston, I was a sophomore in college.
*  And I went, oh, I didn't say in Boston because I went to Harvard.
*  I did not.
*  I went to Tufts.
*  So don't think I'm trying to be smart and subtly say that I didn't.
*  But the Harvard people say Cambridge, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And sometimes they say, sometimes they say New England.
*  I went to a small.
*  But so I remember going to see it.
*  And all I wanted to do was bring people to it.
*  And I went back.
*  So I saw it.
*  Right.
*  And then when he reveals that it's him at the end, because you're watching it,
*  you don't know he's Mars Blackman because it was so early in the thing.
*  He wasn't famous yet.
*  I remember the theater.
*  I saw it on everything.
*  And all the next I went back.
*  I went three days in a row to see that movie and I brought groups of people.
*  And that is I love that with all forms of art.
*  I love when you stumble upon something that has the thing about it.
*  That reminds you like for me, I wasn't yet somebody who was doing this.
*  I wasn't a filmmaker.
*  I didn't even know I could be a filmmaker.
*  I didn't know I could be a writer.
*  But there was something about the way Spike Lee used language and he used cinema.
*  That blew my mind.
*  And I had to share it with people.
*  And so that's the app.
*  It's in a way, it's a very personal experience.
*  But I wanted it to become communal.
*  And that's like the gift of the movies.
*  I wanted to.
*  And I remember bringing groups of people both nights.
*  So I could say I saw it Friday.
*  Then I saw it Saturday night.
*  And I saw it Sunday matinee.
*  And sharing it like that, Tyler was, I felt it was like this is why there are movies.
*  This is why this art form is so fantastic.
*  Because I remember experiencing it with those people and loving it just as much
*  all three times that I saw it.
*  And movies being too long.
*  What happened there?
*  Or are they not too long?
*  I don't know.
*  My friends say they're too long.
*  I've never heard someone say, oh, I want more movies that are two hours, 49 minutes.
*  Yeah, I mean, is Citizen Kane too long?
*  No, but that's Citizen Kane, right?
*  Is Casablanca too long?
*  No, that's Casablanca.
*  Is the third man too long?
*  There are so many movies.
*  That's like the 13th best movie that came out this year.
*  And it's almost three hours.
*  And those are too long.
*  I mean, it just depends on like, look, that's the thing where for a long time,
*  people would slam an artist for making a double album.
*  And yeah, a lot of double albums.
*  There's like a lot of fat.
*  But when I listen to The River, and then I listen to what would have been the single album of
*  The River.
*  The double's better.
*  The double's better.
*  I love certain of the songs on Be True is great.
*  And I wish that was on the bigger record.
*  But the bigger record's there for a reason.
*  And so for me, look, I'm somebody who wants the artists.
*  I love Tarantino's movies, and I want his movies to be long.
*  I'm happy to sit there and see the full exorcism of him fully exercising his vision.
*  And I don't really think that the studios let people, most people make movies that are just
*  too long.
*  I remember once, I don't know Wes Anderson.
*  I don't know him, but I met him once.
*  And I love his movies.
*  And I love that his movies are 90 minutes.
*  And I asked him once, the one time I met him, we were screening a film.
*  He invited some people who happened to be in town who he knew were film people.
*  And so I got to watch a movie with him.
*  And afterwards, we were just talking about movies.
*  And I said, these movies of yours, they're 90 minutes.
*  And he said, yeah.
*  I found that the things, the concepts I'm interested in don't really support a journey
*  that lasts longer than that.
*  And he's an incredibly disciplined filmmaker.
*  And so I was like, that makes total sense.
*  But can you imagine telling P.T.?
*  Now, let's say Magnolia.
*  Perhaps some people find aspects of Magnolia to be really about a filmmaker working some
*  stuff out for the filmmakers purposes.
*  But there are other people who find those parts of the movie incredibly satisfying.
*  And I think when somebody is a masterful artist like P.T.A.,
*  let's give them the room to do that.
*  But I'm also someone who doesn't like baseball games being shortened.
*  And I don't like pulling pitchers who are pitching a perfect game in the eighth
*  because the pitch count.
*  So I'm a bit of a romantic when it comes to this stuff.
*  And so I'm indulgent of the wishes of both filmmakers and pitchers.
*  Steve Snell speaking of Magnolia, what has happened to what you might call old school movie stars?
*  So this is 2023.
*  There are major films with Harrison Ford at 80 and Tom Cruise at whatever age in the lead roles.
*  Good for them, almost for that.
*  But why is there no next generation of very top movie stars?
*  Well, let's see if Margot Robbie is that.
*  Why isn't she?
*  She very well may be.
*  If you look at how she's built her career, it's very possible that she will be.
*  But who's the next Harrison Ford?
*  It's a big gap, right?
*  30 years and it's not clear who you would put in that same post.
*  Well, how old should I'm not asking it rhetorically.
*  Like how in your mind, how old should that person be now?
*  Like what?
*  What?
*  Where?
*  What?
*  Where on the continuum?
*  53.
*  And they've been doing it for 16 years and have three or four excellent movies under their belt.
*  Perhaps Bradley Cooper.
*  Let's see what happens with the Bernstein film because perhaps Bradley Cooper is that person.
*  Perhaps Matt Damon is that person.
*  It's a difficult question because you're really asking, I think, about what happened to the movie
*  industry.
*  And let's say also, let's adjust.
*  I'll do a little bit of like, let's adjust.
*  So life expectancy and how long one can do this.
*  So is Tom Cruise at 60, Harrison Ford at 53?
*  And if so, is Tom Cruise that person?
*  And also, of course, there's the question of mystery and all that stuff, right?
*  We didn't know anything about Jack or we knew funny things about Jack or Pacino.
*  Also, those guys are still doing it.
*  Those people are still making movies and that's another...
*  Bogie died.
*  The generation before those guys just died.
*  William Holden and Bogie, they died off and it kind of created room.
*  But as you say, you still have Harrison doing this stuff.
*  I'm sure that you, as is the case with myself, you know many very smart people who just don't
*  understand movies very well.
*  Like if you showed them Tarkovsky's Solaris, they'd be bored no matter how big the screen.
*  If you had to explain in as few dimensions as possible, what differentiates the really
*  smart people who get movies from the really smart people who do not get movies?
*  What's going on there?
*  Perhaps openness.
*  Perhaps the ability to not have to analyze in real time.
*  And to experience.
*  And perhaps it's a gateway thing.
*  I find Casablanca is a remarkable tool to solve this problem because
*  Kane is slow and Citizen Kane is slow and Citizen Kane
*  is very much a masterpiece with a capital M.
*  Casablanca sneaks up on you.
*  Casablanca is just fun.
*  It's fun from moment one.
*  Citizen Kane is portentous, not pretentious, but portentous.
*  From the moment it starts, you understand you're supposed to take something very seriously.
*  It's in everything that Wells does.
*  Casablanca is a delight.
*  And I find that I have found that no one, I have never met anyone immune to Casablanca.
*  And so it's a gateway into understanding what makes great cinema.
*  Now a lot of people are resistant to sitting down and turning it on or sitting down and watching it.
*  But if you get someone to watch 10 minutes of Casablanca and 10 minutes and you go,
*  hey, all right, cool, you tried, let's go.
*  They're like, no, no, no, what happens?
*  And then you got them.
*  And so I do find it to be an incredible thing to kind of hook people.
*  I think All the President's Men is another great example of a film that does that.
*  Because right away you are in this mystery and it doesn't announce itself as like proper cinema,
*  but it is proper cinema and it deploys all the tools of proper cinema.
*  And it's another kind of gateway film, as is Raiders, the first one.
*  So I think that the answer is, and then I guess, you know,
*  I guess there are some people who can stand in front of a painting.
*  And it just doesn't move them.
*  And then maybe they think, oh, I don't like paintings.
*  And maybe they don't like Caravaggio, but maybe they like Jasper Johns.
*  But they don't know that they like Jasper Johns because they would never go look at a Jasper Johns.
*  Or, you know, they don't like Jasper Johns, but suddenly they see something else that
*  speaks to them.
*  I mean, poetry functions the same way, right, Tyler?
*  Like, why are people immune to poetry and other people?
*  It just speaks to them.
*  But I see a kind of clumped distribution when it comes to cinema and Americans.
*  Almost everyone I know quite likes Casablanca, but they draw a line somewhere,
*  just as people will draw a line maybe with modern art or abstract art,
*  and they won't love Fellini or Bergman or whatever else you want to put on that list.
*  And who crosses that line and who doesn't?
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  Well, OK, is it like this, though?
*  Like, I don't understand atonal, you know,
*  I don't understand atonal composition.
*  I don't enjoy atonal composition.
*  I understand what it is as an exercise, but as a listener, I'm not, I don't want to put in what I
*  would have to put in to get out of it what some of my friends perhaps get out of it, right?
*  And so it's like Bergman.
*  I mean, I once was talking, I was once talking to an author who I admire a great deal, Mark Halperin.
*  And Mark said, Mark Halperin wrote A Soldier of the Great War and Winter's Tale,
*  not the political journalists, so they're different people, not Halperin, but Halperin.
*  And he talked about the cost, the emotional cost of reading novels after 50.
*  And that the way a novel can stir you up, because the best novels are about death,
*  essentially, whether they are, they aren't, they are, right?
*  And so the best movies, Bergman, is about death.
*  Bergman is about impermanence, right?
*  And so all the great works of art in some way or another are about impermanence.
*  And people often don't want to deal with impermanence.
*  And so you have to kind of decide how you're going to deal with that when engaging with art.
*  Because when art can affect you that deeply in a way that it makes you think about impermanence,
*  maybe you don't consider that a good time.
*  Maybe you can watch Michael Mann, a cinematic master, make Heat, because although there's death in it,
*  it's not really about death.
*  It's about consequences, and that's entirely different.
*  It's about consequences, and that's entirely different.
*  The other stuff's about impermanence, regardless of deserve, regardless of consequence.
*  And so I think that that might, perhaps that gets to, in some way, gets to the answer to that.
*  Speaking of death, what's your favorite Hitchcock movie?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's funny.
*  I was watching him talk yesterday about the use of staircase imagery in films.
*  It's a very boring answer, but North by Northwest.
*  I watched it pretty recently and was just blown away by it.
*  I would say the coldness of Hitchcock and his style of directing performance.
*  He's a master, he's the greatest, but it's not my personal favorite.
*  There's a difference between what we understand and can fully appreciate and what we just love,
*  and I'm not just someone in love with his movies.
*  Are Jerry Lewis movies funny?
*  Sometimes, yeah.
*  Sometimes they are.
*  I mean, he as a human character, obviously he's a complicated figure, but I don't go back
*  to his movies very often.
*  Why does comedy seem to stand the test of time less well than drama?
*  So if I watch silent movies that are supposed to be funny,
*  there's some chaplain that it quite speaks to me, but for the most part,
*  I just think this isn't funny.
*  A lot of movies from the 1950s, to me they're just flat out not funny,
*  bringing a baby I enjoy, but very few early comedies.
*  What's happening there?
*  And they don't cross borders as well either, as you know.
*  Well, I think, you know, so a couple answers to that.
*  Comedy clearly is of its time, because that applies to stand-up comedy too.
*  People our age, there's literally nothing in the world that seemed funnier than the
*  first two Steve Martin albums.
*  You could try those albums on some younger people, because the world took a lot of what he did.
*  No part of what he did seems stunning or surprising now.
*  But on the other hand, man, maybe it's just about like truly great stuff is what lasts, because
*  Thin Man is still as entertaining.
*  Have I put on Thin Man today?
*  I agree, even after the Thin Man, yeah.
*  Right, the first two, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You watch the first two, those movies are so fucking funny and endearing and charming
*  and just amazing.
*  And maybe it's just that they were great and the other stuff wasn't great.
*  But I've done the test, as I wonder if you have with, I've done the test with,
*  like, because it's a long time now from when Eddie Murphy and Bill Murray were in their
*  prime making those movies back then.
*  Those movies, and it's 40, 50 years later, 40 years later, certainly, they still really
*  work.
*  Stripes is still very, very funny and Trading Places is still very funny.
*  I agree.
*  So, you know, those things can last.
*  But Thin Man, okay, that's another movie that I would say to people, like,
*  if you think you don't like old movies, watch Thin Man.
*  What's the Steven Spielberg movie that you feel is quite deep in some underappreciated way,
*  if you had to pick one?
*  I'm a, yeah, I mean, I'm somebody who, I don't join the people who condemn Spielberg for
*  being populist, and I loved the movie about him that came out last year.
*  I mean, I just loved it.
*  Couldn't have loved it more.
*  His, you know, film as memoir.
*  I agree.
*  Yeah.
*  I loved it.
*  And some people really didn't like it.
*  And I just have to say, I was my favorite movie of the year.
*  I mean, I just loved it so much.
*  Well, I think Close Encounters is a great movie.
*  You know, it's about alienation, right?
*  And I think it's a great film.
*  And E.T. is a great film.
*  And I think either of those serves as a pretty good, I think Close Encounters is probably
*  the one that's quite deep, even if on the surface, it doesn't seem that way.
*  Which is the more recombi book that is especially deep and not sufficiently appreciated.
*  I'm glad you asked.
*  I saw that somebody wondered about Murakami.
*  I'm glad you asked the question.
*  For me, it's hard boiled Wonderland, but I love that would have been my number two choice.
*  I was thinking about it.
*  Well, I think Kafka on the Shore is like an astonishing.
*  So to me, Kafka on the Shore is.
*  It works so well, and it shouldn't work.
*  It doesn't it encompasses the entire experience of.
*  Life and love and war, it just encompasses.
*  It just encompasses so much and.
*  Every page is entertaining.
*  The thing about Haruki Murakami to me and why I think he's the living writer that.
*  Captures my imagination the most is that.
*  He never forgets the reader.
*  He's completely consumed with the personal.
*  He's completely consumed with making these things live for himself.
*  And to be fully personal expressions of how he feels and sees the world.
*  Yet his incredible magical mysterious gift is that he makes every page entertaining for you, the reader.
*  The reader and he's so I've read every single Murakami book more than once, except I've held out to to read for when he's no longer producing books.
*  And because I want to have two that I can read later that I've never read, but I find him a Marvel, a miraculous Marvel and I'm.
*  I'll never forget reading Norwegian Wood for the first time.
*  And and just.
*  Understanding that there was somebody out there.
*  Working at the highest possible level that you could work at as a as a writer.
*  What's your favorite book about poker and why I know you've bought hundreds of them.
*  I have.
*  There's a little known book.
*  So the books about poker that are the nonfiction, but you know Alvarez's book.
*  Is is perfect. It's a perfect book. I highly recommend it.
*  Anthony Holden's book is really entertaining. Peter Olsen's book about the world series of poker. There are many, many great poker. I'm leaving so many out.
*  There's a tiny little book called King of a Small World by Rick Bennett. I don't even know if it's in print.
*  It's like 210 pages and it's about Maryland poker games and I've read that book.
*  10 times it is a perfect encapsulation of a certain kind of poker life that existed.
*  A while back and I'm leaving books out and I'm sorry, but I do have one of the biggest poker book collections.
*  I've been collecting poker books for 35 years. Um, how's Maryland poker different?
*  Well back then they were at these though those games were at these like fire stations. They had to be under fake charities.
*  It's this whole kind of Byzantine set of rules that allowed these couple hustlers to live in it.
*  And it's I never got to play in that scene and I'm glad because I would have been fleeced.
*  But this guy creates these incredible characters. It's really he really this guy wrote
*  a really special book. Oh, but if I have to just mention, um,
*  because it's not something maybe um,
*  if the other writer who I think is the best writer in the world and he also dabbles in magic realism
*  and he wrote for me the best book ever about a person who's in the world of gambling
*  and that is William Kennedy's
*  Billy Phelan's greatest game.
*  Uh, if I have you ever read that book? No, we've already
*  Tyler it's as good as uh, Kennedy to me is like, you know, another one of these people like
*  Kennedy I think should have won the Nobel. I think that that all mini cycle is
*  a stunning achievement. Um, and I think that Billy Phelan's greatest game is his best book and
*  It's about everything that's been about gambling since I think in some way
*  That this book is kind of like in this same way that um,
*  David Morris the big con is where every single
*  con artist movie came from Billy Phelan's greatest game is like an urtext of sorts and I I highly recommend it
*  What would be something you feel you've learned about the poker universe?
*  That a well-educated american is likely to simply not understand or not know about it
*  That would be surprising and non-obvious. It's very well, this is basic, but it's not obvious to most people which is
*  You probably can't win
*  When you say probably where does the probably come from why not just you can't win
*  Like you may be one of those gifted freaks who can sit down and suddenly the math
*  Makes sense and reading people make sense. But basically if you don't study
*  Basically, if you don't study
*  And think about poker
*  I think about poker at least a little bit every day like I think about poker every day
*  And I am not a world-class poker player. I'm somebody who I track my results very closely
*  and
*  um, i'm flat like uh by the end of the i'm usually flat and I play a lot of poker
*  And being flat is a gigantic victory some years. I win a little bit and some years
*  I lose a little bit but basically
*  In competitive difficult poker games. I'm flat. I think about poker
*  At least
*  I engage in some way with materials about how to be better at poker
*  every day and um
*  That's where it's like chess. It's like required. I think and people so in your home game. Oh, okay
*  I can tell you in your home game
*  That's your casual monday night game
*  If you have a rotating group of 12 people to make your nine or seven who show up
*  What you don't know is that at least two of those people?
*  Actually are taking it almost as seriously as a job
*  That's the thing that most people don't know
*  What's your greatest weakness as a poker player?
*  I think you'll understand that i'd rather not say
*  Jalen brunson overrated or underrated underrated
*  Let's go. He's properly rated now. That's what I think he was underrated
*  It's one of the only times the nicks got an asset. I think it's one of the only times the nicks got an asset
*  um
*  Below what should have been the market price for that asset and I I love him
*  and um, I think he is
*  He he over delivered which like has never happened hasn't happened since bernard king probably and for the nicks where someone just um
*  Over delivered show. Hey otani though underrated
*  And are the nicks going to get joel imbied the cove's theorem says they should right?
*  So you think that he he he is going to force a trade he's going to force a trade of some sort
*  Well, this is august of 2023 but it seems to me at this time not impossible that harden leaves philly and imbied wants out
*  I got that many teams can actually attract him and the nicks are one of those
*  Tell me if i'm wrong
*  Well, new york market, right?
*  Right. Yeah, but what pieces would we if he forces a trade meaning if it's not when he's free agent
*  As many draft picks as the cba will allow yeah, but darrell's gonna want brunson so it's uh, darrell's gonna
*  You can't do that and you can't do that and or and and
*  so
*  It's a I would like let me just say this
*  And darrell if you're listening, he's my friend friends with darrell as I know, you know him too darrell if you're listening
*  Um, I think it'd be a great idea. Just take some draft picks and give us jolin bead. I think it solves all your problems
*  What is it? You really think of new jersey anyway?
*  I uh
*  I loved fred armisen's version of david patterson when he would just say new jersey with so much contempt
*  My wife's from new jersey. So the one thing I will say is uh
*  I'm from long island originally and she's from new jersey and I
*  Always figured no matter what I would marry someone where they would be able to use as a kind of trump card on me
*  Well, what do you know? You're from long island, but at least she's from jersey
*  Let's say i'm in manhattan and i'm looking for good food
*  What is it you think that you might know that I do not being a northern virginian?
*  But ultimately from new jersey
*  Well david chang is a virginian so he certainly figured it out and uh,
*  I think you should look at the places he recommends in virginia and just go to those places, but I would say
*  um
*  Yeah, a lifetime of being in this city and eating in this city. I think i've uh developed relationships with chefs
*  and so
*  I might know where chefs are eating
*  and that might give me some
*  insight also like um just knowing where
*  Some younger people who aren't able to spend a lot of money or finding
*  great food is a valuable thing to know in the city because someone's always opening an amazing spot and
*  um, you know, there are people here who really want to find out what that spot is before
*  It becomes impossible to get into and so you just kind of learn to have an instinct for that. But also
*  Where like the place that's not hip or cool is i'd say I really do know that
*  I know the place that like if you want to go to great diner go to joji's and don't worry about where
*  The internet is telling you to go if you want to get a great steak a poivre
*  Just go to lucien which was really hip 20 years ago, but isn't hip now
*  And so those kinds of things which is like I could take you to 25 uncool places places that are not hip and not cool
*  where we could just have something perfectly prepared and
*  Delicious and you would leave really happy and there would be nothing about it that felt like you were a part of a scene
*  And maybe that's something that only someone who lives here could put together
*  And what's the part of town that is most ripe for further exploration in these directions?
*  You know like i'm in the upper west side it can be tough going I feel there aren't that many good places
*  I mean, what's what's wrong with you people?
*  If i'm in the east village i'll do better
*  But it's sort of everyone feels that way now and then I start thinking well, there's some trick here
*  This isn't going to last well the upper west side does now have new york's best restaurant in tatiana, but um
*  Other than that you're totally right. The upper west side's been a wasteland
*  for food
*  Because family, you know
*  There's practical reasons because that's a neighborhood people move to to raise kids and they're not going to eat as much they're they're at home
*  They're that's just you know, whereas the west village, you know, or the lower east side or like midtown like midtown east
*  you know
*  Or over in koreatown. There's just so much great stuff. That's kind of unexplored
*  Let's say you could spend three days out of retreat
*  And you get to choose two or three other people who will show up and talk with you for those three days
*  Now people in cinema, you can already do that, right? Maybe some other people too
*  Living people who are the two or three people you would choose?
*  Well, well can these be friends of mine or you don't want them to know you can already do your friends, right?
*  So no, I can't I can't say Seth Godin even though I would say Seth Godin. Um
*  Oh, I well more haruki murakami, that would be great. I would uh, even though i'm not someone who has cats I would supply them if uh,
*  he
*  wanted
*  to be there
*  I I will tell you I would love to be able to talk to donald hoffman for a few days
*  Because it would take a few days for him to be able to find
*  Where I could understand him well enough that we could really communicate but I would want to take that time to really understand
*  his
*  Theory about what reality is like I feel that would be an incredibly useful
*  thing to be able to sit with him and and
*  Get the building blocks so that I could begin to understand
*  where
*  Where he is?
*  And then I think you have to say bob dylan because if you were able to be in a spot where dylan was
*  And if bob assuming for this game that bob was interested in sharing, uh, not necessarily you wouldn't have to share
*  Autobiographical details we could all assume that like, you know you i've read all of I know all the sort of things but
*  If if I assume that dylan is perhaps the wisest person
*  He must be the smartest person. He's an accident of nature and it's like let's say the smartest human walking around
*  I would want to understand what it is that he understands
*  In a way that if if if there are a way he could explain that to me
*  Well, you have a career dylan has a career. What do you think you can learn from his career?
*  Well
*  I said this to paul schrader on the podcast on my podcast once, you know, it's a great
*  I don't know bob dylan's
*  ability
*  Like for instance, you know, he said that he wrote the kennedy song he's like on those there was some interview he gave where he's like
*  Yeah, I wrote this song
*  you know
*  He said something about like where in temporal where in time he wrote it that was just not true because
*  He didn't want to talk about the fact of when he'd actually come up with it
*  Which was recently to comment about the world we were really living in like I think he told some story about writing it
*  Seven years ago or something like that. I think he's great at taking pressure off himself throughout his career from any externality
*  And I think the clue is what he said when he won that award when he said, you know, you can um
*  My father said to me that a man can debase himself so much that even his own family will turn his back on them
*  But god never will and I tie that to the thing
*  He wrote in in the book of lyrics about that poem
*  he wrote about what he not song for woody but that poem he wrote about woody when he talks about going to the hospital to visit woody
*  and uh woody guthrie for those who don't I know, you know, but just people don't know when he goes to the hospital to visit woody
*  and woody let him clean his bedpans and stuff because
*  Woody wanted to show bob that no man should be a hero to another man that he was just a person and he produced this work
*  Because of what he was willing to do to himself to produce this work
*  And I think there's something about that moment and bob saying the thing about debasing himself and all the shit
*  He made up in chronicles that
*  That the lesson is that none of the externalities matter
*  Yes, bob wanted success and it's always confusing with bob because he's a multi-headed hydra and all that stuff, but
*  at core
*  He's this writer who always found a way to hear only his own voice
*  And to have the confidence and comfort to then serve and produce that that voice
*  only for those people who were willing
*  to
*  Try to hear it
*  And I think as a as any kind of an artist
*  That's almost impossible to do you tell yourself you can but it's very difficult to do it because there's
*  All sorts of other considerations that come into play and it seems to me that only
*  Dylan and miles and like chuck berry were able and willing to do that
*  Bruce had john landau
*  But bob really, you know who he could bounce this stuff off to kind of make a third thing out of it
*  Whereas it seems to me i'm like rem did that for five years, but but bob has done that for 60 years, right?
*  So it's it's crazy
*  I mean, do you think that the read I have of dylan and what he does is does it does it line up with your read?
*  Absolutely study the past is another career lesson from dylan. I think
*  And just keep on going
*  Be willing to reinvent yourself
*  and
*  Choose your audiences wisely
*  The ones you care about yes, but be willing to reinvent yourself
*  Not in the david but david bowie's a great artist too, but a different kind of artist not to me anyway not reinvent yourself
*  To fit the times but be willing to reinvent yourself
*  Because it's what your inner voice is telling you you need to do to stay an artist, right? I think is what he's doing. Yes
*  last few questions
*  How happy are people in the movie business?
*  When the strikes over thrilled
*  But in general as the people
*  It's this long-standing cliche someone wants to be a movie star want to be a director at the end of that pot of gold
*  Are people happier than average less happy?
*  Vichy anand I interviewed him two weeks ago. He said he thinks the top chess players are really happy
*  Would you say the same about your line of work?
*  When engaged in the work so
*  on set
*  Doing the work. That's the time that people are really yes taking flight
*  The rest of it I think for people at times can be hard
*  because of
*  a series of of pressures and things there are some people who seem to be able to be
*  Happy, but I don't know that it draws happy people to it. I don't know that that if you're happy
*  You feel like this is the form of expression that you need to engage in but I do think on
*  In in the making of something that you care about. I think that's where there's a lot of joy
*  At the meta level, what did you learn from your dad? Obviously very particular things but viewed largely
*  It's an enormous question and he only died seven months ago, so it's a hard
*  Question. It's obviously a question. I've been thinking about the answer to a lot. I would say
*  There are the basic things of like loyalty which I mean, um, but I would suggest I thought a lot about
*  My dad was somebody
*  Who never felt
*  Intimidated to have any conversation with anybody and
*  This idea
*  That no one is better than anyone else
*  Was important to him even if it might not have seemed like that that is he had a really egalitarian idea about
*  people's capacity and that
*  You had to keep your eyes open because greatness could show up
*  at any given moment and
*  That is something i've carried with me
*  I think he probably wouldn't have expressed his curiosity in the way I express my curiosity
*  But he had a similar kind of curiosity and appreciation for greatness
*  And I think that I chase greatness in the same way that that he did
*  At the meta level, what did you learn from your mom?
*  How to love people with your whole heart and not hold back
*  Is there an unrealized dream or project you have again current conditions aside but that somehow the world won't let you make it
*  I
*  Mean, yeah, we always wanted to make billy phalan's greatest game and it's set in albany in like 1910
*  And it's really very difficult kind of a thing just if you could man
*  It's got magic realism in it
*  But if you could somehow that i'll tell you there are two things and the other thing is
*  American tabloid which is one of the greatest things ever written about that what's at the heart of a certain kind of america
*  James elroy's american tabloid clearly to me is best the book that's gonna
*  live on of his and um, I mean black dahlia can too seem to be really confidential but
*  But for me american tabloid was this guy at the moment in his life as an artist
*  When he was kind of firing in all cylinders, but before what he did
*  Before even to himself they became tropes is the wrong word. It's I don't mean negatively but
*  He hadn't fallen into a groove yet. Even the cold 6000
*  even cold 6000 is like
*  Almost like in reaction to american tabloid whereas american tabloid
*  Is its own thing and to me what's at the heart of american tabloid could just be the most
*  staggering and crushing
*  Television series and it's been very hard to try to
*  To do that
*  And that would be an amazing thing to be able to do
*  I can see the problem with albany in 1910, but american tabloid sounds commercially viable to me at some point
*  Yeah, people have owned it and it's just challenging to it's just challenging to put together
*  Final question. What is the next thing you will set your mind to learning about?
*  I am
*  I really want to learn about um, I want to take my knowledge of opera up, uh a huge um amount
*  So opera would be one thing
*  Uh because I didn't like it till I was like 52 years old and I really like it now
*  But only some and I don't understand why yet
*  I don't know
*  I have no idea why I put on one piece and I love it and I put on another and I don't
*  Dig it at all and i'm kind of curious about that. So that's like a simple little one
*  um, and then the
*  The bigger one for me is related to um
*  Uh physical fitness and working out i've been uh, working out a lot and
*  I kind of want to see if I can return myself at 60 to like i'm 57 by 60 if I can somehow
*  Uh turn myself back to the basketball player. I was at 30
*  If you send me your korean movie recommendations, i'll send you my opera brian compliment. Thank you very much
*  Thanks tyler. This is great
