# Paul Romer on a Culture of Science and Working Hard  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [May 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5cScmgJdSg)
*  Hello, everyone.
*  Today I am chatting once again with Paul Romer, who needs no introduction.
*  Paul, welcome.
*  Good to be here.
*  You have a recent article in the periodical Foreign Affairs about the failings of economics.
*  Let me try to defend the economics profession.
*  Tell me what you think.
*  If I look at the big catch-up winners over the last few decades, it seems to me it's
*  Poland and Ireland.
*  And they basically followed in a neoliberal recipe.
*  They more or less did what economists told them to do.
*  What's the failure in that?
*  Yeah.
*  So, by the way, what about China?
*  I mean, China caught up pretty well, too.
*  But they followed some of the basic insights from economics.
*  And the solar model.
*  Sorry?
*  The solar model, plus a lot of scale, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So the origins of that article were that I read some books that said economists got
*  a lot more influence and things got worse in the United States.
*  And this was a really troubling argument for me because it's not easy to dismiss.
*  What I concluded in that article is saying we should do a cost-benefit analysis.
*  Look at the big things that economics has done well, the things it may have done badly,
*  and just see how it works out.
*  The point you're alluding to is something that my colleague, Peter Henry, has also made,
*  which is that one of the areas where economics may really have been helpful is in the development
*  process or the catch-up phase of growth.
*  So that should go on the plus side, I think, on the benefit side on the cost-benefit analysis.
*  No question there.
*  And there I think there's some other ones that belong there, too.
*  My point was that there may have been some things that have also been significant negatives,
*  and it's time to do the numbers and see what the net is.
*  So if I ask myself, what do I think has been the biggest negative?
*  I suppose I would say around 2008, economists, for the most part, did not understand the
*  importance of the shadow banking system.
*  So what seemed to be a kind of ordinary real estate bubble like the early 1990s was far,
*  far worse, and we totally missed that.
*  That seems to be a defect of institutional knowledge.
*  You tell me what you think the greatest problem has been.
*  I think this problem is an interesting one.
*  I put a slightly different spin on it, but I think it's in the class of things of a failure
*  to understand.
*  And I don't think that's necessarily incomplete understanding.
*  I don't think that's a sign of a science that's failed.
*  That's a sign of a science which is just making progress.
*  There's some things it knows, things it doesn't know.
*  And so I don't view this one as a sign of a systemic problem that we're not doing it
*  right in a sense.
*  For what it's worth, we can come back and talk about this, but I think the lesson from
*  the financial crisis, which we're learning again now, is one about the fragility of extensive
*  interconnection.
*  And so we've paid attention to optimize efficiency with massive reliance on specialization and
*  these kind of complicated supply chains.
*  But the growth, the proliferation of connection means that our system is more fragile than
*  we realize.
*  So a shock comes and things happen that we didn't anticipate.
*  But again, that's part of learning about a very new type of economy which is changing
*  in real time.
*  The ones that struck me as being particularly worrisome were first, I think, the negative
*  effect that economists have had in terms of protecting competition.
*  Through the law and economics movement, we ratified this notion that big is okay as long
*  as you can make some case that it's efficient.
*  And the upshot is that I think because of technical economics and the arguments of economists,
*  what I trust is much more tolerant now of dominant firms.
*  And if we believe that competition is good in a whole bunch of ways, this could actually
*  be very, very harmful.
*  So that's one.
*  Doesn't Amazon look pretty good right now in the midst of the pandemic?
*  I mean, do you wish we had split it up into different parts?
*  Yeah, my sense is that we'd be better off if we had five Amazons instead of one.
*  And I don't see why we couldn't have five Amazons.
*  If we as voters say this is the kind of society we want to live in, let's just aim for that.
*  And same thing.
*  I think the more worrisome positions are those of the tech firms that are so deeply connected
*  now to many aspects of our lives and where there's really very little competition and
*  a lot of opacity about what these firms actually do.
*  Let me try to defend the economics profession a bit more.
*  If we look at climate policy, a lot of economists have recommended a carbon tax, not quite a
*  consensus but a very common view.
*  Now, of course, we haven't done it, but it seems to me the profession in some manner
*  is essentially correct there.
*  So you would side with the profession on that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And again, part of the main, in some sense, the main point of the article that I'm making
*  is that economists need to accept that our role is that of the technical advisor.
*  We can say if you apply a carbon tax, carbon emissions will go down.
*  Here's what other effects we think they'll have.
*  But it's up to you, the voters, to decide whether you want to follow that policy or
*  not.
*  So if the voters don't follow us, I think to a first approximation, that's not really
*  our responsibility.
*  What I'm critical of is this tendency for economists to assume the responsibility of
*  philosopher King and saying to voters, well, we know better what a society should be like,
*  what society should do.
*  Listen to us.
*  We'll tell you the way things should be.
*  We'll tell you what you should do.
*  And in truth, I think we get into that mode a lot more than we realize.
*  Certainly some members of the profession get into that mode.
*  And I think they've done really quite a bit of harm when they did that.
*  When you as a voter judge policies, what normative or philosophical standard do you use?
*  Well, I think all of us have some notions about self-interest and then well-being of
*  those around us, everything else equal.
*  If our position is the same, we're somewhat happier if those around us are happier as
*  well.
*  A lot of us have either a bigger or smaller circle of those we care about.
*  So there's some mixture of making sure everybody is doing okay and then making sure I'm doing
*  okay.
*  That's the first thing that I look at as a voter.
*  But I also look at, this is I think a little bit of a tangent relative to your question,
*  but I also look at kind of the question of what direction will this policy take our norms,
*  our beliefs about right and wrong.
*  I think those change.
*  I think there's some beliefs about right and wrong which are better in an objective sense,
*  in the sense that we economists think of in terms of efficiency.
*  If everybody thought this was the right thing to do, then we would actually all be better
*  off in some objective sense.
*  So those issues weigh heavily in my thinking about policies.
*  Economists have been a little slow to take those up, but I don't know that that's, I
*  mean, I think that's frankly, I guess that is a part of the problem, I think, with economic
*  analysis because much of the, many of the arguments about say like allowing the market
*  to run and giving people more freedom make more sense if when you do that, you don't
*  change norms.
*  But if when you do that, you encourage norms that are destructive, that kind of more laissez
*  faire approach can be harmful.
*  Let me take a trivial example.
*  Suppose laissez faire, the promulgation of laissez faire makes everybody feel like it's
*  okay to litter.
*  Okay.
*  So we used to have a norm that we shouldn't litter because it was inconsiderate and it
*  was just wrong.
*  Laissez faire convinces us, I can litter if I want to.
*  It's somebody else's problem to deal with the litter.
*  That kind of laissez faire would be bad because we'd live in a world that was like full of
*  trash all over the place.
*  And I think in more important areas, economists have been inattentive to the effects that
*  their policies have had on norms.
*  But if you take say litter, why wouldn't the economic approach be A, either create a private
*  property right, which we do sometimes.
*  Other times that's not possible.
*  So we want something like a Pagouvian tax or cap and trade.
*  And your view then is not really far from the standard economics view, if at all.
*  But I think there's actually enormous value in norms that are kind of self-enforcing.
*  So suppose people think litter is bad.
*  Suppose they think it's bad when other people litter.
*  So they'll kind of scold or criticize when they see somebody litter.
*  Then without police powers, without courts, without taxes, you actually get the outcome
*  we want, which is we live in a world with no litter.
*  And if we lost those norms, we got to overlay these more heavy, expensive kind of governmental
*  solutions.
*  Let's look at macroeconomics.
*  If I look at the current crisis, which is turning into a depression, it seems to me
*  we were on the verge of a financial implosion in March.
*  The Fed acted to limit that.
*  The macroeconomic response to me from the Fed seems to be quite good.
*  So isn't all well in macroeconomics?
*  Yeah.
*  When I was talking about this cost balance exercise, the cost benefit exercise, one of
*  the positives we mentioned was in the sphere of development and catch-up.
*  I think another is in stabilization policy.
*  The kind of practical macro policy as practiced at the Fed is much better now than it was
*  during the 1930s.
*  And we get real benefits from that.
*  So I think it's good that the Fed is trying to make sure that we don't have this cascade
*  of bankruptcies.
*  So there's no question that economists have learned something and contributed to society.
*  Just as a side note, I've been critical of the kind of the more theoretical, rational
*  expectations macro, but set that aside because that really hasn't had that much impact on
*  policy.
*  So macro policy as practiced at the Fed or as practiced by the Congress right now is,
*  I think, a reflection of things we've learned relative to, say, the 1930s.
*  And that's good.
*  But let me kind of come back to what are the minus sides of this balance sheet.
*  So I talked about antitrust and the failure of competition policy.
*  The other one is in regulation.
*  I think, and if you ask me, who's my representative of somebody, an economist who overstepped,
*  overreached and did real harm?
*  It's Alan Greenspan.
*  Greenspan was this tireless advocate for cutting regulation.
*  He was quoted at one point saying he's never met a regulation that he thought was valuable.
*  And he played a very important role in deregulating the financial system in the run up, you know,
*  for decades running up to the financial crisis.
*  That financial crisis cost us an enormous amount worldwide.
*  So it's because we unwound systems of regulation that kept our financial system from being
*  as fragile as it's become.
*  And I think you look across the board at other types of regulation, we've failed to support
*  the kinds of regulations that we need alongside of Pagouvian taxes.
*  There's some bad things that people do bad in the sense they're inefficient.
*  We can try and tax them.
*  Other times you just use regulation.
*  But one way or the other, we collectively want to stop people from doing things that
*  are harmful.
*  But if you look at the profession as a whole, wouldn't most economists agree that say tax
*  preferences for owner occupied housing are a bad idea and various other subsidies built
*  into the system for housing are a bad idea?
*  And if they had been listened to on that, well, we still might have had a crisis of
*  some kind, but it would have been far smaller.
*  Scott Sumner has argued if we had targeted nominal GDP, the crisis would have been milder.
*  So you're picking a bit on the one thing that Greenspan got wrong.
*  But there's many other things economists have said that would have made it much better.
*  Yeah, but we still should have been saying given the choices that voters are making,
*  which reflect your preferences as voters, like supporting owner occupied housing, the
*  regulatory choices that we are recommending as economists are actually exposing us to just
*  massive, massive harm.
*  And I don't remember the number off the top of my head, but Haldane did some calculation
*  where the worldwide cost of the financial crisis was, I think, in the hundreds of trillions
*  of dollars.
*  So this is a really huge, huge mistake.
*  So and we're still, I think, exposed to a financial system which could just blow up
*  on us at any point in time.
*  It's part of why the Fed has to be so active right now with providing funds.
*  So deregulation, especially of financial markets, I think was harmful.
*  And competition policy was a failure.
*  And then the bottom line is you just look at one of the most basic ways to measure
*  progress.
*  How long do people live?
*  People in the United States are not living as long as they used to.
*  Life expectancy is declining.
*  And life expectancy hasn't been keeping up with other nations around the world.
*  Sure, but is that a failure of economists?
*  Well, I think partly when the pharmaceutical firms that were trying to make money off of
*  OxyContin and these opiate-based painkillers, when they went to Congress to try and stop
*  the DEA from shutting them down, what they used was the language of economics.
*  You have to have innovation.
*  You got to let the market proceed.
*  There'll be some creative destruction, but you have to let us do our thing.
*  You can't interfere.
*  It'll be bad for growth.
*  And so to the extent that we lent cover indirectly for those kinds of arguments against
*  regulation so firms could make money killing people, we really did something bad.
*  But again, there are people out there who have misused your ideas or misrepresented them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Maybe they've done the same with mine.
*  I don't blame you at all for that, right?
*  So if something bad happens with the charter city, I don't say, oh, Paul Romer gave them
*  cover.
*  I say, no, it's the fault of the people who did it.
*  So I would say economists were pretty much not to blame for the opioid crisis.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, there's a speech Greenspan gave where he doesn't cite me, but he could.
*  It's all about, you know, we can't have regulation because we got to have growth.
*  Growth comes from innovation.
*  Regulation slows innovation.
*  It'll stop creative destruction.
*  We just have to live with creative destruction.
*  So I feel like some of my ideas could have been used to support bad policy.
*  But instead of like asking whether I'm personally to blame or personally a bad person,
*  what I'm stepping back and asking is, did we create a system but let someone like Greenspan
*  make recommendations under the cover of science?
*  Like, I'm a scientist.
*  I'm telling you how it should go.
*  But those recommendations were really based on kind of a worldview he got from a novel
*  by Ayn Rand, you know?
*  They were not, there was no technical scientific basis for them.
*  And they turned out to be really incredibly harmful.
*  So we need to make sure that this system that we're building isn't misused in that way.
*  Do you think there should be an obsession with math GRE scores when admitting people
*  into graduate programs in economics?
*  And we know there is, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's not the only problem.
*  Is that how we need to do it?
*  It's not the only thing I think we should be looking at.
*  And I'm not sure what are the other predictors.
*  But I don't think just kind of practice in math is going to lead to a successful career
*  in economics.
*  You've been interacting a lot with epidemiologists, too, in part,
*  in your arguments for testing.
*  What's your opinion of that field?
*  Well, you know, there's actually an interesting parallel in epidemiology
*  with a technical kind of issue in economics.
*  In macro, we shifted towards model-based reasoning about macroeconomics.
*  So representative agent, the whole Rational Expectations movement
*  was a kind of a shift towards, let's see what the models say rather than
*  let's see what the data says.
*  In epidemiology, there's a very well-established model, this SIR model
*  that is behind a lot of these predictions.
*  But there's an alternative that the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation,
*  which has this model that's been very influential, widely watched these days.
*  The IMHE is using a much more data-driven approach, kind of a curve-fitting approach.
*  It's almost like old-style Keynesian macro, where you just say,
*  well, let's just kind of fit something to the numbers and see what comes out of that
*  without imposing a lot of theory onto the estimation process.
*  And I just found it interesting to see that tension in another field.
*  From the outside, the way it looks to me is it's good to have both of those wings
*  active in a discipline, and it's good to have them kind of in contention with each other.
*  And if I have a criticism of macro in economics, it's like the criticism
*  in epidemiology, we may have biased things a little bit too much towards the models.
*  And we're not giving enough weight to just the facts themselves.
*  And I think that's because it's actually easier to do models than to look at data.
*  So we need to have a little bit of collective pressure to, yeah, yeah,
*  that's what your theory says, but let's look at the numbers.
*  Many people have supported mass testing plans.
*  Of course, you've been in the lead here.
*  Why do you think they're not getting more support?
*  Because the benefit-cost ratio, if you can pull it off, seems to be quite high.
*  Yeah, I've actually been working on it.
*  Mind you, I'm the theorist criticizing the use of models.
*  So go figure.
*  But what have I been doing recently?
*  I've been using a model to try and figure out what is actually the value of
*  additional tests relative to its cost.
*  So models definitely have their role, but
*  you gotta stick to the idea that a fact beats a theory every time.
*  Now, why aren't we, I think it's just very clear that a test is worth a lot more
*  than it would cost us to provide.
*  Why aren't we delivering more?
*  I think there's a genuine confusion and
*  puzzlement about how to increase the supply of tests.
*  And because people don't know how to go about increasing it,
*  they say it's not possible.
*  They treat it as if it's just something beyond our control.
*  I think we have to look carefully at what changes should we make in policy to
*  increase the supply of tests.
*  One part of that, as I've been saying, is we just have to pay for them.
*  We put up enough money, we can get tests.
*  So I've been saying, if we spent about twice as much on tests as we spend on
*  soda, we could have all the tests we need, like 23 million tests a day.
*  So first, you gotta provide money.
*  Because tests are a public good, this has gotta be money that comes from
*  the government.
*  It's hard to get there with having consumers pay.
*  But the Congress has allocated 25 billion.
*  There's a proposal now for another 75 billion from the Democratic plan.
*  So we're getting there on the money.
*  The other side, which frankly, I'm in this position,
*  think about what I was saying before.
*  I'm generally in the position of defending regulation.
*  The more I've looked at the role of the FDA in holding back progress and testing,
*  the more I've concluded this is a case where we have to say, as a kind of
*  I just often say, this regulation is just getting the cost benefit trade off wrong.
*  It's way too restrictive.
*  There's little harm from tests that, I mean, tests don't hurt people.
*  It's not like a vaccine or a pharmaceutical agent.
*  So the FDA is just needlessly slowing down innovation that could otherwise
*  flourish.
*  So pay some money and then get the FDA out of the way.
*  And then all of these very clever researchers and university labs all across this country,
*  they could give us all the tests we need.
*  Germany has done a great deal with testing, as you know.
*  But at least now, as we're speaking, as of I think May 12th, there are still over one.
*  Does that worry you?
*  Does testing really get you into the promised land if you're not a small island?
*  It does worry me.
*  And I don't think that as well as they've done, actually remember,
*  Let's just pause for a second, because this is a little tricky.
*  If R is equal to one, that means that the number of deaths,
*  the number of infections will stay constant over time.
*  So you can have R equal to one at a low level of infection and
*  low rate of deaths, which is where Germany is.
*  We have R about equal to one at a higher rate of death.
*  But in any case, it is worrisome because what we want for
*  suppression is R significantly less than one.
*  And Germany is not testing at the scale that I would propose.
*  And I'm afraid that the way to get there is that even Germany is going to have to
*  do more testing, including more testing where you're just kind of fishing for
*  people who are infected.
*  You just test people who are asymptomatic.
*  You've got no indication that they were in contact, but you test them anyway,
*  because that's the only way to find some of the people who are currently infected.
*  Do you worry that some of the countries that have done the best with testing
*  have combined it with forced quarantine, and
*  that maybe you need forced quarantine for testing to work?
*  Well, I think, again, I was critical.
*  It's been very funny to go from that kind of this angst almost like crisis of
*  the review I wrote of what economists have done.
*  But then to shift into economist mode where I think we can actually provide
*  some real benefit and some clarity in these conversations.
*  The way I frame this on testing is first ask what would be the value
*  of a particular piece of information.
*  Let's just, how valuable would it be if we know who's infected and who's not?
*  Then, given that information separately,
*  let's think about what's a good way to use that information.
*  And I think there's some open questions about how best to use this.
*  I have some colleagues who I've written a paper on because they were also
*  promoting this idea of test everyone.
*  Their view is that one of the ways we might do this is just at home,
*  get devices that can test you at home.
*  So everybody finds out if they're infected or not.
*  Their attitude is that may be all you need to do.
*  Because once people know they're infected, they'll take decisions,
*  take actions to protect their colleagues, the people they know.
*  Most people are responsible.
*  Most people don't want to inflict harm on others.
*  They may well just self isolate.
*  So maybe that with enough testing, we just let everybody know,
*  are you infectious or not?
*  And that's all we have to do.
*  You could go to the other extreme and have some government system where the test
*  system has to report every positive and the government forces quarantine on people.
*  I don't think you need that.
*  I don't think you get that much benefit out of that.
*  And it's got a lot of, I think, potential costs.
*  So let's get that information and then let's use it very gently.
*  First, just let people know and let them adjust.
*  Second, maybe give someone like, I keep talking about,
*  recovery means I can actually go back to the dentist.
*  So maybe my dentist will say, Paul, I don't want to be working in your mouth.
*  And you can't be wearing a mask when you're in the dental chair
*  unless you have a recent test that shows that you're not positive.
*  Then fine.
*  You can come on in and I can work on your teeth.
*  So we might give other people the right and the ability to say,
*  there are certain things you can't do, certain services you can't have access to
*  unless you can show that you've got a negative.
*  So restaurants might offer sit down meals, but say you can only get a reservation.
*  If you can show us you've got a negative test result in the last couple days.
*  So we can use this information in ways that I think aren't very oppressive,
*  aren't very risky.
*  They could let us go back to going to the dentist and having restaurant reels and
*  do it without big risks, I think, to our freedoms.
*  Take the people who test positive.
*  It seems that at some point they're likely to be immune and
*  in a sense they're more valuable as workers.
*  But when do we give them the clear?
*  So I read papers, you can be infectious for up to five weeks, maybe more.
*  We're in a very risk averse society.
*  Don't you run the risk by getting a test at all, that in essence you end up locked
*  out of polite society.
*  Well, again, this is where I'm defending science and economics as science.
*  Here is really the science of medicine.
*  We need to help everybody know here's what the facts are.
*  Based on these kind of signals or this elapsed time,
*  you can be confident that a person is not infectious any longer.
*  And then people may still have some emotional aversive reactions.
*  But I think if we can just credibly provide the facts,
*  then that will start to change practice.
*  And practice will start to change some of those deeper emotions.
*  Should there be a liability waiver for businesses that test their employees?
*  We all know there are false negatives and positives, in fact.
*  So say your business tests you, they tell you you don't have it.
*  It turns out you do have it.
*  You infect your spouse.
*  Should there be a liability waiver to encourage this testing?
*  For vaccines, we created a special compensation mechanism.
*  So that instead of litigating somebody who's harmed by taking a vaccine,
*  because there's a small fraction of the population that has a negative side effect.
*  There's a separate compensation mechanism.
*  I think there are many reasons to think that our judicial system
*  is an ineffective way to address a harm or to provide insurance.
*  And that it slows down many important things that we need to do.
*  But I'd be more in favor of a broader look at ways to improve
*  the functioning of the judicial system rather than just do a,
*  I mean, I don't have a strong view on this.
*  It may be that to move quickly,
*  we want to have a special patch related to what firms do with test information.
*  But I don't think we should stop there.
*  We really should be asking,
*  how can we tune the judicial system to make it work better?
*  But could it be that litigation is the ultimate reason why America is so
*  slow in testing, that any big push for anything?
*  Someone can raise their hand and object.
*  Someone could sue, well, this violates the Health Insurance Privacy Act.
*  I'm not even sure it does, but you would need a ruling.
*  Someone sues on disabilities regulation.
*  I need to have this app, I can't read it.
*  Someone sues about masks, well, I can't do lip reading.
*  The actual solution is something we're far from, and that's to clear away
*  all this emphasis on litigation in American policy.
*  And economists have been mostly right about that too, or not.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, so my kind of dive into testing has persuaded me that the FDA
*  is far more important as a force that's slowing down progress there.
*  There's been speculation about lawsuits, but
*  there's really little indication that those will materialize.
*  And the people I talked to who can't do things they wanna do in testing
*  are failing to do it because of the kind of concern about the FDA.
*  So I don't think the facts support litigation is the big threat here.
*  And also, in terms of moving quickly, one of the things we could leverage,
*  because this is a public good, is the sovereign immunity of the states.
*  I think the states can actually just purchase the test,
*  say with money they get from the feds.
*  And then even give instructions about here are ways to use these tests.
*  Those could even be regulations, is what you have to do.
*  If you're a restaurant, if your employees test negative, you can open.
*  You have legal permission to open.
*  And you have to require that people test negative.
*  But if you do, that's fine.
*  And if somebody who tests negative goes to restaurants and
*  other people get infected because of that, the restaurant could actually have
*  the protection of the mandate from the state that this is what you should do to
*  protect public health.
*  So I think the states could actually provide cover for firms to do and
*  individuals to do what's best in terms of how to use this test information.
*  Let's say we make you testings are and the Roma regime is put into place.
*  Over the first month,
*  what percentage of Americans do you think would show up to be tested?
*  Well, I would try and do a calculation about where might tests be most valuable.
*  And if the states are the ones who are buying tests and
*  providing them, encourage states to use them for those high valued purposes.
*  I think frequent testing in nursing homes might be all it would take to cut
*  the death rate in half right now.
*  The estimates are there's many as half of the deaths are actually taking place in
*  nursing homes.
*  And it seems to me that there's no hope for contact tracing there.
*  Let's talk about rebuilding all of the nursing homes.
*  I mean, that's not gonna happen anytime soon.
*  But if you tested everybody, initially every day, so
*  you know exactly who's infectious inside a nursing home.
*  Test all of the staff, test all of the visitors, then we should be able to
*  isolate the few who are infectious and really bring down the deaths in nursing
*  homes.
*  So I'd use those there first.
*  Second, I think it would be great to get Major League Baseball started again.
*  I think we should use the relatively small number of tests it would take to test all
*  the baseball players every day and let them start playing games in empty stadiums
*  because you need a lot more tests to test the fans to have them come in.
*  But we could be playing baseball in empty stadiums without any risk that we're
*  increasing this R factor and people enjoy baseball.
*  It would be an important signal of how we go back to work in this regime.
*  So I think that could be an important complement to nursing homes.
*  You know, to keep going-
*  There is a study out, I think it came out May 10th or May 11th.
*  And they did test everyone in Major League Baseball.
*  A lot of the staff, not just the players and hardly any of them are COVID positive.
*  Yeah.
*  So we tested so many of the NBA players, but given those sports are still not
*  reopening, doesn't that mean that something isn't enough?
*  Well, nobody kind of made a plan which says, look, if you're going to-
*  there was an initial plan which is like put all the baseball players in like the
*  big dome or something and isolate them.
*  But, you know, obviously they don't want that.
*  So they're going to be going home to their families.
*  Some of them are going to get infected in their families.
*  And so you need a plan for testing and retesting the baseball players.
*  If you want to make sure that one player doesn't infect another.
*  So you need to do some calculations about, okay, how frequently do we need to test?
*  And then also you alluded to this point before, which is how long, how do we have
*  to respond when somebody tests positive?
*  Like how long should they be isolated?
*  Both from other players, but also from the general public.
*  But if we just put together the plan, I think we could safely restart baseball
*  and do it with confidence knowing that we're not going to increase the
*  number of infections.
*  Not under the rumor regime, but in the world we live in, can we reopen our
*  colleges and universities for this coming fall?
*  Well, that's one of my list of kind of plans to actually work out.
*  So there's major league baseball, but then universities and then K-12
*  education, I think are the next two.
*  Part of the reality is that people are afraid of opening universities
*  and K-12 education right now.
*  If we had the tests, we can show everyone that if you test people frequently,
*  isolate the few who are infectious, as soon as you find out that they're
*  infectious, you can actually let people start to interact again without
*  raising this R number.
*  So I think it's totally possible to reopen universities and reopen schools.
*  Universities, you may make some adjustments beyond just test and isolate.
*  It may be that a 300 person lecture hall, unless it's well ventilated, is
*  just too risky because just even one person who's infectious could infect
*  many more.
*  And we have to see if that's true.
*  So you might have to have better ventilation or not have those big
*  lecture halls, but we could surely restart university education, restart
*  K-12.
*  And these would be very important things to do because we know how valuable
*  human capital is.
*  We know how high the returns are to those kinds of investments.
*  And I said before, I was doing some calculations the last couple of days.
*  The calculation I'm looking at is for each unit of testing capacity.
*  And if we could test one more person each day, how many more jobs or how
*  many more people could reenter their return to their previous activities.
*  And the model suggests that it's about nine.
*  So like testing one person per day throughout the year would free up about
*  nine people who could go back to doing what they were doing before, get out of
*  like the shelter in place rules and have no net effect on the reproduction
*  are because the tests depress it.
*  More people in circulation raise it.
*  You just set those numbers so that they balance each other out.
*  And, you know, nine economically active people is worth a hell of a lot more
*  than it costs to provide one test a day for a year.
*  How does your testing idea differ from Glenn Wiles testing idea?
*  I think Glenn and I are in agreement that tests are very valuable.
*  Glenn thinks that we can target the tests.
*  I'm saying just test everybody on a regular basis.
*  Glenn is saying you don't have to test everybody.
*  What you can do is target your tests of people who are more likely to be infectious.
*  And I agree that if you can target tests effectively, then you don't have to test
*  as many people because really all you have to do is find enough positives and
*  get them into isolation.
*  But I think Glenn is assuming that the way we're going to predict safely who
*  you know reliably who's infectious is through digital apps that do digital
*  contact tracing.
*  And I'm skeptical that that's going to be ready in time and ready in the sense
*  that everybody will be comfortable using it.
*  So I'm saying if we want to have a plan that we know we can execute on now or we
*  know we're not going to have a kind of divisive fight and get stuck because we
*  can't make a decision.
*  The way to do that is just don't make the digital contact tracing part of the
*  critical path. Just create a path where we get there, whether or not that can work.
*  And if it works, great. I'm not opposed to targeting the test.
*  You've got a good way to do it.
*  But don't make that a requirement for the path that protects us all.
*  Would you ever get involved in another charter city project?
*  Well, actually, just before I leave the testing, another one of the things as
*  economists and scientists, I think we really can usefully bring to these debates is
*  just quantification.
*  Just talk about the numbers.
*  So this morning I was trying to think the best estimate for you say from New York
*  State is that this infection fatality rate is about a half a percent.
*  So if you know, a half a percent of the people who catch an infection die.
*  And if you look at where we've got about 2000 people a day in the United States
*  who are dying. So that means that there are about 400000 people a day who are
*  newly infected.
*  Now, each of those 400000 people has, say, 10 contacts, which I think is modest.
*  It could be more. That means that there's 4 million people a day that you've got to
*  go out and find with your contact tracers.
*  And, you know, I'm not sure we've got the capacity to do that.
*  But the real point here is just that whether you follow Glenn's model or my
*  model, you're already up to 4 million tests a day, which is 10 times the capacity
*  we've got. So like, let's not even argue about whether Glenn's right or I'm right.
*  Let's just get a lot more tests because both of us think we need way more than we
*  have.
*  OK, charter cities. Would you try it again someday?
*  Sure. Absolutely.
*  Under what conditions?
*  I might rename it. You know, I don't know that, you know, in communicating the idea,
*  I don't know that Charter City is the best name, but I think the idea is
*  is still a compelling alternative.
*  And unfortunately, maybe this is now my shtick.
*  It's kind of like, you know, 100 billion a year on testing.
*  It's a kind of an unpleasant bad idea that nobody likes, but it's just better than
*  the alternatives. So the same thing is true.
*  I think on migration flows as on dealing with the pandemic, which is that
*  the alternatives are so terrible.
*  We may the best option may be something that's kind of bad, but, you know, it's kind
*  of expensive. We just do it anyway.
*  On the on the the the thing that I'm not sure we should call a charter city.
*  But the thing I think we could do is create new cities that would solve the current
*  impasse where you've got, you know, 750 million people who say they want to leave
*  the countries where they currently live and the existing countries that say we
*  can't take. We don't want to take that many people.
*  So I'm saying, OK, what's the middle ground here?
*  What's the deal we could do?
*  Let's create some new places that are still places that people want to go to, but
*  where nobody in existing countries feels threatened by the creation of those new
*  places. And let's try and offer that as a solution to what seems like this this
*  impasse.
*  How do you frame what happened in Honduras conceptually?
*  Yeah. So I thought in selling this idea to do this, you'd need both some country
*  that is willing to volunteer or supply the location for a new jurisdiction and
*  then some countries, country or more than one country, they can help establish the
*  new jurisdiction like its legal systems and so forth.
*  And administrative, all the systems you'd need.
*  I thought the biggest constraint on this idea was that it would be hard to find
*  countries that would be willing to say you could use our land to start something
*  new. So I spent time in Madagascar.
*  I spent time in Honduras.
*  They were actually willing to try this.
*  But what I think in retrospect, I should have done and what I'll do now is go
*  first to the countries which are willing to help set something up because a
*  country like Honduras was not, the reason it was willing to do something radical
*  like a new charter city was that it did not have the internal capacity to do
*  something like a charter city.
*  And what went wrong was that we couldn't get sufficient participation from outside
*  of Honduras in setting this up.
*  And then, frankly, in Honduras, there was a little bit of lack of transparency.
*  They didn't really want outsiders either because it was kind of a small group that
*  actually wanted to set these things up and control it internally.
*  So I think the scarce kind of player, the short side of this market is going to be
*  countries that are willing to say we will help set up a new place that people can go
*  to. They're the ones we need to, it's the citizens of those countries, potential
*  countries that we need to persuade this would be worth trying.
*  And if they're willing to do it, then I think we can find locations where it could
*  be done.
*  Do you worry about a negative selection effect in the volunteers?
*  So in a lot of your work, you're concerned with corruption quite appropriately, I
*  would say. And could it be the countries that want to do charter cities?
*  Well, it's one branch of the government wants to do something a little funny
*  without the other branches of the government seeing and in essence, cut its own
*  deal and that there's something intrinsically worrisome about a country
*  volunteering to do it.
*  Well, I think this is one of these places where we have to be willing to just select
*  from the feasible alternatives and not hold out for some ideal that we can't
*  achieve. And I think it's worth sort of like being specific here.
*  My hunch is that China will eventually realize that the way to make
*  the way to pay for the infrastructure that it's building as part of this Belt and
*  Road program is to do urban real estate development.
*  You never the transport never pays for itself.
*  It's always the real estate that goes up in value that you use to pay for all of
*  us. So I think that the Belt and Road project is inevitably going to turn to a
*  kind of a version of new city, city scale, real estate development to finance what
*  they're what they're trying to do.
*  I think in parallel, the United States could be offering its own version of
*  cities around the world that are new, that there's gains in the value of the land
*  that pay for the stuff you want to do.
*  And then to answer your question, would I be worried if that's the way that China
*  and the US compete with each other?
*  Actually, no, I think that would be pretty good.
*  The Chinese wouldn't set up those cities and run them exactly the way that some
*  somebody from the United States might prefer.
*  But I think if people who want to migrate could choose between a Chinese
*  location and a US location, that would put some pressure on both the US and China
*  to organize these new sort of opportunities in ways that really benefit the
*  people who will go there.
*  How important is religion for explaining economic development?
*  You said before norms are important and charter cities in a way are identifying
*  laws, rules, norms as a public good legal structure.
*  So why isn't religion also a key?
*  Well, I think it's it's important for us to think about what are the mechanisms
*  that we use to try and shape norms over time.
*  Some of them are just kind of an invisible hand process where nobody's in charge.
*  And norms often, I think, go in directions that are, you know, beneficial and
*  appropriate. There's a great book you may know of called
*  The Civilizing Process that looked about just from the Middle Ages up to the
*  present, looked at norms about just what it means to be polite or civilized, even
*  just table manners.
*  And it's really a fascinating account.
*  So some of this happens automatically, but some of it happens because of activists
*  and organizations and structures like churches.
*  And we should be at least mindful of what are the ways in which those different
*  bodies can push norms?
*  What are the ways that are beneficial to everyone, like that increase efficiency?
*  What are the ones that might harm efficiency?
*  How do we get more of the ones that increase efficiency?
*  I'm a Christian missionary.
*  I'm working in Nigeria and say I'm fairly persuasive and effective.
*  Is it possible I'm doing more for economic development than any economist?
*  It's possible, but you'd want to you'd really want to look in detail and see
*  which parts of the kind of the norms that are being conveyed there are beneficial
*  and which parts are not.
*  And then I think one also has to be thoughtful about the fact that we should ask,
*  are the people who are being socialized into some new norms aware of what the
*  transaction is? And are they agreeing in some sense?
*  Do they actually have some agency and some ability to choose?
*  Yes, I'm OK with this or no, maybe not.
*  And this is why I like the migration decision, because it involves a more
*  affirmative choice.
*  So if some missionaries set up a city and said, here's how this city will work.
*  You're welcome to come.
*  Then people could choose to go to that city or not and can choose to leave if they
*  don't like it when they when they get there.
*  I'd be a lot a lot more comfortable with it.
*  How optimistic are you more generally about the developmental trajectory for
*  Sub-Saharan Africa?
*  You know, there's a there's a saying I picked up from Gordon Brown, which is that
*  in establishing the rule of law, the first five centuries are always the hardest.
*  I think some parts of this development process are just very slow.
*  And so I think, you know, if you look around the world, all the efforts since
*  World War Two that's gone into trying to like build us, build strong, effective
*  states to establish the rule of law and a functioning state, I think external
*  investments in building states have yielded very little.
*  And so we need to think about ways to transfer the functioning of existing
*  states rather than just build them from scratch in existing places.
*  So that's really the that's a lot of the impetus behind this this charter city's
*  idea. It's both you select people coming in who have a particular set of norms
*  that then become the dominant norms in this new place.
*  But you also, you know, protect those norms by certain kinds of, you know,
*  administrative structures, state functions that that reinforce them.
*  And I think if we don't pay attention to that and just keep doing what we've been
*  doing in development assistance, I'm still fairly pessimistic about how many how
*  many will make the kind of radical transformation that China made.
*  If you could reform the World Bank, what would you do?
*  That's an interesting question.
*  I think the bank is trying to serve two missions and it can't do both.
*  One is a diplomatic function, which I think is very important.
*  You know, the World Bank is a place where somebody who represents the government of
*  China and somebody who represents the government of the United States sit in a
*  conference room and argue, should we do A or B?
*  And not just argue, but discuss, negotiate.
*  On a regular basis, they make decisions and it isn't just China and the U.S.
*  It's a bunch of countries.
*  I think it's very good for personal relationships, for the careers of people who
*  will go on to have other positions in these governments to have that kind of
*  experience of basically diplomatic negotiation over a bunch of relatively
*  small items, because it's a confidence building measure that makes it possible
*  for countries to make bigger diplomatic decisions when they have to.
*  So that, I think, is the value of the World Bank right now.
*  The problem is, is that that kind of diplomatic function is inconsistent with
*  the function of being a provider of scientific insight.
*  That the scientific endeavor has to be committed to truth, no matter whose
*  feathers get ruffled.
*  And there's certain kinds of, you know, like convenient fictions that are
*  required for diplomacy to work.
*  You start accepting convenient fictions in science and science is just dead.
*  So the bank's got to decide, is it engaged in diplomacy or science?
*  I think the diplomacy is its unique, you know, comparative advantage.
*  So therefore, I think it's got to get out of the scientific business.
*  It should just outsource its research.
*  It shouldn't try and be a research organization.
*  And it should just be transparent about what it can be good at and is good at.
*  And do you regret the time you spent there or what would you have done differently?
*  Well, I was brought in to reform the research group.
*  People in the bank could tell that research was dysfunctional there.
*  But shortly after I arrived, the number two, who I think had been behind this
*  initiative, left to go take a position back in the finance minister in Indonesia.
*  And a different number two came into the bank.
*  And, you know, in retrospect, what happened was that that number two decided
*  we're not going to reform research.
*  We don't want any, we don't want any noise.
*  Because, you know, you reform things, you're going to get noise.
*  You're going to get complaints.
*  All other parts of the bank had been reformed, research hadn't.
*  But so I wasted, you know, like 16 months talking to the number two and the number
*  one and saying, you understand if I'm really going to reform the research group,
*  there's going to be noise and it was going to be a little contentious.
*  You really want to do this, right?
*  And they, yeah, no, no, absolutely.
*  Full speed ahead.
*  We're totally, we're a hundred percent behind you.
*  We totally agree with each other.
*  And they were just lying to me.
*  And so I would go out and try and do something and they would just like undercut
*  every simple thing I tried to do.
*  So what I regret is the dishonesty of the leadership and failing to just say what
*  was, what was true, which is we changed our minds.
*  We don't want to reform research anymore.
*  So, so I spent, I spent months and months doing really simple things, like trying
*  to move to direct reports who reported to me, who didn't have the integrity to have
*  the kind of responsibility that they had.
*  But, you know, I was being, not only facing a bureaucratic system that opposed
*  moving these positions, I'm not even talking about firing them, just moving them out of
*  the critical position so other people could fill those roles and do them correctly.
*  I faced not only, you know, internal bureaucratic delays, but, you know, my bosses
*  were undercutting me and stopping me from, from doing this.
*  So I finally figured it out, said I was going to resign.
*  They told me, Oh no, I'd do enormous damage to the bank if you resigned.
*  And, you know, I still took what they said seriously.
*  So, so then I went out and just got myself fired.
*  I gave an interview in the Wall Street Journal, which I knew would make them mad.
*  And then they said, okay, well, you know, you broke the rules.
*  So we have to have an investigation.
*  I said, no, no, you don't have to have an investigation.
*  I broke the rules.
*  They said, okay, well then you have, we have to put you on administrative leave and you
*  have to sign this agreement where you won't say anything without our approval.
*  And I said, I'm not going to do that.
*  And then they said, okay, well, well then you have to resign.
*  And I said, well, that was what I tried to do on Thursday.
*  I resigned.
*  And that was the end of it.
*  Why are you interested in the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce?
*  Charles?
*  Charles Sanders Peirce.
*  Oh, oh, right.
*  P-E-I-R-C-E.
*  Oh, is that how you pronounce it?
*  People say it Peirce sometimes, but Peirce is...
*  I was thinking Peirce.
*  Correct.
*  The pragmaticist, yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, well, because, because I'm really interested in science and I think he was a
*  very deep thinker about science from this kind of pragmatic perspective of
*  how does it work?
*  What does it accomplish?
*  How can we get more of, how can we get more of that?
*  I think it was Tim, Tim Besley actually, another economist pointed me to him.
*  And I have to say it's heavy going to read his stuff, but I'm still quite interested.
*  You know, if you go, if you go back to what we were saying before about what could an
*  existing successful society bring when it sets up a new one, I used to think a lot
*  about, and as an economist, we talked a lot about, you know, like the rule of law and
*  as law is in some sense, the basis for things like honesty and trust.
*  I'm starting to think that science may have actually been more important for the West
*  in developing a culture where a reputation for integrity and telling the truth became
*  something that was valued.
*  Science may have actually been more important than we realize for that.
*  I very much agree with that.
*  And engineering, right?
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  So you said you agree.
*  And engineering also is a broader branch of science.
*  And if you look today at software engineers who have to make things work, they tend to
*  be blunt people who will frequently speak the truth.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  So, so I think, you know, when you think about this level of norms, a commitment that
*  it's a good thing to be honest, it's, it's a good thing to be disapproving of people
*  who are found not to be honest.
*  That's very helpful because it helps build trust and trust is an important part of
*  social interaction.
*  But so I think we may have underestimated the value of science.
*  And so it's all the more important to, to support it.
*  So it isn't just that it gives us some facts that feed into a discussion.
*  It conveys norms about integrity.
*  And, and also there's a harsh side to this, that when you are found to have misled
*  people intentionally, that those norms say you're, you're no longer taken seriously.
*  You're excluded.
*  You're not respected or listened to anymore.
*  But those kinds of things are critical, I think, for supporting trust.
*  And I think that we should learn how to protect science and get it to do its job
*  better in building those norms and encouraging trust.
*  What do you find most interesting in French fiction?
*  Well, actually, let me, let me just kind of bore on for one minute about this.
*  Sure, sure.
*  There's one of my, my, one of my predecessors at the World Bank as chief economist,
*  Justin Lin, has a very interesting paper on this puzzle of, you know, why didn't
*  China develop the industrial revolution?
*  And his argument is basically that China, because there were so many people looking
*  and discovering, they discovered a lot of things like, you know, gun powers, gun
*  powder, steel printing, so forth.
*  But what China didn't do was invent the social system we call science.
*  So they had some knowledge and some technology.
*  They didn't invent science.
*  And what was different in Europe was the invention of science.
*  So I found that argument really compelling.
*  And I've taken it one step further and think that, you know, part of what the West
*  benefited from were notions about integrity and individual, you know, responsibility
*  for what we say that fostered trust and that, and that science indirectly gave us,
*  gave us those things.
*  So I think, you know, for any country around the world, it's worth thinking about.
*  If you're short on that, if there's a tendency for a lot of people to cheat on their
*  taxes, to lie about what's true, you know, if there's kind of norms that, that hold
*  society back in those ways, I think it would be good to think about how do we rebuild
*  a system where we respect and admire people who consistently tell the truth and where
*  we, we look down on disapprove of people who are found to have intentionally misled us.
*  Do you think the evolution of science in the West has much to do with Christianity and
*  Christian norms, which do emphasize some of those values?
*  And science evolved in the West, right?
*  Yep.
*  That's out of the church.
*  That's a very good question.
*  I, I, I speculated in one group meeting about there's a difference between the kind of
*  the Old Testament version of Christianity and the New Testament version.
*  And my conjecture was that some of the Old Testament norms were closer to the ones that
*  matter for, for science.
*  You know, Christianity really succeeded by competing with other religions, partly because
*  it brought in redemption, forgiveness, you know, it was a softer, you know, the kind of
*  the New Testament version of Christianity was a softer, kinder form of Christianity.
*  It may be the older form of Christianity, you know, which is a tradition shared with
*  Judaism, where there was kind of a little bit more strictness about the tradition of
*  about the truth and integrity and more harmful consequences from violations of that.
*  It may actually be that earlier tradition that was the one that was most beneficial.
*  I tried to, I tried to say this about kind of Old Testament values and somebody accused
*  me of being anti-Semitic.
*  And I was talking about Christianity and I was actually saying it was good.
*  So I don't really quite understand.
*  One has to be a little careful when you when you talk about these issues.
*  French fiction, what do you find most interesting in that area?
*  Oh, you know, we have a division of labor in my house.
*  My wife is the one who you should ask about French fiction.
*  She's right now her goal is to get me to read any fiction at all.
*  I'm I'm I'm heavily biased towards nonfiction and she's just trying to broaden my
*  horizons a little bit.
*  But fiction is arguably one of the best ways to understand the norms of a society, right?
*  Yeah. Yep.
*  That's true. That's true.
*  And of course, no. So what am I going to cite to support that?
*  A piece of a piece of nonfiction.
*  There's a dean, a colleague of mine at NYU who had served as dean for many years.
*  So he looked at a large sample of promotion cases and he then tried to generalize.
*  What are the differences between the humanities and the sciences?
*  What what makes these things tick?
*  What are they? Where are they similar?
*  Where are they different?
*  And he wrote a really nice book called The Geography of Insight that talks about what's
*  distinctive about humanities as opposed to sciences and how they both contribute to a
*  better understanding of the world that we live in.
*  Last question, Thread.
*  What did you learn at Burning Man?
*  Oh.
*  Sometimes physical presence is necessary to appreciate something like scale.
*  The scale of everything at Burning Man was just totally unexpected.
*  It's a total surprise for me.
*  Even having looked at all of these pictures and so forth.
*  That was one.
*  Another thing that really stood out, it's not really not exactly a surprise, but maybe
*  was the surprise in that group.
*  If you ask, what do people do if you put them in a setting where there's supposed to be
*  no compensation, no quid pro quo, and you just give them a chance to be there for a
*  week, what do they do?
*  They work.
*  What people do at Burning Man is they go there and they work.
*  They'll do a different job.
*  Like they'll work as part of the volunteer police force or they'll help just maintain
*  sanitation.
*  They'll work to maintain the health of the people.
*  They'll work to maintain sanitation.
*  They'll work to set up something which offers a service to other people.
*  But there's enormous satisfaction that we draw from accomplishment and production and
*  the provision of the output that we produce, making it available to others.
*  So if somebody asked me, well, what's a post-scarcity society going to look like?
*  Somebody actually said this to me there.
*  What does post-scarcity society look like?
*  People work hard because they like it.
*  They work on things that they care about, they think others will care about.
*  And that's kind of an encouraging insight, I think, about people.
*  We can leave it at that.
*  Paul Romer, thank you very much.
*  Hope we can do this again someday.
*  Good.
*  My pleasure.
