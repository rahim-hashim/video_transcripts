# Russ Roberts on Israel and Life as an Immigrant  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_dOMTe7UUY)
*  Today is December 23rd, 2021, and today's episode of Econ Talk is also being released
*  as an episode of Conversations with Tyler.
*  I am speaking with Tyler Cowen of George Mason, who blogs at Marginal Revolution podcasts
*  at Conversations with Tyler.
*  It's his 14th appearance here on the program.
*  He was last here in April of 2021 talking about the pandemic.
*  We're going to do something a little unusual today.
*  We're going to talk about what it's like to be an immigrant using my move to Israel
*  this year as a way to launch the conversation.
*  As my listeners know, and to let listeners at Conversations with Tyler know, I came to
*  Israel to be president of Shalem College, a small liberal arts college here in Jerusalem.
*  And finally, I want to encourage Econ Talk listeners to go to our homepage to vote on
*  your favorite episodes of 2021.
*  Tyler, welcome back to Econ Talk.
*  Thank you very much for having me.
*  I'm so curious about your new ventures.
*  Let me start with a general question.
*  In the mature economies, why aren't there more new universities?
*  Shalem is in its ninth year.
*  And how is starting a new university in Israel different from in the United States?
*  Well, we have a very strange business model.
*  We lose money on every student and we make it up by volume.
*  We give all our students a stipend that covers their tuition and a good chunk of their living
*  expenses.
*  And as a result, in America, if that were the case, we take no money from the government.
*  It's all private donations.
*  And we're in competition, we like to thank for the best students here in Israel.
*  So they often are on scholarships, so we have to match that.
*  And that's the business model.
*  In America, if you don't take money from the government, you usually get less regulation.
*  In turn, that is not the case here.
*  The Council of Higher Education is extremely vigilant in making sure that we keep all of
*  our promises.
*  And they're very, very detail-oriented.
*  Number of toilets, I think, is regulated here per student.
*  So you can imagine starting a new major is we've got to get their approval.
*  We have to provide the syllabi of all the classes that we've been taught in the major.
*  We have to show the faculty that would be teaching in the major.
*  And we have to get a variety of committees to sign off on it.
*  So to create a whole college is a major enterprise.
*  The people who came before me did all that lifting, heavy and light.
*  And in America, the challenge, of course, is both accreditation and reputation.
*  You're in competition with existing, like any new entrant, you have to compete with
*  the existing competitors.
*  And in the case of college, brand name is extremely important in America, obviously.
*  People have emotional ties to colleges.
*  I think there are very, very few new colleges that are at the highest level.
*  As you know, of course, University of Austin is aspiring to be one of those startups in
*  America.
*  But it's not an easy task.
*  So being a university president, it also has a managerial side.
*  How are you feeling managerial culture as being different in Israel compared to the
*  United States?
*  Well, I don't have a lot of managerial experience.
*  I kind of took a leap of faith.
*  You've managed your own career your entire life.
*  Yeah, a tremendous experience.
*  And that meant managing a very difficult person, actually.
*  So it's actually quite encouraging.
*  In all seriousness, the job I've grown in, you know, in the six months I've been on the
*  ground here, it's been a wonderful experience, adventure.
*  We'll talk about what it's like to live here.
*  But to flex a bunch of muscles that I haven't used much or that I didn't know I had, it's
*  a very multifaceted job.
*  There's managing people, there's curriculum and faculty and student issues, there's fundraising.
*  Can you be more direct when you're managing in Israel?
*  There's a reputation that Israelis are super direct, that don't mince words.
*  Is that true?
*  And how does that influence how you manage people?
*  You just tell them what to do?
*  Do they tell you what to do?
*  Or how is it different?
*  Well I think there's a lot of my management team at the senior level are speaking English
*  and are American.
*  So even though they're Israelis now and they're all citizens of Israel as I am, they bring
*  a lot of their American baggage with them even though they've unpacked for sure.
*  In terms of the staff and the students, there is a directness.
*  With the students, it's quite interesting.
*  They come here when they're typically 23, 24 years old to start their college career,
*  very different than in America.
*  And despite having served in the army, they are remarkably young in a certain way.
*  They have an energy and an openness that's very refreshing.
*  The bluntness part, I don't sense so much on their end.
*  In terms of the staff, it's not really an issue.
*  At least I have an experience.
*  What I think it causes though is a certain hesitation on my part for interaction.
*  I've got the language barrier.
*  For the native Israelis here, I try to speak Hebrew with them to amuse them.
*  And they're very kind.
*  And then we typically end up speaking in English if it's anything substantive outside
*  of how was your weekend.
*  And they're very blunt, straightforward.
*  I kind of like it.
*  You're an Adam Smith scholar.
*  And as you know, Smith and many of the other classical economists, they were worried about
*  the decline of martial virtue in a commercial society with division of labor.
*  And now that you've lived in Israel, how does this worry seem to you?
*  More justified, totally false?
*  How do you view it?
*  It's a deep question.
*  I appreciate the flattery of calling me a Smith scholar.
*  I wrote a book on Smith, which of course makes me an expert.
*  But I'm not really an expert.
*  The martial side, the military side here is utterly fascinating.
*  There's a big conversation going around here about whether Israel should continue with
*  the draft or go to model close to the United States of a volunteer army.
*  It's an enormous socializing experience here for the young people to go through that.
*  It's challenging, difficult, often physically difficult.
*  And it permeates a lot of life here.
*  In the way that there are certain networks of college, for example, in America or a private
*  school system, you have a certain natural connection to the graduates.
*  Here in Israel, the unit you were in, the kind of unit you were in, the people that
*  you were in that unit with, I think has a very powerful lifelong effect.
*  It has some, it's jarring often to an American who comes here.
*  There's a lot of people walking around with their Uzis, their automatic weapons.
*  First time you see that, it's a little bit scary.
*  Second time kind of can be okay.
*  You feel pretty, it's kind of comforting.
*  It's a part of life here along with reserve duty and other, I have students who missed
*  the first three weeks, we have students who missed the first three weeks of class because
*  they had reserve duty or they were on some project.
*  That's intense.
*  It's just very alien to most Americans.
*  Given the rising importance of cyber warfare, it seems for Israel most of all, should Israel
*  still have a draft?
*  Isn't the future of Israeli security drones, cyber defense, cyber attacks, other advanced
*  weapons, it's a tech story rather than a personnel story?
*  Yes, no.
*  Yeah, you'd think so.
*  I think for the, and that may be partly what's driving the, having a conversation about our
*  volunteer army.
*  They don't have, Israel doesn't have the personnel needs that it had for an army that
*  it would have had 20 years ago.
*  There are a lot of units here where people in them can't tell you what they're in because
*  they're, I think, highly classified, highly involved in those kind of cyber security issues.
*  I think it's a big issue for the world.
*  It's going to be an incredible thing to see how this changes warfare in general.
*  But it's a key part of Israel's arsenal, obviously.
*  They've been very successful in using cyber attacks to slow down Iran's nuclear program,
*  for example.
*  That's the received wisdom.
*  But will the Israeli military plus conscription still over time produce that sense of social
*  solidarity if the military personnel themselves are not in the long run responsible for national
*  security?
*  Won't it become a kind of Straussian facade and at some point fade away or be viewed cynically
*  or not serve its original socially unified function?
*  I don't know.
*  I think there's a lot of cohesion here that we're not seeing.
*  It's a very fractious political environment here, as you know.
*  A lot of political parties, parliamentary system, no constitution, a lot of yelling
*  in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
*  But despite all that, because of, I think, the external threat, there's a lot of cohesion
*  here whether there's an army or not.
*  The other part of the army that I think is fascinating is the age of the people in leadership
*  positions very early in their career.
*  There are people in their mid-20s, early 20s who have the lives of 100 or more people in
*  their hands, in their units.
*  It creates a different kind of mentality here.
*  I can't say I've sensed it personally, but that's my impression.
*  I don't know what will happen.
*  It's a fascinating question.
*  What will happen to Israeli social life if the army becomes less central?
*  But right now, that's not the case.
*  As you know better than I do, the Israeli media landscape is very different from the
*  American media landscape, though they overlap.
*  How has that changed your mind about podcasting?
*  How do you view podcasting differently from Israel?
*  It's a lot of work podcasting from Israel.
*  One of the challenges of moving here is that a huge chunk of my life gets crammed into
*  3 p.m. to 7 p.m.
*  Because 3 p.m. is kind of the earliest you can expect somebody for a meeting or an interview
*  in the United States when it's going to be 8 p.m. on the East Coast and certainly on
*  the West Coast it's even a bigger difference.
*  Starting around 3 o'clock, my day tends to get a little more crowded and intense.
*  Just on a logistics matter, it's challenging.
*  I don't have a very good feel for the newspaper world here, but newspapers are much more important
*  than they are in America.
*  They haven't died out.
*  They're not just online.
*  It's fun to walk around on an afternoon or a morning in Jerusalem and see four or five
*  different newspapers out for sale, even if I can't read all of them or most of them and
*  sometimes any of them.
*  My Hebrew is so embryonic and mediocre, but they come with a flavor.
*  I think that's part of what you're alluding to.
*  They're more like TV in America.
*  They have often an ideology and a certain perspective.
*  American newspapers until recently, I would say, pretended they were objective.
*  I think there's less of a pretense lately.
*  How podcasting fits into that, I don't know.
*  I listen to some Hebrew language podcasts and my Hebrew is not good enough to listen
*  to the other ones.
*  I should maybe be trying, but podcasting.
*  You've remarked to me in the past that in Israel, baseball seems less important to you.
*  Does podcasting seem more or less important there?
*  That's interesting.
*  Sports does seem less important, partly because the games are on often at 310 in the morning
*  here, which kind of reduces my...
*  I'm not a recorder kind of person.
*  I don't have time to watch them.
*  I'm at my leisure so much anyway, anymore.
*  Econ talk doesn't seem less important, but I am surprised at how much I enjoy the challenge
*  of improving the classroom here.
*  We have an amazing set of teachers here.
*  I want them to be better.
*  We're trying to make the evaluation process a little more sophisticated and less a customer
*  service on a scale of one to five.
*  I'm not sure how much I like your faculty member or your professor.
*  Trying to inculcate certain, inculcate our faculty to certain styles of teaching and
*  expose them to certain ideas.
*  I'm enjoying that much more than I thought I would and I'm much more passionate about
*  it.
*  I'm a little bit dangerous, Tyler.
*  I'm what's called in Hebrew a new oleh, one who's come upward, who's come up to the land,
*  the land of Israel.
*  I find my passion for things Israeli and my national identity way out of line with what
*  I thought it would be as a person who's, I've been here many times.
*  I've been here a dozen or so times to visit.
*  I lived here as a teenager for eight months when I was in high school with my family.
*  My dad's company sent him here.
*  I sort of thought I knew what it would be like to live here.
*  I know it wouldn't be the same as being a tourist, but I've been surprised at how much
*  national pride I have, how I'm not quite as interested in what's going on in America.
*  I thought I'd stay connected to either sports, politics, which is just a different form of
*  sports sometimes, but it's very different.
*  And I think, you know, you read stories of immigrants who come to America and who are
*  very emotional when they pass their citizenship tests.
*  I feel the same thing here and it's been a pleasant surprise.
*  And the Torah now feels different when you read it, living as an Israeli.
*  In the Torah?
*  In the Torah?
*  Or the Hebrew Bible more broadly?
*  In the Jewish Bible?
*  Yeah, no, no, no.
*  I just thought, I'm not sure I heard you correctly.
*  It's interesting, sitting in a synagogue here on Saturday morning, which I used to do in
*  America, the biggest difference isn't the Torah reading.
*  It's the blessing for the state of Israel, which gets recited every Saturday morning
*  in a Jewish synagogue in America.
*  There's also a prayer for the soldiers of the IDF, the Israel Defense Force.
*  It's much more visceral here.
*  People pay attention.
*  You know, you feel like you're actually saying something that matters and that means something.
*  As for the Torah, I think the biggest thing that I felt actually wasn't in services or
*  reading the Bible.
*  It's exploring different parts of the country I hadn't ever been to before.
*  When we first got here early on, we went up north to the Golan Heights, which Israel didn't
*  have access to until the 1967 war.
*  It's still controversial in some quarters, of course.
*  It's really a stunningly beautiful part of the country.
*  And you can walk a town called Gamla.
*  Gamla was a Jewish town in Roman times that the Romans destroyed, a little bit like Masada.
*  And they've uncovered the mosaic floor of a synagogue.
*  There's some houses, the floors and walls of partial houses are still visible.
*  And it's a very wild part of the country.
*  There's big ravines and outcrops.
*  And then in the distance, you can see the Sea of Galilee, the Canary in Hebrew.
*  And it just felt different that there's a Jewish presence in that outpost in the middle
*  of nowhere that's 2000 years old.
*  It's a part of something that, obviously intellectually I felt it before I moved here, but moving
*  here and feeling that's very different and being there and standing on that, having that
*  town to ourselves, my wife and I, we hike to the top.
*  It's a little tiny space, hard to believe that a few thousands of people live there.
*  But it's a crazy, crazy archaeological experience to be part of that and other things like it.
*  So that's what's to me is more special.
*  The holiest part of Israel, most people would say, would be the Temple Mount, if a Jew would
*  say, is the Temple Mount and the Kotel, the wall, the supporting wall of the Temple Mount
*  that Jews pray at every day now.
*  We have access to it since 1967.
*  Jews have been praying there for thousands of years.
*  It's very moving to be there.
*  I'm about an 18 or 20 minute walk from there.
*  And I've been there once since I've been here.
*  In the past, I'd come here every trip, had to make sure I got to the Kotel and the old
*  city. And I'm surprised how little I've been there.
*  The sort of work a day suburban, not suburban, urban streets of Jerusalem feel special in
*  a way that doesn't require that past hovering over it.
*  It's just a great book's emphasis at Shalem, if I understand correctly.
*  If you had a bit more time than you probably have and wanted to choose one or two great
*  books, Hebrew Bible aside, of course, to make sense of your time and experience in Israel,
*  what would you pick and why?
*  Well, in our students, it's crazy.
*  We're great books curriculum, but sort of.
*  But there's so many things we try to cover because we also have not just Western civilization,
*  but Jewish thought and also other civilizations, our neighborhood, Middle East, the Middle
*  East neighborhoods.
*  Our students read the Jewish Bible.
*  They read the Talmud.
*  They read the Koran.
*  They read the New Testament.
*  And we have, of course, an Indian culture, civilization and religion as well.
*  So it gets a little crowded.
*  It gets a little crowded.
*  You're asking me though, what book I would want to read.
*  To make sense of your own experience in Israel, which great book?
*  Well, I'm a sucker.
*  I think I'd pick the Odyssey.
*  It's about travel, adventures, a sense of home, a very reliable wife who's come with
*  me for this adventure.
*  And I've been writing about it recently for my next book, Penelope's decision in dealing
*  with the absence of her husband.
*  But the idea of that book, which I think is just one of my favorite books is the Odyssey,
*  is the idea that home pulls you.
*  And now I have two homes.
*  It's a little bit weird.
*  I was born in Memphis, Tennessee.
*  I've never lived long anywhere in the United States.
*  Maryland's the longest.
*  My time in America when I was teaching at George Mason and later working at the Hoover
*  Institution, which I'm still affiliated with, by the way, 18 years of my 67 were spent in
*  suburban Washington, D.C., which is roughly a quarter and certainly more than a quarter
*  of my adult life.
*  And so there's a certain home there.
*  I have certain friends there.
*  And now all of a sudden this feels like home.
*  And I don't know what Odysseus was, he must have had a lot of ups and downs when he was
*  thinking about whether to come home or not.
*  But he came home.
*  So I think that helps me a little bit.
*  The United States has, I think, about 330 million people.
*  Yet there are more Israeli TV shows I want to watch than American TV shows.
*  There's Shrugim, there's Shatisel, there's Prisoners of War, there's In Judgment, there's
*  Tehran, there's more.
*  Why is Israeli TV so good?
*  I'm glad you mentioned Prisoners of War.
*  It doesn't get enough.
*  Prisoners of War is in my top five.
*  If I had to list my top five, I'd pick Shatisel, Prisoners of War, the Americans, probably
*  the Wire and the Crown.
*  Do you have a top five?
*  Sopranos would be my number one.
*  Shrugim and Prisoners of War plausibly would be in my top five.
*  So Prison of War, by the way, is very much about it.
*  Curb your enthusiasm.
*  That's in my top five, too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yes, very different thing.
*  It's very different.
*  What I love about those other ones, when they're done well, is there a form of long-form storytelling
*  is simply not available to us until now.
*  The closest thing I guess you could have had to it in the past would be a Dickens novel
*  that came out every week.
*  You couldn't binge read it.
*  You had to wait for the next installment.
*  I'm sure there's been many PhD theses written about how the impact of that weekly thing
*  affected Dickens' style and so on.
*  It's an interesting question.
*  I have an answer.
*  I want to hear your answer first.
*  What's your answer?
*  I think the audience is more demanding and has evolved into an equilibrium where they
*  expect something more intellectually substantive from television, and precisely because it's
*  not economically so viable.
*  The notion that at the margin you get a much bigger audience by pandering to more people
*  just doesn't go that far in Israel.
*  Now, this may change as Israeli shows themselves become more popular.
*  So I worry about this.
*  But that would be my offhand answer.
*  Smarter, more demanding audience plus limited incentives to sell out.
*  That's really interesting.
*  There's some really bad Israeli TV shows that I've enjoyed that take weird and strange turns.
*  I'll mention The Good Cop, Hoshotar Atov, which is often in really bad taste and quite
*  amusing.
*  It all of a sudden gets really serious in season two or three.
*  It starts off as a sort of silly comedy.
*  Similarly, The Beauty and the Baker, which is this cheesy, there's an American version
*  of it too, but in the Israeli version it's this baker.
*  He somehow gets tangled up with this movie star, this model, and she's a model, I guess,
*  not a movie star.
*  But you think, it's cheap fun.
*  Then all of a sudden it gets really serious.
*  Families get involved and it takes these strange and inexplicable turns that I'm sure
*  it's partly driven by the economics of the business.
*  But I think there's another thing to think about, which is Jews created Hollywood.
*  We've been, Jews have been making good movies for a long time.
*  We're called the people of the book.
*  We're interested in storytelling.
*  Just a standard thing Jews have been doing for a long time.
*  Now why Israelis per se are so good at it is an interesting question.
*  It's obviously a function of wealth and the ability now to market those stories to a much
*  wider audience.
*  But I think your point about how subtitles and Netflix allowed that to reach a much wider
*  audience than was available before.
*  It really is kind of a puzzle.
*  They're not particularly designed, I don't think, anymore for the Israeli market.
*  The real puzzle to me is why they're popular now, why they're so good.
*  Why do people want to watch a Shtizel, which is not a champion of Shtizel?
*  There's actual romantic tension.
*  That's the thing with Shtizel and Shrugim.
*  In American shows or even European shows, you can say, oh, why don't they just divorce?
*  Or why don't they just go to bed together?
*  Or why don't they just whatever?
*  But in Shrugim and Shtizel, it's always a question what the boundaries are, and that's
*  hard to recreate.
*  Yeah, it's one of my favorite scenes in Shtizel is when Akiva and I think it's Bat Sheva,
*  she pretends or is actually interested in buying and renting a heater from him, a portable
*  radiator.
*  And he's just started this business.
*  He's put up a sign around town.
*  It's very entrepreneurial for him.
*  He's got he doesn't get doesn't have much to do with himself other than art.
*  And she shows up at the doorway and it lasts about 30 seconds.
*  There's incredible tension in that scene, romantic and sexual tension.
*  And it's because they can't, they're not going to do anything.
*  And they're good actors.
*  And so it's very it's a very powerful scene.
*  I've also argued, I think part of the appeal of that show that there's a certain anthropological,
*  you know, voyeurism.
*  And there's a culture in a community that's that's very alien to most people, you know,
*  including modern Orthodox Jews.
*  It's a very different form of religious Judaism, the ultra Orthodox that that they're portraying
*  in that show.
*  And you know, part of the charm of the show is that all they have the same problems we
*  do, you know, they have trouble with their kids, they're not sure who's you know, what
*  they're going to make a living.
*  And so that's part of the charm.
*  But I think the other part of the charm is what you're talking about.
*  There's a certain old fashionedness there that people may not want to live that way
*  themselves.
*  But they like watching it the way they like reading a Jane Austen novel where the worries
*  of romance are long gone in the past.
*  And there's a certain innocence, I think, to the characters in Stiesel, which makes
*  it so deeply appealing.
*  The only other observation I want to make, which I think is so fascinating to me is it's
*  a show about religious, ultra religious, ultra Orthodox Jews, some still Judaism in the show.
*  They murmur and mutter blessings under their breath.
*  But there's no glorification of say the religious experience of the Shabbat.
*  And they don't make fun of it either.
*  There's no mocking of it or of the attitudes.
*  They're just taken as they are.
*  And I think that was a genius move by the creators to make that show the way it is.
*  Which Israeli norm is hardest for you to deal with?
*  Negotiation is challenging.
*  I think it's particularly hard for my wife, who likes set prices.
*  A lot of prices here are just kind of suggestions.
*  They're an invitation to negotiate.
*  And there are a few settings in America where that's normal.
*  You buy a house or a car, you don't expect a payless price.
*  But you do expect a payless price for say a haircut or I don't know, a red carpet or
*  a repair or something.
*  But a lot of times the price they announce is just like a hint or a suggestion.
*  And it's very hard for Americans to respond to that.
*  If you come here and you get off the plane and you get in a cab, I don't think the price...
*  This happens in America, right?
*  Prices in America are in a cab, off the meter, often negotiated.
*  The cab driver will say something and say, how about if we don't use the meter?
*  How about a flat rate?
*  But in America you kind of know what it's going to be because you've been in cabs in America.
*  It's a newcomer, you don't always know how far it's going to be, what the real fare should be.
*  And so you're kind of vulnerable.
*  And so a lot of Americans I know get angry when the cab driver says,
*  let's take it off the meter and pay cash.
*  They say, well no, put it on the meter.
*  And then a friend of mine was telling me, he got yelled at by the cab driver,
*  like I don't want to put it on the meter.
*  I'm thinking, but that's the job.
*  That's the rule.
*  Come on, put it on the meter.
*  And I think the anger of the cab driver was really just, hey, we're negotiating here.
*  We're having fun.
*  Here's the game.
*  It's not theater, but it is a game.
*  And there is some theater involved because you don't know how the drama is going to end.
*  But I think here it's a little bit of the fabric of daily life, right?
*  And that's a little strange.
*  It takes some getting used to.
*  I think when I rented my apartment here, I think it was an eight or a 10 page lease.
*  I had to hire a lawyer.
*  Never had a lawyer for a lease.
*  I've rented a dozen places and 20 places in America.
*  That was strange.
*  What I do to sign the lease, things I had to do to get the lease done, insurance I bought,
*  weird stuff that just doesn't happen in America and it's all in Hebrew.
*  So that part's kind of challenging.
*  Anything else?
*  An Israeli friend of mine suggested I ask you the following question.
*  Quote, are you tired of being a friar?
*  Unquote.
*  Yeah, friar is the slang phrase.
*  I assume it's Yiddish.
*  It sounds Yiddish to me.
*  There are a few Yiddish words that get peppered into Israeli daily speech.
*  Not much, not like you'd think.
*  Because, of course, the early days of Israel was very much a revolt against the Eastern European mentality.
*  Hebrew was going to be spoken here, not Yiddish.
*  Jews here were going to be strong and proud, not hunched over a book.
*  They were going to fight in the army.
*  There's a certain huge pride, actually, in that here.
*  As a result, the best slang is Arabic.
*  There's an enormous number of Arabic words that are used daily.
*  I like to tease my Israeli friends that there's no Hebrew word for fun.
*  When you tell them that, they say, whoa, yes, there is keff.
*  It's an Arabic word.
*  It's important.
*  It's kind of a cheap shot at the seriousness of life here.
*  And it's not true.
*  There's a lot of vibrancy.
*  And people here have a lot of fun.
*  But there's no native Hebrew word for fun.
*  I blame it on Ben Yehuda.
*  But the word friar is a very, very interesting word.
*  And it's an interesting aspect of Hebrew nature, of human nature, because it means a sucker.
*  And some Americans here will talk about the friar tax.
*  The amount of money extra pay, because you just don't know what you're doing here.
*  You're just lost.
*  You don't know the norms.
*  And I try not to worry about being a friar.
*  I view it as a form of charity.
*  I have a comfortable life.
*  I can pay a little bit extra.
*  It's not a problem.
*  I'm happy to do it.
*  But people worry about it, I think, emotionally.
*  And I think it's an important part of human nature that economics doesn't have much to say about.
*  The fear that you're being taken advantage of drives a lot of bad behavior on both sides, various transactions, if you don't have a good level of trust.
*  As we well know, a significant portion of the population of Israel is Arabic in descent.
*  What do you think you're learning about those Arabic cultures living in Israel?
*  Not as much as I'd like to yet.
*  I mean, I've only been here six months.
*  There's a lot of it partly depends on where you live, of course, but in the parts of Jerusalem that I live in and walk in near our campus here, there's a lot of Arab Israelis.
*  Most people don't know this.
*  I don't know it well, so I may embarrass myself.
*  But people who are born within the borders of the Jewish state right now and the borders of Israel who are not Jewish, Arab Israelis are full citizens.
*  They get full health care.
*  They get to go subsidize to the universities.
*  They vote.
*  They don't serve in the army, which is fascinating.
*  They don't want to serve in the army, incidentally, which I also understand is complicated for them.
*  And those are distinct from the West Bank and Gaza, who are Palestinians.
*  Then there's some special categories of folks who live in East Jerusalem, which is a disputed, more challenging.
*  And I don't know all the ins and outs of that.
*  But my wife is going to open.
*  Open is Hebrew lessons.
*  She goes to open three hours a day, four days a week.
*  Twenty two of her twenty three, I think, or twenty one of her twenty three classmates are Arab, Arab Israelis who think their Hebrew is not good.
*  And they all speak Hebrew.
*  They speak very good English, but the Hebrew is not good enough.
*  So they're they're improving their Hebrew because they want to go to a good university.
*  They want to get a good education.
*  They want to be in business.
*  And they're all young, by the way.
*  They're all in their in their 20s.
*  But I don't have I don't have much exposure to to the Arab Israeli population yet.
*  So I'm something to you're both non-Muslims.
*  What is it you think we can or should be learned from the Koran?
*  I don't know the Koran.
*  I love the Muslim religious Muslims I've met face to face as opposed to the ones that, you know,
*  are called the cultural zeitgeist of Islam that's in the air in the West.
*  But the actual Muslims that I've met face to face, you know, I have a lot in common with them.
*  We we we believe in God.
*  I think they have a very deep, deep faith, which some Jews have, but not all even religious Jews, I think,
*  struggle with faith in a way that many Muslims and Christians, for that matter, don't struggle with.
*  So I think there's something to learn there.
*  I think it's possible.
*  You know, I'm naive.
*  I like to think there's a way that the great religions of the world would would get along a little bit better.
*  The pro the followers of those religions and on the ground face to face.
*  You know, I think we get along pretty well, but not going so well overall.
*  So in the outside world, so here's a work to do.
*  And as an economist, as an economist, I like to think that, you know, commercial interaction helps.
*  Do you think that helps? Do you think it's a think trade?
*  Do you take what do you think of this view of the trade leads to be overrated by many of us at many margins?
*  Clearly, it's true.
*  Trade also helps you build up weaponry.
*  Trade can solidify groups within a nation.
*  An overrated proposition, though on average true.
*  That's how I would classify it.
*  Yeah, I like that.
*  So in the 19th century, Europe had plenty of trade, right?
*  The world was remarkably globalized and you get World War One, you get World War Two.
*  I'm not saying the trade caused that, but you can see it's what you might call a complicated regression.
*  Yeah, here's another religious question.
*  Yeah, it's a fascinating example.
*  And take away power from a group of rabbis.
*  That's a kind of deregulation.
*  You're a market oriented economist.
*  Are you happy or should you be worried as a religious observant Jew that this could mean a higher probability of some Israelis eating non kosher food?
*  Yeah, it's a fascinating example.
*  Listeners should know that there is not the modal family in Israel.
*  The ultra orthodox are a percentage of the country and they're a politically powerful percentage because they tend to vote as a bloc.
*  But there are really all kinds of variations now, both religiously and non religiously in Israel that are extremely fascinating.
*  Many Jews here are secular.
*  Their Judaism is that they live in a Jewish state.
*  Now there are other Jews who are religious and then in between that there's all kinds of stuff happening here that's really fascinating.
*  I recommend the book The Wondering Jew by Micah Goodman that came out in the last few years about what's going on on the ground here in Israel
*  and the amount of religious innovation that's happening and how people who are quote not religious are connecting to Jewish text, people who are religious or leading more open lives.
*  I think the tension between the religious and the non religious here is somewhat overrated.
*  Having said that, some of the source of that tension is governmental mandates.
*  The treat gives a preferences for subsidies to childbearing, which the ultra orthodox tend to have much, much larger families.
*  Families are much larger here in Israel than in America generally, secular and religious, but the ultra orthodox tend to have the larger families.
*  They've used their political power to get both subsidies for children, exemptions from army service, and other forms of special treatment that non religious Jews not surprisingly find offensive.
*  I don't think the alliance of the state with the Jewish religion has necessarily been a good thing.
*  Many people before me have pointed out that the United States is generally a more religious country than Europe.
*  There's no state religion in America. Most of Europe has state religion.
*  The state doesn't do anything particularly well and it doesn't tend to lead to good feelings about religion.
*  It has not over time.
*  So when you ask the question, if you take away some monopoly power from the rabbinate, the rabbinic authorities here, are you going to get less kosher food?
*  The answer is you might get more kosher food.
*  It's a lot of resentment of the way that the kosher certification has worked here.
*  A lot of people feel that a lot of times a fee is collected and not much supervision takes place.
*  These are non religious people who resent that they're paying for something that gives them the certificate they need to serve their religious customers, but don't like the hypocrisy of that system.
*  It's a fantastic example, by the way, of the natural assumption most people have that when there's a law it gets enforced or when there's a law the government does it well.
*  I've had people say to me, what if we move to a more decentralized system? People won't be able to trust the kosher certification.
*  Are you sure you trust it now? When the government has a monopoly driven by rabbinic oversight, a lot of people say it doesn't work so well.
*  I'm excited about the role competition might play in the process.
*  I think it'll lead to cheaper kosher food, more kosher food, more restaurants offering certified kosher food that I think will actually be kosher and will be fine.
*  Let me give you a perspective I sometimes hear from Israelis.
*  I'm going to put this in maybe more public choice terminology than they would use.
*  I've heard it argued that secular Israelis to some extent free ride upon the more stricter, more religious Israelis who do more to shore up the unity of Judaism or the cultural foundation of the country.
*  And thus, that as part of the bargain, the more extreme religious individuals have to be given some kinds of political preferences to keep them on board.
*  As you know, decades ago, many of the ultra orthodox were anti-Zionist rather than Zionist as they now tend to be.
*  So there is actual pressure where everyone has to be in the Rikers winning coalition and things like monopoly power over kosher certification, whatever it's going to be.
*  But you have to give them something. Is that an accurate way of thinking about the Israeli political dilemma?
*  Well, it's not accurate. It might be useful.
*  Is it useful?
*  You know, that's a good… I've never heard that quite that way.
*  I think… by the way, I think many of the… there's a wide range of views about what the role of the state should be in the country and whether there should be more…
*  the government should be more sympathetic or less sympathetic to the religious currents here.
*  Jerusalem tends to be a more, quote, religious city than Tel Aviv, but there are plenty of orthodox people and religious people in Tel Aviv and there's plenty of non-observant people here in Jerusalem.
*  They tend to have different rules about how Sabbath is kept in terms of public services and cultural norms also, of course, play a role.
*  But I don't… I don't like that idea. As a Jew, I don't like that idea. As a religious person, I don't like the idea that this implicit bargain, that somehow the ultra-orthodox are carrying the water of the ballast, or I don't know what you would call it, anchoring the Jewishness of the country.
*  You know, it's not even… I don't think it's an issue for most Israelis to think about it that way. I don't think it would come naturally. I think that's definitely a Riker-esque reference to William Riker, who I got to be a colleague of for about five years at the University of Rochester.
*  He was a wonderful, wonderful man, very insightful and an incredible twinkle in his eye. And his work… I think you've probably read it, Tyler. He was applying a lot of economics tools in his day long before other folks. He's kind of, I think, forgotten among our colleagues.
*  But I like them all.
*  Because living in Israel and being a citizen there make you more or less utilitarian in your moral philosophy.
*  Why would it? Curious.
*  The Israeli policies toward hostages, as I understand them, which is imperfectly. But from what I can tell, I admire these views. The notion that if someone takes hostages, you simply have to look at the longer term calculation and you can't cave to every demand. You need to play it quite tough.
*  That seems to me…
*  Is that utilitarian or non-utilitarian?
*  From my point of view, it's utilitarian. But I'm asking you, I'm not insisting you take my point of view. Living in Israel, has it made you more or less utilitarian?
*  I'm not much of a utilitarian. I think all of us have some utilitarian impulses by certain cases where it's overwhelmingly clear that too many people benefit from something or the size of it is so large.
*  But I think in most of the interesting cases, I think our profession has been so damaged overall by our profession, I mean economics, by the Benthamite calculus. I went back and read Bentham in the last year.
*  I'm a big Bentham fan, though I'm not at all a pure utilitarian. But even on issues such as gay rights or animal welfare or monetary theory or usury laws or tariffs, he's a fantastic thinker and economist. Penal reform.
*  How about the designated hitter? I mean, you're showing his incredible breadth.
*  I don't think Bentham wrote about the designated hitter. You know, I disliked it in baseball, but that's maybe topic for another podcast.
*  It is, but I have to ask, do you still dislike it?
*  I've become neutral only in the sense that I've stopped caring about baseball. So I would be anti-DH.
*  Why have you stopped caring about baseball? You haven't moved to Israel.
*  I've moved other places and it's too time consuming. It's hard to watch in chunks. I think it's a less efficient game than it used to be.
*  They've tried to speed it up. They've tried some ways to speed it up. It's really not the it's not just the total time. It's everything, right?
*  It's not a game made for the TikTok generation. Or even the YouTube generation, right? Yeah, exactly.
*  But going back to Bentham, he doesn't... I haven't read a lot of Bentham, but I'm surprised at how little he has to say.
*  He gives you this overarching theory that we can take all of our pains and pleasures.
*  So it's very important to emphasize this. And it's, you know, the pleasures aren't just physical pleasures, not just about gluttony and our animal drives.
*  He knows he understands pride and he understands satisfactions and more ethereal and other kinds.
*  But he gets into a problem, which is that after a while when you start adding them all up, you can't add them up anymore.
*  They can't really be quantified. And he was, as far as I understand, I'd be curious to your take on this, he never could solve that problem.
*  He was constantly hoping. You know, we try to solve it as economists through money, not literally money, but by putting a monetary value.
*  So I'm going to, in the next five minutes of Tyler, I'm going to say something embarrassing about your past that I've discovered.
*  And I could ask you, it's just an example, Tyler, I don't really know anything about it.
*  I can't imagine this anything embarrassing, but suppose I knew something about you.
*  And I said, you know, Tyler, before the show, I said, you know, if you don't...
*  I'm thinking of saying this, how much would you pay me not to say it? And I'm not going to collect the bribe.
*  So I'm blackmailing you in that story. And in the way economists use the utilitarian framework is everything's a form of that calculus.
*  So the Grand Canyon, the view of the Grand Canyon, is that a monetary transaction? Of course not.
*  But we can ask the question, how much would you pay to be able to continue to see the Grand Canyon for the rest of your life?
*  How much you pay for your children to be able to see it?
*  And that way I can trade that off in theory against other things and create a scale.
*  And the problem with that scale, of course, as every good economist knows and many bad ones don't, is that the scale depends on how much money you have.
*  It's not a real scale of pleasure and pain. It's a scale for me.
*  So my ability then to compare my cost and benefits to yours is, I think, zero.
*  But as economists, we don't like that. We want to aggregate. We want to be able to say this is good policy because the net gains are positive or this is a bad policy.
*  The net gains are negative. Does that do you agree with that?
*  I would put it this way. Insofar as we can aggregate and to make a choice, a policy choice, you have to aggregate in some manner.
*  But I think we aggregate by making moral judgments about different kinds of well-being.
*  And in this sense, utilitarianism is parasitic on non-utilitarian moral theories about which pleasures and pains we count and for how much and even how we understand what pleasure is.
*  It's not a simple physiological definition as a unidimensional measurable variable.
*  So it's all to me parasitic on pluralistic moral value theory, which makes me not a Benthamite.
*  And I think Mill understood this.
*  I think he's a wonderful thinker. And if you read more of him, you'd be very impressed.
*  OK, I'm going to let you create a reading list for me. Not a very long one, Tyler, though.
*  But you give me 25 pages to start with that I may have missed.
*  I want to just go back to that for a second, if I could.
*  And since this is my program and it's not really it's ours today.
*  So I'm semi-host today, but I want to ask you this.
*  When I think about about marriage, you know, and I'm my advisor is Gary Becker.
*  His theories of marriage, his mathematical models of marriage.
*  Do you think it's a reasonable thought to compare two people as potential mates for yourself, oneself?
*  In other words, if you marry, let's suppose a person is considering two different spouses and you choose one.
*  And they are willing to marry you.
*  And as economists who say, well, there's revealed preference.
*  You pick the one you thought was better for you.
*  How would you begin to conceptualize what better means in that context?
*  And I think the risk and I think that the easy way to think about it is more fun, fun broadly defined,
*  meaning day to day life will be better with this person than than the other person.
*  That's that's my expectation.
*  And I think that's a bizarre.
*  And the more I've thought about this, I'm happily married.
*  But this book I'm writing next called Wild Problems is about these kind of challenges.
*  Is it really a meaningful statement in the sense that there are so many different aspects of marriage and in life
*  and all kinds of choices we make like this that aren't about just what it's like to be around them.
*  It includes things like pride, include things like sense of purpose, include sense like meaning.
*  And when I take a job, I don't take the job that pays the most necessarily.
*  Take the job that I think will be the best, meaning a mix of non-monetary and monetary benefit.
*  Is it really a meaningful statement if one job gives me a huge amount of pride and the other I'm kind of embarrassed about?
*  And how do I do I really think I can trade those off and put a money, you know, a number on those?
*  Ultimately, a lot of the spent the my calculus to me is about this under this idea that we could put a scalar, a single number after we've aggregated everything up.
*  But I think that's here. So I would put that tension with so many choices, including having kids.
*  You're choosing what kind of person do you want to be, which is fine identity.
*  But once you have two different possible persons, you could be two or more.
*  Which of those gets to do the ordinal choosing? That's indeterminate.
*  And that's another reason why I think pure utilitarianism, whether of the cardinal or ordinal variety, the self undercutting,
*  needs to pull in values from outside of the utility itself.
*  Yeah, that's the you know, we talked about this on the program with L.A.
*  Paul talking about the vampire problem right before your vampire looks pretty grotesque after your vampire.
*  It's fantastic. And what I've suggested, what I'm suggesting my new book is that, well, it might be fantastic.
*  And so her conclusion is rationality ill defined. Mine is, yeah, but I don't want to be a vampire.
*  It's kind of gross. I don't care how fantastic I think it's going to be.
*  It might be. And you get to live forever, I think, if you play your cards right.
*  I just think we bring in other other, as you say, other value systems into that calculus, which makes it I like that phrase.
*  I have a very easy question for you now.
*  If there's a conflict between the ethnic religious identity of Israel and the democratic nature of Israel,
*  what philosophic standard do you apply to resolve that conflict?
*  Easiest question of the hour. Right.
*  Oh, yeah. You just flip a coin, I think.
*  I talk about that in the book also, by the way.
*  There's a there's a beautiful poem by Piet Hein, where he says, and I've heard other people say,
*  you flip the coin so that you'll know what to root for.
*  And that tells you what you really want.
*  Piet Hein was a great science thinker, mathematician.
*  So here's this guy saying, oh, yeah, flip the coin so you can find out what your gut is really hoping for and use that to make the decision.
*  And that I read about that's part of what I'm interested in this book about.
*  But when I think about I think there's a really interesting tension that you're identifying, especially for a religious person.
*  I don't want to live in a theocracy, Jewish or otherwise.
*  I'm a big believer in competition to make the world a better place under some constraints, of course.
*  You know, Israel has.
*  I don't know, was it 30 years ago, 30 years ago, was everybody knew that Israel was going to struggle to stay a Jewish state because birth rates were low among the Jewish population.
*  They were high among the Arab Israeli population.
*  And soon Israel would be in this weird predicament of being a Jewish state where the Jews were a minority.
*  People did not foresee the fall of the Soviet Union and the influx of millions of Russian Jews into Israel.
*  So Israel's really kind of avoided the existential threats that would require a very, very non-democratic response.
*  But it's not a democratic place like America.
*  Any Jew can come live here if they can prove that they're Jewish, but much harder if you're not.
*  And it's not an open, you know, I'm a big fan of open borders, but I do want there to be a Jewish state.
*  So there's a there's an inconsistency there for me.
*  That's somewhat troubling.
*  But I'm happy to to maintain that the ethnic religious character that you referred to as a Jewish state.
*  And I have to say that, you know, it used to be when I was growing up, oh, that's pleasant.
*  You know, it's nice to have a Jewish state.
*  The last 10 years, the last five years, I've actually thought there really has to be a Jewish state.
*  We actually are living in a world where anti-Semitism was unimaginable.
*  Twenty years ago is now increasingly common or not surprising.
*  And I think it's scary.
*  The so-called Jewish question, you know, what's the Jews role in the world?
*  What's when they're not when they're a citizen of another country?
*  It's back and hard to imagine.
*  I'm shocked by it.
*  Are you surprised by that?
*  I know it doesn't touch you the way it touches me or my children.
*  But are you surprised that anti-Semitism is actually people get killed for being Jews in the United States?
*  Weird.
*  Didn't expect that.
*  Didn't think it could happen.
*  Doesn't happen very often.
*  I'm not paranoid about it, but it's surprising.
*  I would just say I have worked very hard over the last 20 years to try to root out recency bias and my expectations.
*  So fewer bad things surprise me than used to is how I would put it.
*  Because if you look at broader history, right, it's a pretty common event, as are many other bad things.
*  And we suffer from recency bias.
*  We think, oh, what we've seen over the 20 or 30 years where the centrality of our own growing up happened is somehow special.
*  But it's not.
*  Yeah.
*  Tomorrow will be like yesterday.
*  Yes.
*  Until it is.
*  I'm curious.
*  I got way overexcited about Theranos and way overexcited about driverless cars.
*  Is that same phenomenon?
*  Meaning all the hype and excitement that this was different, that they'd solved this problem, that there was going to be this new world, you know, that I'd call more of an optimism bias.
*  I wanted to believe that we'd, you know, solved, improved, transformed.
*  Did you fall prey to that?
*  Well, I think you were right to be excited about driverless vehicles.
*  They're not going to revolutionize the world tomorrow.
*  But I think that will happen within our lifetimes in a significant way.
*  Theranos I just wasn't paying that much attention to.
*  I have become successively less skeptical about longevity research.
*  I would say that.
*  But I think it's a long, slow haul and a tough slog.
*  So I don't have a utopian vision there.
*  But I think there's so much talent now working on those problems.
*  We'll make some progress on them.
*  Those would be my two responses.
*  It's hard to know.
*  I was just surprised that there were so many smart people, and I just got swept up in the excitement,
*  so many smart people who said, you know, within three years we're going to have driverless cars,
*  35,000 lives saved because there won't be any deaths on the highway.
*  True, there might be a few more pedestrians killed,
*  but it's going to be a huge advantage for improvement in human life.
*  And I think the technical problems there turned out to be quite a bit more daunting.
*  And I think a different kind of bias is we just sort of assume that technology and focus will solve anything.
*  And often it does.
*  Amazing.
*  You know, getting a vaccine in the weekend.
*  That was a great moment of human achievement.
*  Let me ask you another super easy question.
*  Let's say we think that under current circumstances,
*  a two state solution would not lead to security either for Israel or for the resulting Palestinian state.
*  Many people believe that.
*  Let's say also, as I think you believe, that a one state solution where just everyone votes would not lead to security for current vision of Israel or even a modified version of it.
*  And let's say also that the current reliance of the Palestinian territories on the state of Israel for protection, security, intelligence, water, many important features of life,
*  prevent electricity, those governing bodies from ever attaining sufficient autonomy to be a credible peace partner, guarantee of its own security and so on.
*  From that point of view, what do we do?
*  So we're not utilitarians, right?
*  So we're thinking about what's right and wrong.
*  What's the right thing to do?
*  It's an expression from the Talmud to answer something on one foot because you can't stand on one foot for very long.
*  So it just means, you know, for some people, it means you got 30 seconds.
*  There's some there's some base mopeds, you could probably stand on one foot for an hour or two.
*  But it usually means so you want to stand on one foot for an hour or two.
*  But it usually means so you want me to answer someone foot.
*  And of course, there's no there's no answer.
*  And I think I mentioned Michael Goodman a minute ago for his book, The Wonder, The Wandering Jew, his other fascinating book called Catch 67,
*  which explores the contradictions and inconsistencies with different worldviews toward the conflict between Israeli,
*  Israeli, and the Palestinians in an incredibly thoughtful way.
*  I recommend that book.
*  It's the best book you can read about about what's going on here politically and intellectually and emotionally.
*  It's a phenomenal book.
*  So even though part of his insight is it's wrong to look for a solution.
*  If I remember the book correctly, I read it quickly.
*  But think about ways to live with it.
*  Think about ways to make life better.
*  Think about ways to move toward improvement rather than fixing it.
*  And I think the American political, the American foreign policy establishment has spent the last decades just trying to, quote, fix it.
*  And it may not be fixable.
*  It's hard to admit that as a as a rational person.
*  It's hard to admit it as a person who lives here.
*  By the way, I should just mention people have written me in the last month saying, you know, is it scary here?
*  Is it would you be afraid to raise your children there if you had young children?
*  It's an incredible place to raise children.
*  Children here run free without fear.
*  They play in a way that American children are used to be allowed to play.
*  I played that way growing up.
*  It's still true here.
*  There's very little crime on the streets, very little street crime, very little theft, very little burglary and so on.
*  But there is threat of terrorism.
*  So you're much more likely to get stabbed in Jerusalem than you are in New York City.
*  But of course, it's not common.
*  Thank God, at least so right now.
*  But it's it's serious.
*  And then you got Iran and it's as I alluded to earlier, it's tough neighborhood.
*  So I think it behooves if I may use a word that's out of fashion, it behooves us all to think about ways to both reduce the security threat to Israel and to improve the lives of the people.
*  Who, of course, in the West Bank and Gaza and elsewhere, who?
*  It's they're not very good democracies, even though sometimes their elections.
*  I don't necessarily believe that the person on the street there is being I don't know what their attitudes are.
*  They can't give an honest answer out of fear.
*  So I wouldn't rely on survey data.
*  I think there's certainly a lot of people in those parts of the world.
*  Our neighbors here are cousins who just want to lead a normal life and have a better life for their children, like most people aspire to.
*  So how do you improve that?
*  I would love to have more commercial interaction, although I agree with you.
*  The trade is not a panacea.
*  Or does that mean it is a panacea?
*  I can't remember.
*  I've got that word.
*  I've troubled with that word.
*  I think I actually I think there used to be more commercial interaction between the Palestinian population and Israel because it was more peaceful.
*  And now that it's the threat of terrorism is there, Israel's walled off its borders to those neighborhoods and those parts of the world, Gaza and because it's scary.
*  And that's tragedy.
*  I just and they live horribly there.
*  It's a very tough place to live, Gaza.
*  Egypt's not very nice to me either, by the way.
*  They have closed border with Egypt.
*  So I think the challenge is to find ways.
*  I don't think you know, I don't think it's it's the real problem right now is Israel does have a negotiating partner who thinks that Israel has a right to exist.
*  So Hamas doesn't recognize Israel's right to exist.
*  It's hard to imagine a two state solution with that.
*  So how do you improve things along the way?
*  I think you look for ways to do some commercial interaction.
*  I think the other thing is reminds me a little bit of I'll say it this way.
*  This is the Middle East.
*  There are cultural norms here that are not the same as in America.
*  I think a lot of Americans have no understanding of that.
*  Certainly American Jews don't.
*  I don't think American negotiators understand it so well, probably.
*  The role that pride face dignity plays as opposed to say narrow quote narrow self interest narrowly defined.
*  I think it's much greater for those other intangible things.
*  And personally, I'd like to see Israel try a different kind of move toward normalcy.
*  But I also understand that I'm naive and have only lived here six months and have very little thoughtful to say about that.
*  That I would want anyone to pay attention to it because it's a different neighborhood than where I came from in Maryland.
*  And it's not easily understood.
*  And what might be seen as a generous gesture in Maryland might be seen differently here and vice versa.
*  Something that's harsh in Maryland might be seen very differently here.
*  And so Israel has its own cultural Israelis have their own cultural baggage, not just that they're part of this Middle Eastern culture that they share to some extent with their neighbors.
*  Israelis are very proud of their self reliance.
*  I'll tell you a story.
*  I once this is again, I've only been here six months, but this is an old story.
*  It tells you something.
*  I'm kind of flying out of JFK.
*  I have to get to Israel to visit one of my kids who's studying here for this for the year.
*  There's a special program for the parents and small window for me to get here in time to enjoy the program with my son.
*  And JFK is every flight's canceled.
*  It's it's snowing just this relentless hour after hour blanketing the city.
*  And I leave Midtown Manhattan to go to JFK.
*  And the flight still I fly to an L.L. the Israeli airline is still not canceled somehow.
*  But I can't the cab can't go faster than 20 miles an hour.
*  So it takes about there's no one on the road.
*  It's like me.
*  The cabs, the only car on the road, takes us about 45 minutes or an hour to get to JFK.
*  And 20 miles an hour.
*  And I get to the gate, the desk to check my bags.
*  And they ask me the security questions, which I'll all does differently than anybody else.
*  And they take my bag and I get to the front desk and I say, you know, to get my boarding pass.
*  And they say, can I help you?
*  I said, yeah, I'm on flight such as such.
*  And I said, we're not leaving tonight, are we?
*  We're not really going to fly this.
*  I mean, it's like it's going to be canceled.
*  I'm two hours early.
*  Right. And still going to keep snowing the whole time.
*  And she looks at me and she says, you know, our pilots are they're all from the Israeli Air Force.
*  And the rule here is it's the pilots call if they can can't they can decide they're uncomfortable flying and cancel flight anytime.
*  So she said, as long as the airport's open, we're going to fly because those those pilots, they're going to fly.
*  They're confident that they can fly through that storm.
*  And, you know, there's something beautiful about that.
*  Something scary. It's a little bit.
*  It was really exciting because I wanted to get to see my son.
*  But they can. I don't know if that's always my mentality.
*  But that's the Israeli mentality.
*  We'll get it done. We'll take care of it.
*  It'll work out. And it's a pretty.
*  You know, we're joking a lot, not joking, but we're talking around these issues of bluntness and and this culture here.
*  But there's also some there's a vitality and national pride here that's so missing in America these days.
*  And I'm very worried about the future of America.
*  And it's a different set of worries here, but they're not bad words.
*  Well, for what America is dealing with, it feels like.
*  Are you optimistic about the future of America as a as a country?
*  I would put it this way. I'm increasingly optimistic about economic issues, technological issues, and even American democracy, contrary to most people.
*  But I am increasingly worried about the possible collapse of geopolitical stability in places such as Taiwan, Ukraine, parts of Africa.
*  So I'm not sure if I'm optimistic or pessimistic as a whole.
*  I'm relatively optimistic about North America compared to the rest of the world for sure, because it's geopolitically.
*  Sure. Right. Wow.
*  Because it can't be evaded. And it has enough of its own resources.
*  Right. If we were cut off, we would in different ways manage.
*  Of course, we could destroy ourselves from within.
*  I'm now wearing putting my American passport. I'm still American citizen also with the way we could.
*  I always ask people, are you short the market? And they never say yes.
*  There's a lot of hemming and hawing.
*  But I think it's become a kind of protective talisman to over worry about American democracy because people feel angst about the content of what it's producing, which a lot of that I would agree with.
*  But I think it will continue. And American democracy has looked and sounded ugly for most of its history, getting back to recency bias.
*  And maybe it sounded better in the 80s and 90s. But for American democracy to be lunacy is in fact part of our history.
*  But let me close with two final questions. One is super easy. The other is very hard. The easy question.
*  All right. Sure. Can I have the easy one first?
*  It seems to me Israel faces a pending or even current shortage of unskilled labor and is also committed to the idea of being a Jewish state.
*  And countries like Switzerland that I never thought would take in a lot of outsiders have done so because it makes economic sense.
*  So how will Israel address this question? That's the easy one.
*  That's the easy one. Oh, great. Is everything going to be robots and driverless cars? But you don't believe in those anymore. So who does all the work?
*  No, I think robots are pretty powerful. Yeah, but we're not going to have driverless cars for a while. We're going to still have drivers.
*  You know, I think that again, I'm a newcomer. There's a lot of debate here that I've not been paid close attention to before I arrived about immigrants from other countries.
*  There's a lot of people here from Asia who do some of the jobs that Israelis don't want to do at market wages here.
*  And there's people from Eritrea and other places. And it's really a national identity issue, right?
*  That the Israeli people will work out through their really complicated and not so perhaps robust democracy. Pretty robust.
*  You know, it's 70 years now. It's pretty amazing. Heading towards 75.
*  But I think it's a bit of a fallacy. I know you don't subscribe to it, but a lot of people do that.
*  Oh, well, if we don't import workers to do those jobs, no one will do them. And that's not true.
*  What will happen is if you have something of a market economy, the wages rise and they become more attractive to the native population.
*  Now immigrants aren't needed. And some of the things with the prices rise so much, they won't be done anymore.
*  People won't want them at those higher prices it would take to pay for those services.
*  So I don't think it's a there's a temptation always to look for the efficient solution, the one that's financially wise.
*  But there are other aspects. And I think.
*  You know, Brexit and other decisions that that populations are making in the in the modern world are a view that there are things more important than money.
*  And I don't I don't think that's ever going to change. I think, as I've said before, a good economist understands that a bad economist focuses on it.
*  An episode when it's coming out, I come out before this.
*  I think it's before this with Megan McArdle on Roger Scruton's book, Where We Are, which is about the role that place plays in our emotional well-being and our heart and our decision making.
*  And I think those things are really important and people care a lot about them, especially here in Israel.
*  You know, their connection to the land, their connection to their country, their sense of identity that we alluded to earlier that that I think is extremely important here.
*  So I think Israel make the decision they might they might be willing to pay a price.
*  Israelis might be willing to pay a higher price for a bunch of stuff to have it done by Israeli sources or not get done at all.
*  You know, America's got that same issue, right? It's the same challenge.
*  A lot of people like the idea of inexpensive.
*  Food, fruit and vegetables picked by inexpensive labor, home repairs done by inexpensive labor, all immigrant, often illegal, perhaps.
*  And a lot of people like that.
*  A lot of people like what comes with that, which is more interesting life, more interesting types of people.
*  But some people don't like it. And the fact that they're going to pay a higher price for some things, that doesn't surprise me that they that they're willing to make that right.
*  And here's the hard question. And it's hard because you actually have to solve it in your new job.
*  What is your next task? Yeah.
*  Oh, that's what you have to do. It's much harder than the others.
*  But I have to do it by myself and I don't have to pretend I understand something I don't understand, like, you know, preventing warfare among people who've been fighting for a long time tragically.
*  The thing I really have to do is that in about one hour, we have our first gala dinner here of alumni, which we haven't had because of COVID.
*  It's amazing thing right now in Israel, right?
*  We've closed this is December 2021. We've closed our borders to the United States, which means that my youngest son can't come visit us for winter break like he planned to.
*  A lot of people can't come to their kids, their grandchildren's lifecycle events.
*  And until I'd say about a month ago when Omicron was just a glint in somebody's eye or throat, people here are living a totally normal life.
*  I mean, it's just totally normal. We have these we have this we have these mask mandates, which which like on the buses, you're supposed to wear a mask.
*  Even the drivers not wearing his mask. Excuse me. They're all wearing it. Nobody's wearing it over their nose and mouth.
*  Very few. The older people are generally, but the younger people either wearing it under their chin, maybe a little over their mouth, but not their nose.
*  And I think with Omicron, the level of anxiety has risen here.
*  Some I assume it's risen there where you are as well.
*  But we've got a gala dinner tonight and and and there's going to be 125 alums.
*  So this place we've only had five years of graduates. So that's the first thing I'm doing. But that's not really your question.
*  What am I doing that I can share that's not too secretive or important?
*  I'll tell you another thing we're doing, which is glorious. Leon Cass is our new dean of faculty.
*  And he's convened a he's he's 82 taught the great books at the University of Chicago and St. John's for over three decades.
*  Often with his wife, Amy is his past who's passed on, but who was an incredible teacher also.
*  And Leon's just an incredible visionary educationally.
*  So one of the thrills of this job is sitting in on the faculty colloquium, which he started and listening to my colleagues, my faculty members,
*  like saying my our faculty members talk about a text that they love.
*  And we have a faculty member of Safambar. He's a great Israeli novelist, at least I hope so.
*  I can't read his books are in Hebrew. They haven't been translated yet, but they're popular, I think among the right people.
*  And anyway, he was he taught a class last week and a half ago, and he chose a poem by Yates.
*  And the poem was after a long silence. And I'm a Yates fan.
*  I love Yates. And I picked up this poem and I looked at it and I thought, I have no idea what this poem's about.
*  It's trouble. And then I read it again before the colloquium, get anything out of it again.
*  And for 90 minutes, we studied it with other faculty members from all different departments.
*  And I got some light, a lot of light, actually. It's a beautiful poem.
*  It doesn't it doesn't have much rhythm to it. It rhythms disjointed.
*  There's some lines that are amic pentameter, some aren't.
*  And Asaf said, this is Yates. Don't you think he did that on purpose?
*  You know, you don't like the rhythm of the poem. Maybe you ought to think about whether this is part of the poem.
*  So it was an amazing, glorious experience.
*  That's my favorite thing about working here that and going to choir practice with the students here and pretending I can sing.
*  I'm looking forward to seeing him tonight. So it's kind of a cheap ducking of your question, but it's the best I can do, I think.
*  Russ Roberts, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Tyler.
