# Tyler Looks Back on 2019 (BONUS) | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78)
*  Hi everyone, this is Jeff, producer of Conversations with Tyler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the end of the year and today we're doing a special retrospective episode. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=7.76s)]
*  So I sat Tyler down in the studio and we reflected on the past year of the show. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=12.24s)]
*  We talk about how Tyler's production function has changed in the past year, which guest [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=17.04s)]
*  was the most challenging for him to prep for, most popular episodes, most underrated conversations. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=21.26s)]
*  I also challenged Tyler to several rounds of a segment I called Name That Production Function. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=26.68s)]
*  We took your questions from Twitter. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=31.02s)]
*  I went back to Marginal Revolution in December 2009 and asked Tyler how he thought his picks [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=32.36s)]
*  held up from then for best books and movies. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=37.56s)]
*  It's a great conversation, I really enjoyed it, and I hope you also enjoy this peek behind [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=40.6s)]
*  the scenes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=45.6s)]
*  Before we get to it, the last thing I'll say is that if you'd like to support the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=46.8s)]
*  show before the end of the year, please go to conversationswithtyler.com slash donate [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=50.5s)]
*  On behalf of me and the rest of the Conversation with Tyler team, we really appreciate it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  Thank you and enjoy this special end of year retrospective. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I love going to a hotel, often a bad one, when all they have is cereal and then I can [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=85.16s)]
*  have it again and I don't have to feel guilty and I won't have it any other time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=100.44s)]
*  Actually one of my questions for you, Tyler, was what your favorite sort of packaged grocery [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=106.44s)]
*  store item is. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=113.08s)]
*  I know you love chocolate and you have sort of things you eat, but if you were kind of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=114.42s)]
*  buying a packaged good off the shelf in a grocery store, what's your favorite thing? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=118.28s)]
*  The funny thing is I don't really buy any packaged goods. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=123.58s)]
*  So I hardly buy any canned goods. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=128.1s)]
*  I love Goya small white beans. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=129.78s)]
*  I cook them with chili and I love Goya small red beans. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=132.34s)]
*  I cook them with Mexican dishes, but I'll buy fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, cheese, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=135.58s)]
*  and very little processed or packaged. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=142.86s)]
*  I can't even think offhand. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=144.74s)]
*  If you count smoked trout wrapped in plastic, that's a kind of package, but it's still [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=146.66000000000003s)]
*  basically buying fish. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=151.5s)]
*  Yeah, so you follow the typical, the kind of healthy advice where you stay around the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=153.02s)]
*  perimeter of the grocery store and you're in the fresh fruits and you're in the meats, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=156.9s)]
*  but you're not in those interior aisles where they typically are stocking the candy bars [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=161.06s)]
*  and potato chips and things like that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=165.3s)]
*  That's right, but I'm not sure it's motivated by health. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=167.74s)]
*  I just like the other items better. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=169.78000000000003s)]
*  You said cereal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=172.98s)]
*  So is cereal one of those foods for you that you would, you indulge at it at hotels, but [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=173.98s)]
*  you won't buy it for yourself now? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=178.66s)]
*  I don't buy it ever and I only indulge at it in bad hotels. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=180.38s)]
*  Like if I'm staying in Menlo Park where the hotels are bad, unless you're paying a lot, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=185.66s)]
*  and they'll just have like cereal and bad eggs and bacon. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=190.34s)]
*  I'll just have the cornflakes, but it's so delicious. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=193.5s)]
*  And to do that five times a year makes me very happy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=197.66s)]
*  So this is a story I think is known at Mercatus as part of the lore of Tyler is that when [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=200.62s)]
*  you were studying in Germany, you had someone ship you cereal. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=206.38s)]
*  This is before you had your awakening. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=211.34s)]
*  Tell us that story. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  I think you can get away more with eating cereal when you're younger, but I had a favorite [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  cereal which then was product 19 and it was very hard to get in Germany. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  The only place you could get it was at American Army bases and then you had to pretend to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=223.78s)]
*  be part of the American Armed Services, which involved costs of its own. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=227.98s)]
*  So one very nice person working at Mercatus sent me a bunch of boxes of product 19. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=233.06s)]
*  This is the first Mercatus export maybe in a way was Tyler Cowan and product 19. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=238.98s)]
*  That's correct to Germany. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  So when was that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=246.57999999999998s)]
*  That must have been 1984, possibly 85, 85 I think. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  When was your awakening in terms of food? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=251.26s)]
*  So it wasn't in Germany. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=253.94s)]
*  That was okay. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  So I was starting to experiment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=256.78s)]
*  I think I was 23 when I went in graduate school and then I got to Germany and everything was [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=258.58s)]
*  different. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=263.14s)]
*  So if you're thrown out of your status quo, you'll experiment with many other things too. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=264.14s)]
*  I think that's an interesting general principle. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=269.05999999999995s)]
*  People don't experiment enough with their own lives and you'll find yourself trying [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  things that were not part of the initial experiment. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=275.94s)]
*  That's what Germany did to my food life. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  So I started trying, say, Korean food, which I hadn't had before. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  I don't even know that it was that good in Germany, but I didn't know. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=286.18s)]
*  And it's like, I'm not going to eat German food every day. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=289.06s)]
*  So let's try, you know, bulgogi. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=293.58s)]
*  I think my first Indian food was when I was living in Germany. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=294.58s)]
*  And how was it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=297.14s)]
*  I just remember it in my mind. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  It was the first time I'd had a curry. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=300.86s)]
*  So it was pretty tasty. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=302.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=303.74s)]
*  And it was one of my favorite things. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=304.74s)]
*  And I thought this is amazing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=305.74s)]
*  And it just happened to be in Germany. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=306.74s)]
*  So my experience bears it out a little bit too. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=308.78s)]
*  Some of the things you mentioned about physical space and experimentation are going to come [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=311.62s)]
*  up. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=315.12s)]
*  So we've already gotten started. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=317.12s)]
*  For those of you who don't know, I'm Jeff Holmes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=318.48s)]
*  I produce Conversations with Tyler. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=320.32s)]
*  I'm joined with our host Tyler. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  And we're going to do sort of a year in review and talk about the show. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=324.52s)]
*  But go beyond. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=327.2s)]
*  It's the end of a decade. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=328.2s)]
*  And we've never done this before. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=329.2s)]
*  So I'm going to go a little further afield. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=330.56s)]
*  If you like this segment, we'll do it more. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=332.8s)]
*  So let me know. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=335.92s)]
*  Let Tyler know. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=336.92s)]
*  But I thought it was a great time here at the end of the year to look back on the state [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=337.92s)]
*  of the podcast. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=341.72s)]
*  We're going to do a few things. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=342.72s)]
*  We're going to look back at past episodes, talk about them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=344.04s)]
*  We're going to do a segment I like to call Name That Production Function, which I'm very [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=347.76000000000005s)]
*  excited about. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=351.6s)]
*  And then I've actually looked back at Marginal Revolution from 10 years ago. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm very curious to hear your thoughts about the productivity and the changes in [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  Marginal Revolution in the past decade. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  I will fail all of the memory tests. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  But first- [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=368.44s)]
*  I'm very focused on the next podcast, just to be clear, as my producer tells me to be. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=369.44s)]
*  Yes, well, that is the prime directive for Conversations with Tyler. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=374.0s)]
*  We're here at the end of the year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  Actually all of our episodes through the end of the year have been recorded, but we do [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=379.76s)]
*  have always more in the queue, more in the pipeline. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  Your prep is as intensive as ever. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=386.64s)]
*  How many total this year do you have a count? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=388.44s)]
*  Nearly 30. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=391.32s)]
*  Wow, that's a lot. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=392.32s)]
*  This is the second year that we- so starting last year, we started the Every Other Week, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=393.32s)]
*  and then we usually have a few bonus episodes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  So this year, that was True to Form as well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=400.32s)]
*  So we do at minimum now 24, and then usually there's a little bit extra. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=402.96s)]
*  And so as you look back over those episodes and you have the list in front of you, what [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=406.96s)]
*  strikes you about it? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=412.64s)]
*  Can you keep up the pace? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=414.08s)]
*  I think I can. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=415.52s)]
*  I felt it was an incredible year. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=416.64s)]
*  Our best guests, maybe the most diverse group, a very few week episodes, and for me, basically [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  a thrill each time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=424.96s)]
*  People I thought I'd never have a chance to do a podcast with, and here they are. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  Have you had to adapt your research process to accommodate more guests? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=430.94s)]
*  And I think we have more guests on that you're not as familiar with, that you can't just [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=436.14s)]
*  rely on a base knowledge. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=439.34s)]
*  You really do have to kind of get in at a ground level, not just read everything they [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=440.86s)]
*  know, but maybe get more of the contextual work down. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=445.18s)]
*  Have you adjusted or you just- you go for it and you've just had to shift other priorities? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=448.14s)]
*  I've had to shift other priorities. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=452.86s)]
*  Economists are the easiest to prep for. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=455.34s)]
*  In principle, you could try doing it with no prep. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=458.22s)]
*  Ed Boyden was one of the hardest because he studies the brain, and even Ed will tell you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  we don't understand the brain. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=465.66s)]
*  So if Ed doesn't understand the brain, how well do you think I understand the brain? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=467.18s)]
*  But I still have to ask him some questions. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=471.26s)]
*  Can I ask a card? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=473.42s)]
*  I had to revisit a lot of Norwegian literature, which I had already read, but that wasn't [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=474.42s)]
*  actually very easy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=479.58000000000004s)]
*  That was an especially difficult prep. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=481.06s)]
*  And anytime I have to read fiction, which I just read slower. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=483.42s)]
*  It's not the fault of the author, but Neil Stevenson was a very difficult prep. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=486.62s)]
*  Long books. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=490.86s)]
*  Long books. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=491.82s)]
*  And you can't just breeze through them because like you've absorbed the material in some [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=493.1s)]
*  other capacity. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=497.34000000000003s)]
*  And then Jordan Peterson's a hard prep. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=498.86s)]
*  Not that he's written that much, but there's so much of him on YouTube and you can only [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=501.02s)]
*  listen to it that quickly and you've got to decide what am I going to do about this guy? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  And at some point you just drop it and you put your energy into thinking through how [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=509.1s)]
*  should the conversation actually be. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=513.66s)]
*  But the hardest prep of all was Emily Wilson, who translated Homer. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=515.74s)]
*  And in a way that was mainly one book, but it was one book I had to read about five times. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=520.7s)]
*  And it's a very hard book. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=525.98s)]
*  So that was like the single killer prep for me during the year. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=527.5s)]
*  And that was very rewarding, but that was tough. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=531.02s)]
*  Let me give you a rundown of the stats. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=533.58s)]
*  So do you have a sense of what was the most popular podcast this year? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=535.42s)]
*  No idea whatsoever. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=538.62s)]
*  Are you allowed to tell me? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=539.98s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=541.58s)]
*  I'm benchmarking this in the first week of release to sort of. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=542.78s)]
*  To control for life, to control for release age. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=546.22s)]
*  But the most popular podcast in the first week was Jordan Peterson. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=549.26s)]
*  Not surprising. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=552.78s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=553.74s)]
*  Jordan Peterson was by far the most downloaded in the first week. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=555.02s)]
*  That was closer to his popularity peak than today. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=559.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=562.46s)]
*  And I thought a very good conversation because I've reviewed the conversations leading up to this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=563.18s)]
*  And I was surprised at how, you know, Jordan, as you say, Jordan Peterson, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=569.5s)]
*  very exposed person, a lot out there, but I found a lot of what he said very good. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=574.54s)]
*  And it was actually a conversation. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=579.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=582.14s)]
*  Which is not always the case. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=582.38s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=583.3399999999999s)]
*  And I really did. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=584.2199999999999s)]
*  I thought his comments on fame and having to be careful. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=585.8199999999999s)]
*  I thought he revealed something about himself that was very interesting. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=589.26s)]
*  I encourage everyone, if you're new, you should definitely check that out. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=592.78s)]
*  Do you have a sense of what might be the most underrated conversation? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=596.3s)]
*  If you look here and you think about our typical listenership and one they may have skipped, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=600.86s)]
*  I have my answers. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=605.74s)]
*  I'm curious to hear yours. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  Most underrated. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=608.62s)]
*  I suppose I think that's going to be Knausgaard, who was brilliant, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=610.3s)]
*  but highly literary and very much into things Norwegian. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  So my guess is that did not get the number of listeners it deserved. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=617.5s)]
*  But I'll defer to you. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=621.42s)]
*  You've got the data. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=622.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm not equating it necessarily with listens, but that is true. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=623.74s)]
*  I think Knausgaard underperformed relative to the quality of the conversation and how [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=627.42s)]
*  well he is known within literary circles. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=632.86s)]
*  And for me, Knausgaard was also a highlight. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=635.74s)]
*  It was fun also just to record that it was in London. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=638.78s)]
*  He left his black bread. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=642.78s)]
*  He left his bread. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=644.22s)]
*  And we got to eat it, right? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=645.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=646.62s)]
*  It's like, I'm eating Knausgaard's black bread. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=646.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=649.02s)]
*  He came in, he left, it was actually a bag of pastries. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=649.5799999999999s)]
*  And we realized too late that he left them. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=653.74s)]
*  Apparently this is common for Knausgaard that he forgets things and leaves them behind. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=655.58s)]
*  You confiscate the food for all of our guests and producers. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=660.0600000000001s)]
*  We divvied it up amongst you, your wife, and myself, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=665.1s)]
*  and another producer who was sick and I don't think got to enjoy it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=669.34s)]
*  But I actually, one of those pastries I brought all the way back to the States [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=672.46s)]
*  and my wife even enjoyed one of Knausgaard's pastries. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  But I also love that conversation because he talked about [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=680.3000000000001s)]
*  he talked about fatherhood and writing in a way that I found very, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=683.8199999999999s)]
*  very affecting as someone with a young child. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=688.06s)]
*  So even as someone who's never read Knausgaard, which is me, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=690.62s)]
*  I thought it was a great conversation. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=694.14s)]
*  The best part of that was his opening look, which is not on the audio or the transcript. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=695.66s)]
*  It was clear he's sick and tired of doing media. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=700.38s)]
*  And he got the first question and his eyes shifted as he realized [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=703.26s)]
*  this was going to be an actual conversation. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=707.18s)]
*  And that was maybe the CWT highlight of the year for me. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=709.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=712.78s)]
*  Was to see Knausgaard's eyes shift and just how quickly and how smartly he realized [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=713.18s)]
*  that he was in for something different. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=718.3s)]
*  It did not take him long. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=719.7399999999999s)]
*  Yes. This is, in editing these, we do take out pregnant pauses [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=721.0999999999999s)]
*  and people do stop to think that's something I do wonder, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=726.6999999999999s)]
*  I do know people wonder about is sometimes the conversation seems so fast paced. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=729.9799999999999s)]
*  And usually they are, but sometimes guests do take a moment and they think about something. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=734.3s)]
*  Do I do that? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=739.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't think Carter's saying, no, I don't edit them anymore. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=740.46s)]
*  I don't think we're cutting out pauses for you as much. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=745.02s)]
*  And actually, I think for guests, they don't have the time to regroup [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=748.0600000000001s)]
*  because you're so fast. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=751.34s)]
*  I've definitely heard that from guests that the pace has kind of thrown off for them. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=752.38s)]
*  But we try to leave in a hint of when there was a pause, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=757.1s)]
*  but we definitely condense and shorten. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=759.82s)]
*  So these people aren't always super humans. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  But I remember with Knausgaard in particular, as I recall, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=764.46s)]
*  he did take quite a bit of time after that first question to think, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=767.34s)]
*  and that wasn't reflected in the final product. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=772.5400000000001s)]
*  So which is the most underrated according to you? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=774.86s)]
*  I would say Knausgaard and the other one I would say is Emily Wilson. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=777.1s)]
*  I was going to say that. So we agree, actually. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=779.6600000000001s)]
*  And Emily was fantastic. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=781.74s)]
*  But Homer is not the biggest draw with our audience. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=783.5s)]
*  But she was perfect. She knows everything. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=786.94s)]
*  There was something just mellifluous about the whole rhythm of the dialogue. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=790.38s)]
*  And she is someone who has found a way to use Twitter effectively to market [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=795.02s)]
*  and story tell about her work as a translator. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=801.26s)]
*  And she's a great Twitter follow. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  So that's an underrated aspect of Emily Wilson. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=806.46s)]
*  So yeah, those would be probably my two top picks for underrated conversations. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=808.7800000000001s)]
*  As you look over any other reflections on the year, surprises for you, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=813.26s)]
*  like if you would have thought at the beginning of 2019 [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=817.34s)]
*  that we're going to have some of these people on, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  because some of them we know, some of them we don't. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=821.58s)]
*  They come very quickly. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=823.58s)]
*  Well, I didn't think Mark Zuckerberg would ask me. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=824.86s)]
*  That was a surprise. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=827.4200000000001s)]
*  I said yes. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=829.1s)]
*  That would be the biggest surprise. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=830.62s)]
*  The physical setting of the chat with Alain Berteau, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=832.7s)]
*  where the World Trade Center had been, that overlook site where all of New York [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=836.62s)]
*  was around with the open windows. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=840.62s)]
*  And as the chat proceeded, it turned to dark and the lights came out. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=842.7s)]
*  Again, the listeners have no sense of that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=846.86s)]
*  But for me, that was pretty incredible. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=848.5400000000001s)]
*  Yes, we were on top of One World Trade Center for that conversation. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=850.78s)]
*  And we did it right at sunset. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=853.74s)]
*  And it was a special event for that reason, the subject matter, the setting. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=856.3s)]
*  Kudos to our event producer for that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=862.14s)]
*  Caitlin Schmidt, she did a great job. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=864.38s)]
*  Margaret Atwood making fun of me. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=866.38s)]
*  And the art collection in Kwame Anthony at Pia's Home. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=868.3s)]
*  Those are two other very memorable moments. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=871.5799999999999s)]
*  And that will come up. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=873.9s)]
*  Actually, I'll use that to transition to a segment [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=875.02s)]
*  I'm going to slip in at various points in the conversation. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=877.74s)]
*  But we're going to do name that production function. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=880.78s)]
*  And we have music. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=882.94s)]
*  We're going to keep. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=883.74s)]
*  No, we don't have music. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=884.3s)]
*  So I've gone through. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=885.66s)]
*  And obviously, a recurring theme is that you ask about their production function. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=886.86s)]
*  Sometimes explicitly. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=890.94s)]
*  Sometimes it just comes up organically where they talk about how they do what they do. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=891.9s)]
*  So I've grouped them into different themes. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=895.98s)]
*  Before you do that, I just want to say it's one of my core views. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=897.98s)]
*  We should just study successful people more. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=901.42s)]
*  Like, how do they do this? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=903.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=905.26s)]
*  There's a very superficial version of that in the media all the time. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=905.82s)]
*  But like actually trying to figure out how they did it, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  to me is one of the most interesting topics. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=911.82s)]
*  On that question, when people give their production function, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=914.0600000000001s)]
*  how much do you believe they're aware of it? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=917.2600000000001s)]
*  Let's say for a CWT guest, how often do you think this is actually true [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=920.5400000000001s)]
*  or this is something they think but is not the true production function? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=924.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's untrue. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=927.4200000000001s)]
*  But I think on average, they're too modest. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=928.5400000000001s)]
*  And they're not quite willing to express their sheer ruthlessness [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=930.7s)]
*  at being successful in a way. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=934.3s)]
*  And the glee they take in that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=936.4599999999999s)]
*  So it's a biased estimate, I would say. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=938.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=941.02s)]
*  One of my things that I'm always curious to hear people name in a production function [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=942.06s)]
*  is the people that surround them that they have built a team around. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=945.5799999999999s)]
*  And sometimes it may be more of a leadership team, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=949.8199999999999s)]
*  but sometimes it might just be people who are very good at using producers, say, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=952.06s)]
*  or people like administrative assistants, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=955.3399999999999s)]
*  and how that plays into people's production function [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=958.06s)]
*  and allows them to focus on the things that really matter. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=960.38s)]
*  I know this is something that people talk about in academia, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=963.58s)]
*  some as well, that academics tend to get saddled with a lot of administrative work. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=967.0200000000001s)]
*  But honestly, I think one of the underrated aspects of any person's production function [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=970.94s)]
*  is the extent to which they can plug into an infrastructure [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=974.5400000000001s)]
*  and have certain things just not be a focus of worry for them. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=977.5s)]
*  And Ed Boyden saw that, but a lot of our guests didn't emphasize it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=980.86s)]
*  And I feel that's another bias. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=984.94s)]
*  By being excessively modest, they're in some bizarre way also being too egocentric. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=986.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=992.0600000000001s)]
*  They're not talking about, like, how am I good at building a team [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=992.46s)]
*  or letting someone else build a team around me? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=994.94s)]
*  Yes. Okay. So first theme, name that production function. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=997.26s)]
*  These are all related to several guests gave answers related to physical space. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1001.34s)]
*  So the first one, I have a very big desk from Ikea. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1006.94s)]
*  I have a huge orange cat who's mostly on it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1009.9000000000001s)]
*  I also have a couple of Greek dictionaries, Greek text. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1012.7800000000001s)]
*  Sounds like Emily Wilson, but that's a softball. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1016.14s)]
*  That's a softball. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1018.7800000000001s)]
*  So Emily Wilson really stressed having a big desk with a lot of text around it. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1019.98s)]
*  She translates Homer. You need a big desk to do that. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1023.5s)]
*  And a big orange cat. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1026.14s)]
*  And the cat, yes. And the Greek dictionaries. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1027.1s)]
*  Okay. Second person who emphasized physical space. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1029.42s)]
*  I almost always work on the column at the weekend in the living room of our house [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1033.34s)]
*  in another state. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1037.66s)]
*  In New Jersey. That's easy. That's up here. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1038.46s)]
*  Yeah. So he said I work for six or seven hours [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1040.6200000000001s)]
*  and he emphasized that he can't do certain work in certain spaces. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1043.66s)]
*  Like he has a study, but he doesn't do any work there. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1047.42s)]
*  Multiple locations are underrated. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1049.98s)]
*  I have two offices in Arlington and Fairfax. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1051.74s)]
*  I used to have three and I work a lot at home and I work a lot now on the road. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1054.3s)]
*  Yeah. Including going to these podcasts. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1059.1s)]
*  So that's four different locations. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1060.8600000000001s)]
*  On that question, particularly physical spaces working on the road. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1062.7s)]
*  Do you have any tips or tricks? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1066.7s)]
*  It's been maybe my biggest productivity boost in the last two years. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1068.54s)]
*  I've learned how to work on the road much better. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1071.74s)]
*  I think I was always pretty good at it, but now my productivity is maybe not even lower. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1074.22s)]
*  For most trips. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1079.98s)]
*  So I'm not sure what I did to get there. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1081.42s)]
*  Is it preserving the schedule or is it you've just figured out how to do work [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1083.34s)]
*  in incidental spots as you're traveling? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1088.46s)]
*  More the latter and learning greater flexibility. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1091.18s)]
*  So being able to write even if I'm not just writing early in the morning [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1093.42s)]
*  has been part of it. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1097.5s)]
*  Right. I feel like you have to go into two spaces. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1098.7s)]
*  You either have to try your best to preserve a schedule even when on the road [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1101.82s)]
*  or you have to get much, much better at just working where you can [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1106.38s)]
*  and not being precious about it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1110.5400000000002s)]
*  And I've done the latter without breaking my rigid schedule at home. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1112.14s)]
*  All right. So we'll go back to production function, but now we're going to, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1115.3400000000001s)]
*  let's do some listener questions. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1118.22s)]
*  So I asked, I asked for some questions on Twitter and I picked some of my favorites. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1119.8200000000002s)]
*  This is still the conversation I want to have. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1125.3400000000001s)]
*  So I did skip some. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1127.2600000000002s)]
*  All right. So we got some questions from Twitter. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1129.0200000000002s)]
*  Here's one. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1131.74s)]
*  Our former Mercatus scholar, Make America Boom Again advocate, Eli Durado. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1133.26s)]
*  His question was simply, what is it like being Tyler? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1138.3799999999999s)]
*  And this felt like an inside joke to me. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1141.82s)]
*  I don't know if it is, but I have an addendum to it as well. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1143.74s)]
*  So answer that question. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1146.3799999999999s)]
*  And then my follow-up to it would be, is there a difference in what it's like to be Tyler [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1147.6599999999999s)]
*  from 2009 to now? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1153.02s)]
*  How has it changed in the past 10 years? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1154.54s)]
*  I think I'm very calm and it's really quite rare that I have an unhappy day. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1156.78s)]
*  It's hard for me to remember one. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1161.8999999999999s)]
*  So this extreme evenness of temperament is actually a real thing. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1164.22s)]
*  And I guess that's what it's like being Tyler. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1169.02s)]
*  It has some downsides, but it's great for getting work done because your emotions are [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1171.34s)]
*  not distracting you from the task in front of you and it just happens. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1175.6599999999999s)]
*  So that's what it's like. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1179.4199999999998s)]
*  Part of what it's like being Tyler. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1180.7s)]
*  I've never, I've never witnessed a Tyler tirade. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1182.3s)]
*  I think you never will. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1185.58s)]
*  I was a Tyler fan for many years, started reading Marginal Revolution probably in 2006 [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1188.3799999999999s)]
*  probably. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1195.18s)]
*  And you know, they say don't meet your heroes. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1196.06s)]
*  That's always a concern, but I would say you are exactly as you appear to be [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1198.86s)]
*  and meeting you has been great and working with you has been great. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1203.5s)]
*  Thank you for the kind words. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1206.3799999999999s)]
*  That you are exactly how I think most people perceive you to be. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1207.5s)]
*  There is no other dark side of Tyler. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1211.8999999999999s)]
*  There is no Tyrone lurking in the shadows. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1214.14s)]
*  That's a problem perhaps, but I think it's an interesting question whether you should [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1217.26s)]
*  aspire to be better or worse than your public self and you can make an argument either way. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1221.8200000000002s)]
*  So there are people who are just incredible when you read their writing and when you meet [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1226.7800000000002s)]
*  them, there's nothing wrong with them, but you don't get anything extra out of meeting [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1230.8600000000001s)]
*  them. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1234.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1235.0200000000002s)]
*  And I guess I feel that's a worse way to be that if the person is better than the product, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1235.5s)]
*  maybe in some ways the product is worse, right? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1241.8999999999999s)]
*  It's easier to exceed a lesser product. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1244.3s)]
*  But nonetheless, philosophically, that's what I prefer in people is for the person [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1247.1s)]
*  to be better than the product. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1251.34s)]
*  You have your product as writings and your thoughts that are out in the web, but you [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1252.78s)]
*  still have not, I don't think most people would consider you overexposed still or they [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1258.9399999999998s)]
*  feel like they've gotten to the depths of Tyler. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1263.82s)]
*  And I think that maybe that time can come. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1265.98s)]
*  Maybe there is a limit, but I don't think we found it yet. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1269.58s)]
*  One thing Jordan Peterson figured out, it's one thing that made him successful, is there's [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1272.1399999999999s)]
*  a certain way in which on the internet you can't be overexposed, that if there's just [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1276.46s)]
*  a steady stream of you, it feels like being overexposed compared to the standards of 1987 [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1280.54s)]
*  or whenever. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1287.5s)]
*  But in fact, it's not and people are picking and choosing and you end up just dominating [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1288.54s)]
*  a particular space in a particular kind of way. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1293.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1295.8999999999999s)]
*  And I think most older people have not made that transition mentally to understanding [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1296.54s)]
*  how you should exist intellectually on the internet. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1302.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure it does feel like that to Jordan Peterson. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1305.58s)]
*  I feel like in 2006, 2007, I could go on YouTube and watch literally every video that existed [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1310.22s)]
*  of you and now I can't, but I also choose not to watch them. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1317.26s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing now if you would ask me 10, 12 years ago, oh, there's [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1321.82s)]
*  new Tyler content out and I still love it and I read Marginal Revolution every day, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1326.46s)]
*  but I also do that filtering myself that I like. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1332.14s)]
*  Well, I still have my canon or the core reading that I do and some of the other, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1334.54s)]
*  like one thing is I almost never read your Bloomberg columns. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1338.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's fine. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1341.74s)]
*  They're for a different audience. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1343.1000000000001s)]
*  And yeah, it's something that you something. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1344.38s)]
*  Well, how do you think about that difference? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1346.38s)]
*  Well, if you think about Bloomberg, the first tier of readers are those people who subscribe [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1348.14s)]
*  to the terminals, right? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1353.18s)]
*  And a lot of them, most of them are a finance audience. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1354.7s)]
*  They tend to be highly analytical, high income with a particular set of interests. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1358.22s)]
*  And I think it's fine. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1364.3000000000002s)]
*  Great to write for them. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1365.98s)]
*  I love them as an audience, but they're not like the blog audience or the CWT audience at all. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1366.8600000000001s)]
*  So you've got sort of a portfolio now you feel. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1374.0600000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1376.38s)]
*  How does the podcast fit into that? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1376.8600000000001s)]
*  Do you feel like you're reaching in a new or a bigger niche? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1378.38s)]
*  How does that sort for you? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1382.14s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know who I'm reaching. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1384.14s)]
*  When people see me in public, they now mention the podcast more than the blog. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1386.7800000000002s)]
*  So that tells me something. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1391.5800000000002s)]
*  But part of the strategy is in a way to ignore the audience. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1393.98s)]
*  And this is the conversation with person X that I want to have. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1397.26s)]
*  And it's true because that's the only reason to do it in a way. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1401.1000000000001s)]
*  Not an income earner. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1405.18s)]
*  Should people approach you if they see you or do you? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1406.46s)]
*  Depends who they are. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1409.42s)]
*  And if a listener to the podcast sees you in an airport or train station. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1411.1000000000001s)]
*  In the current equilibrium, I'm happy when they do. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1414.8600000000001s)]
*  But I'm not sure it would be true across all margins. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1417.82s)]
*  Do you have rules of etiquette that you want us to communicate here and now? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1420.14s)]
*  Say hello. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1424.7s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1425.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1426.54s)]
*  No reason not to. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1427.42s)]
*  Celebrities have to learn the rules here about you can say hello, but maybe no photos. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1428.22s)]
*  Whatever a person wants. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1433.5s)]
*  Okay, you heard it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1435.1000000000001s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1435.82s)]
*  But no, in the current equilibrium, right? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1436.54s)]
*  So the Lucas critique issue. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1439.1000000000001s)]
*  If you announce the current equilibrium is fine. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1441.74s)]
*  It's already shifted. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1444.06s)]
*  It's shifted already. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1444.94s)]
*  Okay, next question from Twitter. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1446.38s)]
*  This is from Benjamin Fisher. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1448.14s)]
*  Does Tyler have any thoughts on the legacy of Robert Crumb? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1449.5s)]
*  Do you know Robert Crumb? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1452.46s)]
*  You mean the comic books that the movie is about? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1453.5800000000002s)]
*  I've never really read them. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1457.3400000000001s)]
*  I saw the preview for that movie many times. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1459.3400000000001s)]
*  And somehow it didn't appeal to me. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1462.22s)]
*  And I haven't read comic books since I was a kid when I read a lot of DC comics when I was quite young. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1464.54s)]
*  And my interest with it has died there. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1471.34s)]
*  I'm not against it, but it just has not been a live thing for me. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1473.6599999999999s)]
*  Just like graphic novels are not a live thing for me. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1476.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1479.18s)]
*  I love the Sandman series by Neil Diamond, but most of them just they don't click with me somehow. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1479.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1484.62s)]
*  The fault is mine, I would readily admit. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1485.26s)]
*  All right, we're going to move off of listener questions and go back to production function. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1487.5s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1492.1399999999999s)]
*  All right, these are on writing habits. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1493.02s)]
*  First one, I've never written as much as I have after I got the children, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1495.58s)]
*  after I started to write at home, after I kind of- [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1499.66s)]
*  Knausgaard. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1502.06s)]
*  Knausgaard. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1502.86s)]
*  The Norwegian. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1503.5s)]
*  And as I mentioned, this was a part that really struck home with me. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1504.3s)]
*  He talked about trying to write and like literally lock himself in, you know, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1507.26s)]
*  a Nordic lighthouse or whatever it was. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1510.1399999999999s)]
*  But he established a routine in the middle of life. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1513.18s)]
*  And I like that so much that I put that as part of the title. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1515.82s)]
*  It became less religious for him, less sacred. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1519.82s)]
*  All right, so that was Knausgaard. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1521.82s)]
*  Second person, I certainly do not write every day and I don't think that's a bad thing. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1523.34s)]
*  I think it's sometimes good not to be purposeful in what you're doing, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1527.26s)]
*  you're distilling thoughts. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1530.54s)]
*  There's a lot of merit to allowing your thoughts just to meander in your head [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1532.06s)]
*  and make weird connections before you push them on the page. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1535.1s)]
*  I'm guessing a bit on this one, but Margaret Atwood? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1538.06s)]
*  That's McFarquhar actually. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1540.78s)]
*  McFarquhar, okay. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1542.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1543.58s)]
*  All right, next one. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1544.3799999999999s)]
*  When I first dreamed of being a writer, I thought I needed all these life experiences. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1545.58s)]
*  I needed to do running with the bulls, being alcoholic. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1549.18s)]
*  Now I think just the opposite. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1552.14s)]
*  There's plenty of stories out there. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1553.42s)]
*  The things to write about are all around you and you need to discipline yourself, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1555.3400000000001s)]
*  get your health right. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1558.22s)]
*  I tend to be very careful about what I eat. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1559.18s)]
*  I exercise, running, yoga, getting my body right. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1560.94s)]
*  It's not glamorous, but I feel like it benefits my work a lot. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1563.98s)]
*  Sounds like Neil Stevenson. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1567.1000000000001s)]
*  It's not Neil Stevenson. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1568.46s)]
*  It's not. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1569.5s)]
*  Who's your second guess? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1570.14s)]
*  It sounds like a fiction author. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1572.0600000000002s)]
*  Running with the bulls. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1574.7s)]
*  It's not fiction either. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1576.6200000000001s)]
*  Because who else would need to? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1578.54s)]
*  Ben Westoff. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1580.22s)]
*  Yeah, it was Ben Westoff. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1580.9399999999998s)]
*  Okay, a journalist. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1581.8999999999999s)]
*  Okay, last one. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1582.9399999999998s)]
*  This was one of my favorite answers of all production function answers. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1585.02s)]
*  I could not do what I do if I was not zealous in managing high quality inputs into my mind [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1589.02s)]
*  every day of my life. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1593.74s)]
*  That's why I spend maybe two hours a day writing. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1595.02s)]
*  I'm a writer. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1597.02s)]
*  Sounds like me. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1597.8999999999999s)]
*  But I spend three to four hours a day reading and two to three hours a day listening to music. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1600.1399999999999s)]
*  People think that's creating a problem, but I say no, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1604.7s)]
*  this is the reason I'm able to do this because I have constant good quality input. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1606.7s)]
*  That is the only reason I can maintain the output. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1610.8600000000001s)]
*  I think only Ted Joya would mention so many hours of music. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1613.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1616.78s)]
*  But it is also me. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1617.1000000000001s)]
*  That would completely apply to me. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1618.14s)]
*  He articulated something I think is very true of infovores generally, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1619.82s)]
*  but I haven't heard it I think on CWT yet is that idea that [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1623.5s)]
*  saving the time for the inputs is what allows you to do the thing. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1628.6200000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1631.66s)]
*  Music always having a role in what's going on as well. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1632.22s)]
*  Okay, back to some questions and we'll move on from production function. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1635.1s)]
*  Evie fellow llama, she asked you if you had a restaurant, what cuisine would you serve? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1640.06s)]
*  Oh, I think it would be food from central Mexico and I would cook it. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1645.26s)]
*  So that's my favorite food to cook like chicken mole is my best dish. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1649.4199999999998s)]
*  I think. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1654.9399999999998s)]
*  How long does it take you to make a mole? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1655.6599999999999s)]
*  I've gotten it down to about an hour's worth of labor time, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1657.82s)]
*  but it has to sit overnight so it's not ready in an hour. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1661.5s)]
*  But if I rush and do it perfectly, my part of it is done in an hour [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1664.78s)]
*  and then the sauce sits overnight and then the next day the chicken roasts [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1669.3400000000001s)]
*  for about an hour and five hour and 10 minutes. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1673.5s)]
*  So it depends what you count, but it feels like it takes an hour. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1676.78s)]
*  And what style is it? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1680.06s)]
*  Is it like a chocolatey mole or? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1681.42s)]
*  Chocolatey mole. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1683.3400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1684.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1684.7s)]
*  Another question from Mercatus scholar Emily Hamilton who works on affordable housing land use. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1685.1000000000001s)]
*  What do you think of fast casual architecture? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1691.5800000000002s)]
*  Have you heard that term? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1694.38s)]
*  I don't think I know the term. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1695.5s)]
*  What does she mean by that? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1696.8600000000001s)]
*  It's think of something like the Southwest wharf in DC where it's a big sort of master plan. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1697.9s)]
*  It's kind of this upper middle class development. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1704.7s)]
*  They bring a lot of higher end retailers. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1707.98s)]
*  You might have a whole foods. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1709.9s)]
*  You might have some fancy restaurants and it's all kind of part of this master plan. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1711.5800000000002s)]
*  Part of an urban design. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1716.38s)]
*  I find so much of America dispiritingly ugly, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1717.98s)]
*  but I've learned to prefer that that it keeps our minds open for other things. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1721.74s)]
*  And the towns that are in a way picture perfect like Kent or Bruges or Bergen, Norway, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1726.14s)]
*  where I just was that's stultifying. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1731.34s)]
*  So I guess I quite like fast casual precisely because I don't like it. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1734.3s)]
*  That if architecture is what is controlling your mind rather than music, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1738.78s)]
*  I suspect you'll end up in a worse place and you don't want your visual physical [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1744.3s)]
*  environment to be too perfect in any one dimension. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1748.22s)]
*  That that ends up stopping or halting your thinking in some way. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1751.26s)]
*  So to grow up in Paris, maybe now at this point is limiting. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1754.94s)]
*  I'm not saying it always was, but Paris is a completely static city at this point, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1758.3799999999999s)]
*  at least central Paris. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1762.7s)]
*  It's like, my goodness, it somehow can't be good for a public intellectual. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1764.06s)]
*  Another Twitter question. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1767.9s)]
*  This is from Vincenzo Luna. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1769.58s)]
*  What's the biggest change in the shortest period of time you've ever witnessed something either [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1771.5s)]
*  personally or professionally? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1775.74s)]
*  And he says, to clarify, I mean anything from a near instantaneous transformation, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1777.42s)]
*  or something that proceeded incrementally, but you saw from start to finish and you thought, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1782.7s)]
*  wow, that was amazing. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1786.46s)]
*  Well, the growth of China would be one example. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1787.98s)]
*  I'm not sure I can rank anything as the very most extreme, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1790.22s)]
*  but I first went to China 30 years ago and I've been there many times since. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1794.46s)]
*  And each time I go, my jaw drops. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1798.46s)]
*  And the difference between 30 years ago and today, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1800.7s)]
*  I even wrote a Bloomberg column about that you didn't read. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1802.94s)]
*  But the point got made. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1805.58s)]
*  It's really quite phenomenal. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1807.34s)]
*  That is one of my regrets is that I haven't visited China and the idea that you can see [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1809.1s)]
*  things changing almost in real time, which that's over there now. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1815.5s)]
*  I mean, it will still change a lot, but not at 10% rates of growth. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1819.82s)]
*  Back to production function questions. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1824.62s)]
*  This is kind of a grab bag one. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1827.1799999999998s)]
*  My father always told me when you travel, you don't look enough. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1829.26s)]
*  Every time he traveled a lot, he would say, I have not looked enough. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1833.1000000000001s)]
*  I've not looked enough. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1836.38s)]
*  This was ingrained in me all the time. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1837.5s)]
*  I think I have no idea on that one, but maybe the first part of his [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1841.3400000000001s)]
*  Elaine Berto, Elaine Berto. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1848.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1849.66s)]
*  That was a guess. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1850.06s)]
*  He, he emphasized that his, he would travel with his dad for business and his dad would [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1851.66s)]
*  more or less give him a map and say, here's some places to go. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1855.82s)]
*  And he would sort of report back and his dad would say, well, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1859.5s)]
*  I'm going to sort of report back and his dad would almost quiz him on what he had seen. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1861.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1864.62s)]
*  And he always got critiqued for not looking carefully enough or noticing enough. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1865.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1869.42s)]
*  Here's another one. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1869.74s)]
*  I keep a calendar of future plans. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1871.18s)]
*  Many people do, but then I also keep a calendar of the past, which logs how long it [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1873.26s)]
*  actually took for me to write that grant or to meet with that person or eat dinner or [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1877.82s)]
*  whatever. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1881.9s)]
*  Over time, I've learned a lot about how long it takes me to do something. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1882.7s)]
*  Is that it Boyden? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1886.22s)]
*  It was. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1887.26s)]
*  Who else writes grants, right? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1887.74s)]
*  He has a lab. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1889.1s)]
*  So that's how I figured that one out. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1889.98s)]
*  Not memory induction. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1892.3s)]
*  Boyden has a lot of great tips in his. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1893.9s)]
*  I could have selected any number of things, but he was one of the best for actually [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1895.98s)]
*  understanding how he succeeded. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1900.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1901.98s)]
*  And great, great insights into how you try to solve a problem, how you get a team to [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1902.3s)]
*  work together, like especially for an academic, but even just in terms of the full roster [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1907.26s)]
*  of CWT guests, I thought he was great on that stuff. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1911.5s)]
*  And I suspect the unedited Boyden would be so much better yet on administration [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1914.38s)]
*  personnel management, working within a university. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1919.66s)]
*  My goodness. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1922.5400000000002s)]
*  The things he could say. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1923.66s)]
*  All right, let's go to another theme in production functions. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1924.8600000000001s)]
*  Interestingly, two of our guests mentioned voice recording. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1928.3000000000002s)]
*  First, this is literally all this person said about it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1932.14s)]
*  They didn't elaborate, but I use voice recognition software and you were asking about [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1935.26s)]
*  how they produce their work. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1940.3000000000002s)]
*  This was very recent. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1943.18s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1945.26s)]
*  I don't think I have any idea who uses voice recognition software. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1946.94s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1951.4199999999998s)]
*  It's Doron Asimoglu. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1952.22s)]
*  And he gave it as an aside and it wasn't dwelled on or elaborated on, but that's what I keyed [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1953.8999999999999s)]
*  in on is that he said he basically, it sounded like he actually drafts his papers by essentially [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1959.1s)]
*  dictating. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1964.62s)]
*  By talking. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1965.02s)]
*  Gordon Tulloch did that, of course. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1965.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1967.1s)]
*  With a tape recorder, not with software. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1967.6599999999999s)]
*  And then he would have someone type it out. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1969.8999999999999s)]
*  On that note, second person. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1971.74s)]
*  Something like this person said they write in the morning and they stop at about 11. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1973.82s)]
*  As I'm walking around for the next 15 minutes or so, sentences will come into my head. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1979.1799999999998s)]
*  By and large, they're the best sentences. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1983.6599999999999s)]
*  So I've learned to carry a recorder with me. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1985.4199999999998s)]
*  Now it's just the voice recorder app on my phone because I know that if I jump in the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1987.58s)]
*  car and start driving somewhere, I'm going to have a few of those lines and I don't [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1991.34s)]
*  want to lose them. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1994.86s)]
*  Is that Russ Roberts? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1995.82s)]
*  No, that was Neil Stevenson. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1996.9399999999998s)]
*  Neil Stevenson. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1998.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1999.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1999.58s)]
*  I thought it was great that his mind is still working and he leaves the work, but he knows [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=1999.82s)]
*  some stuff is going to spit out. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2003.82s)]
*  Do you find yourself having to write notes or? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2005.74s)]
*  No, I don't write notes. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2009.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2010.22s)]
*  You just sit down, you write, and when you're done, that's it. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2011.18s)]
*  It's a discrete kind of thing. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2014.7s)]
*  And if I need to remind myself of something, I'll send myself an email, which is the worst [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2016.06s)]
*  possible way of managing your production function. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2021.02s)]
*  But it works. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2023.9s)]
*  To use your inbox as a to-do list, I think it's actually underrated. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2024.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2028.94s)]
*  Though I've read all the critiques. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2029.18s)]
*  I don't need to email myself much. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2030.94s)]
*  It's maybe one thing every three days and the rest I just remember. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2032.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2036.3s)]
*  One of my insights about you, I don't know if you would agree with this, but when I email [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2037.1s)]
*  with you, you're very responsive generally. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2041.42s)]
*  Like you'll respond. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2043.5s)]
*  If you're near a computer, you'll respond nearly instantly. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2044.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2048.14s)]
*  And then often there will be a flurry of emails, like as if a real-time conversation was happening. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2048.86s)]
*  And for me, oftentimes it feels like we're actually texting with each other, but you [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2055.2599999999998s)]
*  never text. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2059.2599999999998s)]
*  I never text. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2060.06s)]
*  I'm against texting. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2060.7799999999997s)]
*  You're against texting, but here's the thing, Tyler, you email like a texter. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2061.74s)]
*  But when you're emailing, you can type. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2065.8199999999997s)]
*  And when you text, you have a little phone, you have big thick fingers. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2067.74s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2071.8199999999997s)]
*  I actually, because I'm on a Mac, I can text from my laptop and I actually text a lot from [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2073.66s)]
*  my keyboard. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2079.02s)]
*  Well, then it's like emailing. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2080.06s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2081.2599999999998s)]
*  So if I got you hooked up with the technology, maybe you could be texting. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2082.14s)]
*  I don't see the advantage though, because with texting, you're in essence telling people [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2086.14s)]
*  they can jump a particular queue. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2090.62s)]
*  And I'm not sure why you would want to give them that right, rather than reserving yourself [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2092.62s)]
*  the ordering privilege for the emails. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2098.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2101.5s)]
*  So I always have my iPad and iPhone with me, so I can have as much immediacy as I want. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2101.8199999999997s)]
*  And why let people jump the queue? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2108.06s)]
*  Right. Yes. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2110.62s)]
*  This is the bane of texting, of Slack, something that it does create a presumption that you're [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2111.9s)]
*  kind of at the head of the line. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2117.42s)]
*  Now responding to all your emails right away, as I do, also creates that presumption, but [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2119.5s)]
*  somehow it feels different. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2124.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2126.3s)]
*  A few people talked about using social media as a tool, so we're still on production function. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2126.78s)]
*  So first person, I would say I read widely. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2131.34s)]
*  I play with a lot of ideas, most of which don't come to fruition. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2133.9s)]
*  Again, this is one of the advantages of social media. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2137.1s)]
*  Henry Farrell. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2139.58s)]
*  Henry Farrell. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2140.38s)]
*  And he talked about doing little micro threads on Twitter as a kind of experimental thing. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2141.18s)]
*  And he's very good at that, yes. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2144.94s)]
*  Yep. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2146.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2147.1s)]
*  Second one. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2148.14s)]
*  I'm killing me. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2150.22s)]
*  I'm losing my... [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2151.9s)]
*  You need to send yourself an email. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2154.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2156.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2157.66s)]
*  Second one. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2157.98s)]
*  That's what I mean when I say that spending time on Facebook is really part of my work. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2159.18s)]
*  I try to have a sense of the temperature of the air, the flavor of the conversation. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2163.82s)]
*  That's where social networks used strategically, I think, are extremely useful. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2167.42s)]
*  It's the kind of research tool that I didn't have as a young journalist. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2171.34s)]
*  Masha Gessen, of course. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2175.26s)]
*  I gave you the clue there at the end. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2177.26s)]
*  That I would have known. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2180.1400000000003s)]
*  I remember that passage quite well. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2181.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2183.42s)]
*  And she talked about, I thought was interesting, that a friend described her as an empty pot, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2183.9s)]
*  that she absorbs information and then it leaves her. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2188.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you find that true of yourself? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2191.58s)]
*  I mean, I think most people would say, no, you're a sponge and you keep it all in. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2193.26s)]
*  No, I feel I don't retain hardly any of it, that I can somehow summon it back if I cram on something. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2197.1800000000003s)]
*  But at any moment, I feel like I know nothing or close to nothing. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2203.9s)]
*  It's deep in there, but you have the tools to, you can't access it offhand, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2207.98s)]
*  but if you focus on it somehow that you know what's there. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2212.2200000000003s)]
*  It doesn't feel lost, but it doesn't feel on the tip of my fingers either. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2214.2200000000003s)]
*  Last one, this is a random one. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2217.9s)]
*  I played poker, I've played a lot of poker in college, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2220.38s)]
*  and I think I learned more about life and business from that than I learned in college. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2223.58s)]
*  I would not say I'm a great poker player, but I'm pretty good. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2227.26s)]
*  The thing that makes me, I think, good about that is getting good at quickly evaluating risk. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2230.46s)]
*  It's got to be Sam Altman, right? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2235.02s)]
*  It is. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2236.54s)]
*  Sam Altman. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2237.1s)]
*  Whose production function most clearly mirrors yours, you think, of these guests? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2239.02s)]
*  Maybe Ted Joya. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2243.1s)]
*  But I like Sam's quickness and emphasis on speed also as a way of thinking about other people. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2245.1s)]
*  So I felt I had more in common with him than maybe I was expecting to. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2251.02s)]
*  And a kind of do it right away obsession with speed and how he evaluates other people by their speed. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2254.46s)]
*  I very much sympathized with. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2260.7799999999997s)]
*  It was one of my favorite parts of that discussion. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2262.2999999999997s)]
*  Just how quickly do they respond to their email? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2265.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, who are the... [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2268.38s)]
*  So Altman brought up that as a founder thing. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2269.5800000000004s)]
*  Do you have any sense of a pattern among, you know, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2272.94s)]
*  you send out a lot of invites to conversation with Tyler [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2275.34s)]
*  and generally email with some of these people. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2278.7000000000003s)]
*  So who are the speed responders? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2280.54s)]
*  I don't think I remember. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2282.94s)]
*  Russ Roberts, perhaps. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2284.46s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2287.02s)]
*  But I think maybe, yeah. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2288.78s)]
*  If it's younger people and you don't know how to evaluate them, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2291.8999999999996s)]
*  it obviously takes on greater weight in your impression. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2295.1s)]
*  And it's kind of an arrogant, like, why shouldn't you respond to me right away? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2298.7799999999997s)]
*  But I think it's true. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2302.54s)]
*  And it's fine if they want to downgrade me. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2303.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't take that personally, like they're going to do something else. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2306.06s)]
*  But then I figure I should downgrade them. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2309.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's the equilibrium. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2311.2599999999998s)]
*  Very well. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2313.2599999999998s)]
*  Some more questions from Twitter. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2314.2999999999997s)]
*  And then we'll talk, we'll go back in the decade a little bit [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2315.8199999999997s)]
*  and look at marginal revolution through the years. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2318.7s)]
*  Actually, just through one year, 2009. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2321.4199999999996s)]
*  New recusant on Twitter. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2323.5s)]
*  What econ-related facts surprised Tyler the most in the last decade? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2325.66s)]
*  Bitcoin, China. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2329.18s)]
*  What surprised you? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2330.7799999999997s)]
*  Bitcoin surprised me multiple times. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2332.2999999999997s)]
*  China, I thought, would have an excess capacity debt crisis. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2335.2599999999998s)]
*  And it didn't. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2339.4199999999996s)]
*  So those would be two big picks. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2340.62s)]
*  That the rate of unemployment fell to such a low rate definitely surprised me. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2342.7799999999997s)]
*  Those would be the three big ones that come to mind right away. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2346.7s)]
*  Trump winning, not an economics thing, but it surprised me, sure. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2349.7400000000002s)]
*  Looking back over the last decade. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2353.5800000000004s)]
*  So I went back and I looked at every post from December 2009. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2355.5800000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2358.78s)]
*  Partly to look at your end of year list because I think people would, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2359.26s)]
*  I'm going to bring up some of your recommendations in December 2009. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2362.0600000000004s)]
*  We'll see how they held up. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2364.7000000000003s)]
*  What's your sense? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  Do you remember what you were writing about in December 2009? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2367.42s)]
*  Well, not month by month, but I know that time there was plenty on the financial crisis, of course. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2370.6200000000003s)]
*  And I think the blog, like 2005 to 2010 or so was very different than the blog today. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2375.82s)]
*  And I do understand, I think, those differences. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2381.9s)]
*  So 2009 for you, the book that you had published was Create Your Own Economy, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2385.02s)]
*  which was renamed in paperback to Age of the Infovar. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2390.06s)]
*  That's right. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2392.86s)]
*  Is that your only book that's been sort of rebranded like that? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2393.66s)]
*  As far as I know. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2396.86s)]
*  So it was before- [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2399.1s)]
*  The original title was bad, so I'm glad they renamed it, but it's a sign of failure in a way. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2399.58s)]
*  I bought it with the original title and I was living abroad at the time and I had it shipped to me [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2404.7s)]
*  and I emailed you. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2408.7799999999997s)]
*  Did I respond quickly? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2411.1s)]
*  You did. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2412.2999999999997s)]
*  I think within two, I checked it last night. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2413.1s)]
*  You responded within two hours. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2415.2599999999998s)]
*  I'll screenshot it for the transcript. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2416.7799999999997s)]
*  You responded within two hours because I sent you a picture because I was living [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2419.02s)]
*  in a place where it wasn't easy to get a book. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2423.34s)]
*  I couldn't go to a bookstore. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2426.06s)]
*  I'll just put it that way. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2427.1s)]
*  This was from Africa? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2427.98s)]
*  Yeah, it was from Rwanda. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2429.1s)]
*  Oh, so that was you. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2429.66s)]
*  I remember that email. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2430.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2431.34s)]
*  But I didn't know it was you. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2431.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2433.58s)]
*  That was me. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2434.3s)]
*  And I was sitting in, yeah, paying taxes in Rwanda and I read a third of the book sitting- [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2435.5800000000004s)]
*  My opinion of my own memory just went up. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2440.6200000000003s)]
*  That's good, yes. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2442.7000000000003s)]
*  My opinion of my own laterality just went down. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2444.1400000000003s)]
*  When I look over your post from 2009, what struck me is some of it feels sort of old [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2447.7400000000002s)]
*  blogosphere, old internet in the sense that some of the links are broken, some of the blogs don't [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2454.54s)]
*  exist. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2458.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2459.42s)]
*  But I was struck by how many of the themes to me felt very still topical. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2460.2200000000003s)]
*  Obviously, there was sort of credit crunch. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2466.1400000000003s)]
*  You and Alex talked about Avatar because it was the biggest movie that came out. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2467.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes, which is bizarre, completely falling down the memory hole. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2471.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2474.86s)]
*  Although they're going to do like five sequels, right? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2475.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2477.34s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2478.2200000000003s)]
*  None of the sequels. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2479.1800000000003s)]
*  But I think I see them. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2479.26s)]
*  So there is some of that, but what struck me is, yeah, the consistency and- [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2480.6200000000003s)]
*  You're referencing Scott Sumner. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2485.9s)]
*  I'm sure there's- [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2487.9s)]
*  Scott's now at Mercatus, of course. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2489.1000000000004s)]
*  And Scott's now at Mercatus. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2490.6200000000003s)]
*  There's probably a Henry Farrell thing in there somewhere, crooked timber. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2492.1400000000003s)]
*  CWT, yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2497.26s)]
*  Actually, what was interesting- [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2499.82s)]
*  The real lesson is the supply of bloggers is inelastic, right? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2500.46s)]
*  There is. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2503.82s)]
*  And what should we infer from that? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2504.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm not sure, but it's significant. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2505.5s)]
*  Well, I'll get to this now. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2507.1800000000003s)]
*  So Alex has a post discussing Paul Romer, who we've had on and won the Nobel Prize- [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2508.6200000000003s)]
*  Yes, the year before. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2514.38s)]
*  ... last year, and talking about how the average age of people who are getting grants [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2515.66s)]
*  is going up, and he wonders if that's the reason why there's a slowdown in productivity [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2520.7s)]
*  or progress, which I thought was very, very funny. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2526.38s)]
*  There was also a weird coincidence in that December 2009, Paul Samuelson had just died. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2530.7s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2534.94s)]
*  And so Paul Volcker, as we're recording this, has just passed away. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2535.58s)]
*  One thing that surprised me is that I was clicking through the posts, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2540.22s)]
*  and I was going from December 31st back, and I clicked to the second page of posts, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2543.9s)]
*  and I still wasn't even to Christmas. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2549.26s)]
*  And the output, I thought, was much higher. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2551.34s)]
*  And I looked, and you had, on MR in December 2009, you had 160 posts. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2554.06s)]
*  So you were posting five times a day between you and Alex. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2558.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2561.6600000000003s)]
*  This month, it looks like you're on pace maybe to do about 130. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2562.14s)]
*  So that's four a day, yeah. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2566.54s)]
*  So has your productivity slowed down, and what are your reasons? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2568.14s)]
*  Is it the age, or do you have other explanations? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2571.58s)]
*  No, it's on purpose. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2573.74s)]
*  I'm doing more other things, including the podcast. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2574.62s)]
*  But I think in 2009, I was still experimenting in some fresh way with blogging as a new medium [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2577.58s)]
*  and what it meant. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2584.22s)]
*  And in some ways, the blog was better than for that reason. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2585.42s)]
*  Whereas now, Marginal Revolution, it's a bit like, well, the Economist's Magazine plus a Dose of Me. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2588.54s)]
*  And that's a set formula. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2594.7s)]
*  I don't know that there's that much more experimentation I can do or should be doing. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2596.86s)]
*  Maybe that drains a little bit of energy out of it. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2601.02s)]
*  But people know what to expect more, and I think that's the biggest difference. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2603.5s)]
*  My explanation, too, would be this was really before Twitter took off. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2607.1s)]
*  And so I would think that some of those marginal posts are now just tweets. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2610.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2613.98s)]
*  So you used to have a segment called the best paragraph I read today. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2614.46s)]
*  I don't think that you would do a lot of just, you still do to some extent, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2618.22s)]
*  but I think a lot of that would actually just be a tweet today and not a post. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2622.54s)]
*  And if you think about the transcripts behind a CWT and they go on the blog, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2626.22s)]
*  they're equal to a lot of posts. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2631.4199999999996s)]
*  And so are Bloomberg columns. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2634.22s)]
*  They're 800 words, typically. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2635.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2637.02s)]
*  And that's longer than an average post. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2637.5s)]
*  So people have to click. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2639.4199999999996s)]
*  But I think if you adjust for that, the amount of material is not really down at all. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2640.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2644.7799999999997s)]
*  So the rate of progress, the rate of productivity for Marginal Revolution, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2645.18s)]
*  for Tyler Cowell and Alex Tabarrok. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2649.18s)]
*  It's presented more economically, but it has not fallen. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2651.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2653.8999999999996s)]
*  Let's get into some of the recommendations. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2654.7s)]
*  So you've now like it's become more of an institution for you. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2656.14s)]
*  Interestingly, you do have recommendations, but they're more offhand. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2660.14s)]
*  They're a little flip like you. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2663.2599999999998s)]
*  When you talk about movies, you say these are what come to mind. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2665.2599999999998s)]
*  Whereas I know now you actually kind of catalog it and you try to keep a list running through the year. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2669.18s)]
*  And that's right. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2674.7s)]
*  Do you have any sense? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2675.58s)]
*  Let I don't try to keep a list. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2676.62s)]
*  I keep a list. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2677.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big difference. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2678.7s)]
*  Yes, you keep a list. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2680.2999999999997s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2681.4199999999996s)]
*  I have privilege to have the Marginal Revolution drafts post and I see it in there. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2682.06s)]
*  And I do peak because I'm always curious. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2686.7799999999997s)]
*  Let's do movies first. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2688.94s)]
*  Do you have any sense in 2009 what your favorite movies of the year were? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2690.38s)]
*  No idea whatsoever. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2694.46s)]
*  And what movie was exactly which year other than Star Wars? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2695.66s)]
*  I'm not sure there's like a single movie I could tell you or just a small number. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2699.82s)]
*  So the list you gave was Tyson, which I don't even know what that is. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2703.66s)]
*  I didn't look it up. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2708.14s)]
*  Tyson. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2709.18s)]
*  I Love You Man comedy. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2710.22s)]
*  District 9. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2712.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2713.58s)]
*  Up the Pixar film. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2714.38s)]
*  Bruno. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2715.98s)]
*  Let the Right One In and the Hurt Locker and documentary Man on Wire. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2717.34s)]
*  District 9, Let the Right One In and Man on Wire have aged the best on that list. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2723.1s)]
*  And Bruno probably has aged the worst. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2728.06s)]
*  It's still a good list, I think. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2730.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2731.98s)]
*  Of course, it was what you could see then was a bit different than what you could see now. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2732.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2736.94s)]
*  It was pre Netflix. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2737.5s)]
*  So the list would be different now. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2739.26s)]
*  There would be more movies from the year before on Netflix disc. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2741.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2746.38s)]
*  Fiction. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2746.94s)]
*  You say my favorite works of fiction this year were the new Pamuk, Orhan Pamuk, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2747.58s)]
*  who comes up when you interviewed like Danny Roderick. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2752.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2754.86s)]
*  You put him up with Dero. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2755.1s)]
*  That was still a good pick, yes. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2756.3s)]
*  The Museum of Innocence was the book. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2757.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2759.6600000000003s)]
*  Gail Horovitz, The Confession of Noah Webber. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2760.6200000000003s)]
*  You know, I met her this year. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2763.1s)]
*  She was phenomenal. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2764.3s)]
*  I loved meeting her. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2765.1800000000003s)]
*  I was very honored. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2766.1400000000003s)]
*  Natasha and I were in Israel and we made a point of contacting her. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2768.06s)]
*  And I still love that book. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2771.02s)]
*  A great pick. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2772.2999999999997s)]
*  And A Happy Marriage by Raphael Iglesias. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2773.5s)]
*  Who is an extremely underrated writer. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2776.2999999999997s)]
*  He's the father of Matt and more people should read him. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2778.22s)]
*  Speaking of the old blogosphere who is obviously still continuing at Vox. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2781.18s)]
*  And Dr. Neruda's Cure for Evil is maybe Raphael's best book. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2786.22s)]
*  And he has a new one online, which I haven't read yet and I've been meaning to. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2790.54s)]
*  I wish he would get more attention. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2794.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2796.2999999999997s)]
*  For nonfiction, you said the new Gabriel Garcia Marquez biography, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2797.02s)]
*  which I don't know what the title of that was. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2802.14s)]
*  The link was broken and I forgot to look it up. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2804.14s)]
*  Do you remember Offhand? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2807.1s)]
*  Not the exact title, but a good book. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2808.22s)]
*  Chris Wickham's The Inheritance of Rome. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2810.46s)]
*  Yes, good pick. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2813.02s)]
*  Eric Siblin's The Cello Suites, J.S. Bach, Pablo Casal, and The Search for a Baroque Masterpiece. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2813.98s)]
*  I feel very good about my old picks, I have to say. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2819.2599999999998s)]
*  I bought The Cello Suites on that recommendation. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2821.9s)]
*  I read it with my now wife. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2824.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2825.82s)]
*  And we had a great time reading it together. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2826.22s)]
*  I've bought many books off Marginal Revolution, as I suspect listeners have. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2828.62s)]
*  So you feel good about your picks? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2833.2599999999998s)]
*  I do. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2834.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2835.3399999999997s)]
*  At least from 2009. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2835.58s)]
*  The cinema, like one or two of them are off and all the others still seem kind of perfect. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2837.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2841.8199999999997s)]
*  Do you feel- [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2843.02s)]
*  It's interesting that cinema picks are more uncertain about how they held up over time. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2844.06s)]
*  It makes intuitive sense, but I'd like to have a good theory as to why that is. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2848.62s)]
*  Yeah, well something like Avatar, which is the biggest movie of the time, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2852.14s)]
*  as I think it's been noted on Marginal Revolution, just completely disappeared from the [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2855.34s)]
*  cultural consciousness. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2860.2200000000003s)]
*  It has not made an- [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2861.34s)]
*  We know the sequels are coming. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2862.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2863.82s)]
*  But beyond that- [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2864.3s)]
*  But I feel if I saw it again, and maybe I will, I wouldn't say, gee, how could I have liked that? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2866.14s)]
*  It would feel like, gee, that was some weird but brilliant dead end. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2871.58s)]
*  And a lot of wonderful movies should be weird but brilliant dead ends. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2875.02s)]
*  What's fascinating is I think it was Alex linked to a post of a think piece on Avatar, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2877.98s)]
*  and it was about white privilege. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2884.14s)]
*  And I just thought that that was so funny because it felt like such a present day take on Avatar, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2886.14s)]
*  but it was actually happening in 2009. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2891.42s)]
*  Blue privilege, I would say. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2893.66s)]
*  All right, so looking forward, 2029, are you still blogging? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2895.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2901.2599999999998s)]
*  Are you still podcasting? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2901.9s)]
*  Ten years from now, probably not, but it's possible. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2903.9s)]
*  I'm not quitting anytime soon. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2907.42s)]
*  If you said five years, I'd say, oh, definitely. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2909.58s)]
*  Ten years, hard to say. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2912.06s)]
*  My voice might give out. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2914.46s)]
*  We know that the, we've often talked about this, you and I, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2917.42s)]
*  that the power CWT listener is actually a reader, that they read the transcript. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2920.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2926.22s)]
*  You yourself don't listen to podcasts, actually. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2926.62s)]
*  Do you have any that you ever, you may, maybe you have to for some reason, but- [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2929.18s)]
*  Sometimes I have to, and I don't mind, but I never want to listen to any podcast, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2933.5s)]
*  including my own. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2937.98s)]
*  It's just too slow, and I'll listen to podcasts when I'm prepping for a guest, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2938.7799999999997s)]
*  and then I quote unquote have to, but that's it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2942.94s)]
*  So I have no idea like who really is a good podcast. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2945.5s)]
*  So given that you don't listen to them, a lot of our sort of most successful listeners [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2948.54s)]
*  don't listen to it. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2954.86s)]
*  They read the transcript. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2955.82s)]
*  Most don't offer a transcript. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2957.02s)]
*  So what they do with other podcasts, I don't know. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2958.54s)]
*  Some people have their own transcripts made. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2961.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2963.58s)]
*  But does that mean that podcasts themselves are overrated in a sense, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2964.14s)]
*  and that writing and the written word is still underrated? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2967.82s)]
*  Yeah, the whole genre mystifies me. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2971.02s)]
*  I don't see why anyone does it or listens or cares. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2972.7s)]
*  It's bizarre given that I produce the output, but I never would have predicted it, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2976.62s)]
*  and it always feels to me like a bubble. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2981.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't think it is at this point. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2983.4199999999996s)]
*  It's less of a bubble than blogs were. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2985.18s)]
*  I think the big insight was that people were wasting their time a lot more than we thought, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2987.66s)]
*  and mobile and social media and podcasting all filled that space. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2992.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2996.9399999999996s)]
*  I think it is a way to fill up some of that idle time with content that actually is better [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=2997.58s)]
*  than what you're typically going to consume, to the extent that we're competing with mobile games, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3003.74s)]
*  which I think is one of the things you're going to do with your idle time for an average person. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3009.18s)]
*  I feel our audience listens and reads, but podcasts as a whole, I wonder, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3013.02s)]
*  is it just like some kind of drone in the background, like Musac, Musac with a human voice? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3018.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3023.98s)]
*  I'm sure some people listen to it that way. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3024.7799999999997s)]
*  For me, it's actually replaced music, which may not be a good thing, but I stopped. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3026.94s)]
*  This is back in iPod days. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3032.06s)]
*  I've been listening to podcasts for a long time, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3033.34s)]
*  and it just replaced a lot of the music that I might have been listening to. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3035.1s)]
*  I feel music is a dynamic influence on ourselves, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3039.02s)]
*  and when music gets replaced, we should worry. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3042.2200000000003s)]
*  Music can change, and you listen to different kinds of music, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3045.26s)]
*  and there's a propulsiveness to it that the spoken voice doesn't have. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3048.62s)]
*  So you've made me more worried. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3052.94s)]
*  But at least for the next year, we'll keep it going. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3056.06s)]
*  Maybe five years, we'll see. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3059.18s)]
*  No, I don't mind inflicting the human voice on people. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3060.7s)]
*  I'm happy to corrupt them and tear them away from beloved music. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3063.2599999999998s)]
*  But just viewed aesthetically, if you think of, say, the 1960s and 70s, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3067.5s)]
*  music was primary in that era, and there was something very creative about that, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3071.74s)]
*  and that was a time when we made a lot of big, bold decisions, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3076.06s)]
*  not all of them good ones, but nonetheless. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3078.94s)]
*  Maybe the drone of the voice in the background [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3081.66s)]
*  reflects the complacency of our time, and podcasting is a form of complacency, maybe. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3084.38s)]
*  And on that happy note, let's wrap up. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3089.66s)]
*  And look forward to another year and more of working together. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3093.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3096.38s)]
*  I have enjoyed this, and for those of you listening, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3096.94s)]
*  please do let us know if you did too. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3099.74s)]
*  We'll do it more. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3101.5s)]
*  Before we close, I'd like to shout out the other people at Mercatus [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3102.78s)]

*  How do they get back to the studio, right? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3130.38s)]
*  Someone does it. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3132.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not always us. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3133.02s)]
*  It's part of the production function. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3133.98s)]
*  Unheralded. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TR14MGmr78&t=3136.06s)]
