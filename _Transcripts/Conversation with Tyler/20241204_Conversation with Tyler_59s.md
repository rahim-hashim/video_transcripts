# Stephen Kotkin on archival research and its dark reality | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc)
*  I've learned a lot and I've certainly stretched my mind and come to understand the world in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=0.0s)]
*  power much better than I did before, even though there's a ways to go. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=6.36s)]
*  But it's enough already. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=10.26s)]
*  Seeing the evil, you probably don't have the experience, your world is mostly digital, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=11.76s)]
*  you don't have the experience of going through documentations with his signature on it, and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=16.76s)]
*  there's dried blood on the page. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=22.6s)]
*  So that's the kind of work I've been immersed, the world I've been immersed in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I understand how his mind works, it's not his blood that's on that page. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=28.0s)]
*  It's somebody else's blood from their interrogation that he's reading and signing off on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=33.6s)]
*  And so from the point of view of power, it's endlessly fascinating, it's a lifelong learning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  It's a gift as I say, but from the point of view of morality, freedom, the stuff that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=45.0s)]
*  I cherish and believe in and I'm privileged to be able to experience, it is just devastating. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcESqxmCVtc&t=51.76s)]
