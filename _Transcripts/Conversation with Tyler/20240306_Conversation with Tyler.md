# Marc Rowan on Financial Market Evolution and University Governance  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cD8_nbuyiU)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm talking with Mark Rowan, who is co-founder and now CEO of Apollo Global Management.
*  Mark also has been leading a campaign to reform and improve American higher education.
*  Mark, welcome.
*  Thank you so much.
*  And while I do lots of interviews, this is actually my first podcast.
*  You said recently on Bloomberg that higher interest rates don't hurt the profitability
*  of Apollo.
*  How do you think about that in terms of your portfolio, what you do?
*  How do you manage to be in that position?
*  So I just think globally about the shape of our business.
*  So we are today a $650 billion asset manager.
*  Roughly $500 billion of that is credit, and $150 billion of that are various forms of
*  equity.
*  Quite frankly, it's just math.
*  We do better on the $500 billion when rates are higher, up to the point that you have
*  economic distress.
*  And most of our equity, they are pretty savvy about how they borrow and how they lock in
*  interest rates and using fixed rate and other hedging instruments.
*  So generally we have upside to the level of interest rates.
*  But how is it you manage to do maturity matching so much better than, say, alternative institutions?
*  I'm not sure it's better.
*  I think you have to look at the structure of our business.
*  So I assume by other institutions you're really talking about the banking sector.
*  Sure.
*  Which was bigger before the rise of private asset management.
*  Well yes and no.
*  Private asset management has not caused the decline of the banking system.
*  The banking system has been shrinking in the US as a percentage of the total while it's
*  been growing for a very long time.
*  So just to set levels, the banking system today is roughly 20% of corporate and consumer
*  credit in the US.
*  The rest of it is not, quote, private credit.
*  It's investors.
*  You know, if you think about it at a very macro level, regulators, governments, they're
*  really only two choices for credit.
*  You can have credit come from the banking system or you can have credit come from the
*  investment marketplace.
*  But now to your question, if you think about the banking system, the banking system borrows
*  short and lends long.
*  They are always mismatched.
*  If you think about what we do, and different than many, half of our money comes from individuals
*  and institutions who are seeking a rate of return.
*  They have no maturity.
*  They have no defined outcome that they want.
*  Therefore, they are willing to commit their money for lengthy periods of time, so long
*  as they are obtaining the right risk and reward and they are not focused on day-to-day liquidity.
*  They're focused on the ultimate return for this piece of their portfolio.
*  The other half of our money comes from the insurance industry, including our own affiliated
*  insurer Athene and money we manage for Athora, our European affiliate, as well as a number
*  of third-party insurers.
*  And insurers, unlike the banking system, they borrow long and lend long and everything, therefore,
*  is asset-matched.
*  If you look at Apollo today, there is nothing that is daily redeemable.
*  But there's a traditional history of insurance companies suffering from some kind of duration
*  risk, right?
*  In the 1990s, how is it that Athene Apollo avoids that?
*  What is it you do that's different?
*  So jumping around, insurance, you have to really look at it over a long period of time.
*  Almost all of the problems that have come in the insurance industry of any scale for
*  100 years have come from traditional companies who have made poor choices as to their liabilities.
*  We spent a lot of time today talking about assets, but most poor decisions have come
*  from liabilities.
*  Think about people who reinsured asbestos risk.
*  Think about people who provided DNO insurance to the Enron's and others of the world.
*  Think about people who insured Japanese earthquake and meltdown risk.
*  Think about all of the mispricing in financial markets, whether it's what GE did on long-term
*  healthcare or it's what many companies did on variable annuity.
*  These are liability problems.
*  The asset problems in the insurance industry have actually been quite modest over a really
*  long period of time.
*  You have executive life, you have mutual benefit, and then you have a large number of small
*  companies that add up to essentially nothing.
*  Assets have not traditionally been a weak spot for the insurance industry.
*  It's been liabilities.
*  But what's the source of your comparative advantage in making better liability choices
*  than say older school insurance companies?
*  Where does that come from?
*  Well, it comes from a very simple business model.
*  We are at Athene in one business.
*  We're in the business of retirement services.
*  And therefore, we don't guarantee or don't insure your life.
*  We don't insure your health.
*  We don't insure your home.
*  We don't insure your automobile or any other form of catastrophe.
*  We simply insure your retirement.
*  And we do that through annuities and we do that through pension.
*  Those simple liabilities are locked in and they are essentially a means for individuals
*  to save.
*  We have a retirement crisis in this country.
*  People have not saved enough.
*  Social Security is unlikely to provide a good standard of living for the vast majority of
*  people.
*  And so we also have a system that encourages retirement savings.
*  Retirement savings in insurance products are tax free.
*  They build up tax free.
*  And someone commits to these policies for 5, 10, 15, 20 years.
*  And at the end of that, they have tax free compounding at nice rates of return.
*  So given that so few other institutions seem interested in addressing this problem of retirement
*  risk, what's the source of the comparative advantage that allows Apollo to do it?
*  Make money doing so.
*  Apparently be stable.
*  How do the pieces fit together?
*  Where's the so-called free lunch coming from?
*  Is it your talent?
*  The building you bought or what is it?
*  I assure you it's not my talent.
*  I'm fortunate that nearly 10,000 people make me look good most days.
*  Not every day, but most days.
*  So if you think about our industry, in our industry you need four things to be successful.
*  The easiest of those things is capital.
*  If you are a responsible investor and you sell investors on a long-term business plan,
*  you should be able to raise capital.
*  But if you look at our industry, the public companies in the retirement services business
*  over the last decade have raised virtually no capital.
*  Fundamentally, investors have decided they do not trust the public companies as good
*  stewards of capital.
*  And in fact, the vast majority of these companies have paid out their current book value as
*  dividends over the last decade.
*  So I start with, well, capital should be easy.
*  Capital for this industry is actually quite hard.
*  And so we showed up in 2008 with capital.
*  That doesn't guarantee you'll be successful.
*  The next piece is you need long-term low-cost liabilities.
*  Initially, as a startup company in 2008, we had no right to participate in this market.
*  But 2008 was a very tumultuous period of time.
*  Lots of companies were looking to get back to their quote home market.
*  And people were selling off old blocks of business.
*  We bought old blocks of business and we did it successfully and got to scale.
*  And we acquired a large amount of low-cost business.
*  Today, that same opportunity, by the way, is no longer available because there are not
*  big blocks for sale.
*  The interest rate environment is different.
*  There's not the same tumultuous need to sell.
*  And so we are now the largest originator, organic originator, the sale of new products
*  through traditional channels in the retirement business.
*  Last year we did some 60-plus billion.
*  This year we're projected to do 70-plus billion just in the US.
*  This is a big market if you get it right.
*  So long-term low-cost liabilities that are predictable that you can invest against.
*  Third, you need a scaled low-cost operating infrastructure.
*  Even though we are not the largest insurer, we are the largest retirement services company,
*  we focus on one product segment.
*  You look at other big insurers, they have diverse operations.
*  In some cases, they don't have scale in any of their businesses even though they are quite
*  large.
*  We are, as one product based in Iowa, really efficient, very low cost, and that allows
*  us to make money.
*  But the other thing that you need to be successful, an insurance company, a retirement services
*  company needs to both be and appear to be and project solvency.
*  Regulatorily you need solvency, rating agencies you need solvency, and if you're backing
*  20-year promises, you need solvency.
*  So you need lots of low cost, lower risk, higher yielding assets.
*  And we have become, at Apollo, experts in originating these higher quality, higher yielding
*  assets, so-called private credit, and have been successful in originating them to the
*  benefit of Athene and others in the insurance industry.
*  So how do the macroeconomics of this new world work?
*  If you don't have much maturity matching risk, you're relatively insensitive to where
*  interest rates are moving.
*  So if the Fed is controlling interest rates, say to disinflate or for any other reason,
*  it seems that matters much less than it used to.
*  Do you agree?
*  To us, yes, it matters much less than it used to.
*  We run in our retirement services business a spread business, and in that spread business,
*  the absolute level of rates is not all that important.
*  We are able to earn a spread on our assets versus our liabilities versus our cost of
*  operations such that we are profitable and therefore can both attract new capital, retain
*  the capital we have, and provide investors with a reason to invest with us for the long
*  term.
*  But say more and more of the economy goes into relatively successful private credit.
*  Doesn't the Fed have to raise interest rates all the more because there's no impact or
*  no major impact on your lending and the lending of your peers, but there's still some banks
*  out there, 20%.
*  So to get those banks to respond, does monetary policy become tougher and tougher to pull
*  off?
*  How do you think about this?
*  I think it has become tougher and tougher to pull off.
*  I think that to the extent we lived in a world where banks were 100% of the credit market,
*  there was a very direct relationship between Fed action and now and what happened in the
*  economy.
*  To the extent 80% of credit is now provided by investors.
*  Forget about private credit for the moment, but by investors, there is a less direct,
*  but still incredibly important because the alternatives, you know, as rates go up, credit
*  becomes more attractive to investors versus equities.
*  As rates go down, the reverse happens.
*  So there are a lot of ability still of the Fed to influence outcomes, but it is not the
*  direct correlation that you once had.
*  But I also don't think of it in just a monolithic way about, well, the Fed has less control.
*  I think about resilient and necessary.
*  Those are the words that always come back to me.
*  I look at the US and relative to almost every other big capital market, the US is in an
*  extraordinary position.
*  And that is, in my opinion, reflective of the diversity of capital sources that we have.
*  No other place in the world really has what we have.
*  If you look at almost every Asian economy, two products, equity and bank debt.
*  Look at Europe, equity and bank debt.
*  Yeah, there's the beginnings of a fixed income market.
*  There's a high grade, but there is not the diversity of capital sources that you have
*  here.
*  And so I come back to resilient and necessary.
*  If the banking system, while really important and not going away and still vital for the
*  country, is borrowed short and lent long, every dollar that moves out of the banking
*  system and into the investment marketplace actually deleverages the entire system.
*  Think about that.
*  A bank is leveraged 10 to 12 times.
*  When you move credit out of the banking system into mutual fund, it's zero leveraged.
*  But there's less liquidity in that world, right?
*  Well, let's talk about liquidity anyway.
*  So this is one of those things.
*  Yes, it is less liquid, but we're going through a whole rethink of what liquidity means.
*  So 2008, we had just an unbelievable series of changes that took place in our economy
*  in response to the financial crisis.
*  We essentially redid all of our financial markets, financial regulation.
*  The problem is none of us have experienced that yet for any length of time, because right
*  after we changed all the rules, we printed $8 trillion and everything went up and to
*  the right.
*  Beginning in 22, we started to experience the new world and in 23, we experienced it
*  more.
*  But we all, myself included, we have a lot to learn about what this new world is.
*  But if you just look at the numbers, trading capital, the capital used for market making
*  is one tenth of what it today, of what it was in 2008.
*  And why has that gone down so much?
*  Is that Dodd-Frank partly or what else?
*  Dodd-Frank more than partly.
*  A 10x effect from Dodd-Frank.
*  Trading capital is 10% of what it once was.
*  We had an incredibly liquid market and now we have a less liquid public market.
*  By the way, we now have public markets that are three times their size.
*  It doesn't take a genius to say that's one thirtieth of the liquidity, but we haven't
*  experienced it because everything is liquid on the way up.
*  When we're printing $8 trillion, it all is good.
*  But now when things go the other way, we're finding out that what we thought was liquid
*  is not as liquid as it once was.
*  And I'm not talking about the top 500 stocks.
*  I'm talking specifically about the credit market.
*  I saw an article the other day was saying that the average length of time to sell an
*  investment grade public corporate bond is now five days.
*  We have had the first wholesale failure in a market of liquidity.
*  Think about what happened in the UK in their pension meltdown.
*  Institutions in the UK thought they had market liquidity at or near the market price.
*  They tried to sell triple A and double A obligations.
*  The market gap down.
*  They tried to sell more.
*  The market gap down again.
*  Bank of England had to step in and stabilize the market before major damage happened.
*  But why is there so much adjustment in the quantity of liquidity and not more in the
*  price?
*  Why don't you just pay people to get more liquidity?
*  That might be inefficient to higher price.
*  But isn't that what's happening?
*  Isn't that what LDI in the UK showed us?
*  Is that there is liquidity.
*  It's just not at or near the market price.
*  And I do expect that in risk off environments, we will actually see much greater price adjustment.
*  And so this comes back.
*  I don't want to go down the rabbit hole of liquidity.
*  But I want to contrast this to what I see taking place in the world.
*  We have this impression.
*  This is my 40th year doing this.
*  And we have an impression in the investment marketplace that private is risky and public
*  is safe.
*  Well, was that the case?
*  That probably was when I started in business.
*  That probably was true.
*  Most things that were private were private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds.
*  And things that were public were generally public for the right reasons.
*  Well, is it true today?
*  Right now, I look at the S&P 500.
*  I look at 10 stocks that are nearly 35% of the S&P.
*  I look at those 10 stocks that trade north of a 50 PE.
*  And I said to myself, is that actually safe?
*  Or is that just a reflection of a liquidity bubble and everyone piling into passive management
*  and everything else?
*  I don't have to conclude that.
*  But my belief of where the world is today is public is safe and risky.
*  And we've seen that.
*  Look at all the tech correction that took place in 2020.
*  It's re-correlated, right?
*  Everything is correlated.
*  But I'll make the point on safe and risky in public and safe on risky in private.
*  Because something is private no longer means it's risky.
*  Private goes from AA to levered equity.
*  Public AA to levered equity.
*  We're just talking about degrees of liquidity and whether liquidity or illiquidity is a
*  risk or not.
*  So to a wealthy individual, how many wealthy individuals, high net worth investors, need
*  100% of their money on Tuesday?
*  Probably none.
*  Therefore, they should be looking at using liquidity as a choice.
*  Are they getting paid for giving up that option to be more liquid?
*  Same for institutions.
*  If you're a pension fund, if you're an endowment, if you're a sovereign wealth fund, sure, you
*  want a portion of your portfolio that's liquid.
*  But how much of it actually needs to be liquid?
*  And so I find myself asking and talking to CIOs today and CEOs today, not so much about
*  public or private or liquid or illiquid, but are you being adequately compensated for having
*  less liquidity?
*  And are you structurally able to be less liquid prudently?
*  So if we're thinking about pre-Apollo, pre-Athene, traditional insurance companies, you're saying
*  they were investing too much in too many liquid assets.
*  And what's the reason for that market failure?
*  Why did they make that mistake?
*  It's not a question of market failure.
*  This is when you grow up in a world and private is perceived as risky.
*  Insurance companies have always been investors in private placements.
*  It's just the size of the traditional private market has been very, very small.
*  And so a small portion of their asset, so they found themselves invested primarily in
*  public assets because 20 years ago, public was safe and private was risky.
*  Well, the world we're in today does not look like that.
*  Even the term private credit, they're just two English language words that sound like
*  they mean something, but for the most part, they mean nothing.
*  In the popular press, people use private credit to refer to a very small sliver of a market.
*  They refer to private credit as direct lending or so-called lending to buyouts.
*  This is a below investment grade activity.
*  Sometimes it's really attractive, sometimes it's not so attractive, but it is a $1.5 trillion
*  market, a large market.
*  But the market that I'm talking about for private credit is $40 trillion.
*  Everything that's on a bank balance sheet is actually private credit.
*  Think about that.
*  Loans to companies, private credit, loans to consumers, private credit.
*  We haven't yet gotten to a more sophisticated view of the market where private can be AA,
*  just less liquid.
*  Public can be CCC, just more liquid.
*  There is nothing inherently credit sensitive about being public or private.
*  It's just different degrees of liquidity.
*  So in the old banking model, say I get a checking account, my local Chinese restaurant gets
*  a small sized loan.
*  In relative terms, is there now less of that?
*  What's the opportunity cost of moving to more maturity matched, higher yielding assets?
*  What is the economy giving up, even if it's a good trade off?
*  I think it's clear that the largest companies in the world have access to both the banking
*  system and to the investment grade bond market every day.
*  Medium sized and smaller companies, no matter how credit worthy, have less access to the
*  banking system and have virtually no access directly to the bond market.
*  And so they increasingly will come through intermediaries.
*  Some of that activity is below investment grade and speculative.
*  That's a perfectly fine business.
*  It's not primarily the business we're in.
*  Some of that business is investment grade and secured.
*  And that is primarily the business that we are in.
*  And so I don't think it's better or worse.
*  I think that we're just looking at evolution.
*  And I'm constantly reminded that financial services is not a status quo business.
*  I go back to when I started, beginning of high yield bond market, not a lot of high
*  yield bonds, no levered loans, no ETFs, not a lot of securitized product.
*  Those four products today we take as mainstream products.
*  Why do we expect that 15 years from now or 20 years from now, the same four products
*  will be as dominant?
*  We will end up with a new set of products and a new set of markets that reflect differing
*  market conditions and different regulatory conditions and different conditions of financial
*  institutions.
*  It's just change.
*  How stable is all this as a political equilibrium?
*  If you think about the four major banks, as you well know, they're very serious stress
*  tests applied to them, capital requirements.
*  The Fed is a major regulator, at least for insurance.
*  It tends to be at the state level.
*  One can reinsure through Bermuda.
*  Capital requirements are very different.
*  Competence of the state regulators arguably is lower than that of the Fed.
*  Whether or not one wants more regulation, and generally I don't, but is this a stable
*  situation?
*  How's it going to evolve?
*  Well, first I would have to correct almost everything you've said along the way to set
*  the table for what I'm going to talk about.
*  So first, the difference between not so much the banking system and insurance, but the
*  banking system and the investment marketplace.
*  There are plenty of ways, let's start with this, there are plenty of ways for investors
*  to lose money.
*  Investors can buy speculative stocks.
*  They could buy the S&P.
*  They can speculate in almost anything.
*  So the making or losing of money is not in and of itself a systemically risky activity
*  because we allow, and for good reason we allow, speculative investing every single day.
*  Things go up, things go down.
*  You can lose money in credit as well as in equity.
*  Okay, now we come to mutual funds.
*  If a mutual fund, which is daily liquid, owns credit and investors want to get their money
*  back, you're right.
*  Price just adjusts.
*  Mutual funds are not price guarantors.
*  Are they regulated?
*  Mutual funds are regulated.
*  Are they disclosed and transparent?
*  Yes, they're disclosed and transparent.
*  The holdings of a mutual fund are completely visible and they're delevered.
*  Is that a risky activity because it moved out of the banking system and into a mutual
*  fund?
*  I don't think so.
*  I actually think it has de-risked.
*  It's made our economy and our financial system more resilient.
*  So now I'll come to your question on political equilibrium.
*  Insurance, if you just focus on insurance, has no federal guarantee, does not borrow
*  long, has no access to the Fed and does not do liquidity transformation or maturity mismatch.
*  And they are forced to hold amounts of capital.
*  So if you look, and I'll give you a comparison just for us, not for the whole industry, who
*  holds more capital?
*  Athene, our insurer, adds a percentage of assets or the typical bank?
*  You would think the typical bank, but you would be wrong.
*  We hold more capital per dollar of assets than anyone else.
*  Who holds more investment grade assets?
*  90% of our book is investment grade.
*  The typical bank is two-thirds investment grade.
*  Sure, but that's all time slice.
*  Let's keep going.
*  Money market funds have been a source of systemic risk.
*  I can't tell you there's not risks in the economy.
*  We have a choice.
*  We can have risk dispersed among lots of institutions or we can have it concentrated in the government-backed,
*  borrow short, lend long, government-guaranteed banking system.
*  Every time we disperse that risk, we make the system more resilient.
*  If you want to focus on insurance, which is your question on political equilibrium, there's
*  more capital, there's no ALM mismatch, there's more investment grade, and there is appropriate
*  state-based regulation for institutions that do not have government guarantees or borrow
*  from the Fed or do anything else.
*  Insurance is very slow moving.
*  We're talking about, on average, 10-year assets.
*  This is a very slow moving process.
*  And again, most of the issues that have happened in the insurance industry have not been asset
*  issues.
*  They've been liability issues, exactly the kind of thing that insurance specialist regulation
*  is designed to detect.
*  But say you're a risk-averse regulator, maybe too risk-averse.
*  You're worried about off-balance sheet risk.
*  You're not very good as a regulator at monitoring off-balance sheet risk.
*  So you overreact by extending your own reach, wanting to impose capital requirements on
*  everyone, then you want to monitor them more.
*  And eventually these private institutions, which are basically healthy, they become more
*  and more like banks.
*  No?
*  So we have this example.
*  We have Solvency II in Europe.
*  Solvency II in Europe has been terrible for the retirement services industry.
*  Capacity, just the mere availability of product is down almost 40%.
*  That's an outcome.
*  That's not the outcome we've chosen.
*  And the question in credit at the end of the day, which is really what we're talking about,
*  credit is a function of GDP.
*  If you want GDP, credit can only come from two sources, the government-backed, government-guaranteed
*  borrow short-land long banking system or the investment marketplace.
*  There's no third choice.
*  Make your choice.
*  If we want less GDP, that's a choice.
*  It doesn't seem like a good choice, given the other options that are available.
*  Will crypto play a role in the future of the US financial sector?
*  Out of my depth.
*  Just don't, absolutely no idea.
*  But you interact with plenty of financial institutions that have opinions on crypto,
*  right?
*  You face the possibility of investing in crypto yourselves.
*  You might not do it, but that itself is a stand.
*  I'll give you my uneducated spectator from the sideline view.
*  Things like stable coins, things like on-ramp, things that are convertible back into fiat
*  currency are absolutely going to play a view.
*  I see every opportunity for them to reduce the cost, to reduce the friction of dealing
*  with the financial system to be an amazing on-ramp.
*  For the US, I don't really see in a KYC AML world a value of an alternative currency.
*  If you're in other parts of the world, maybe an alternative currency has more appeal.
*  In any case, Apollo is not doing it.
*  Apollo is not engaged in crypto.
*  Why would you spend a given free day in Japan?
*  And where in Japan?
*  And what would you do?
*  Well, first, Japan is an amazing place, as you know.
*  It's just so different.
*  I'm surprised by something every time I'm there.
*  But as a financial matter, you look at a society that is older, that has needs for retirement,
*  that has lived through repressed yields for more than 20 years.
*  And so you have a yield-starve society in an older population nearing retirement.
*  They need yield.
*  They are very comfortable in dollars.
*  And to the extent we are providing safe yield, total return, investment-grade private credit,
*  whatever buckets you want to talk, Japan is absolutely the perfect market for what
*  we do.
*  And I think it's a matter of education.
*  And that education is taking place.
*  Japan also has an insurance industry that is in the middle of a capital transition,
*  has had a very, very difficult time raising capital.
*  And so that's also a fabulous reinsurance market.
*  So between my love of culture, my love of the food, the need for safe yield, and the
*  need for reinsurance capital, it feels like a highly productive place to be.
*  As you know, Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.3.
*  South Korea now is at 0.7 and falling.
*  That's astonishing.
*  Do any financial models work when your total fertility rate is 0.7?
*  You know, again, I want to stick to that, which I think I'm good at.
*  So over the horizon, as a country, as a matter, probably not.
*  The population projections I have seen for lots of places in the world are just shocking.
*  But in the little corner of the universe that Apollo participates in, a 10-year period,
*  a 20-year period is not really all that different than it is today.
*  Your grandfather, Emmanuel Stein, he was an economist.
*  What did he taught at NYU?
*  Labor economics, labor relations, what did you learn from him?
*  He was my first job.
*  I was living in South Florida.
*  I would come to New York for the summer.
*  And he was a labor arbitrator.
*  And so I would come work for him the summer.
*  He would dump a bunch of briefs on me and I would summarize the arguments.
*  And then I would debate the cases with him and then he would go off and write the opinions.
*  So it was a pretty good way to get a good view of the world as between labor and management.
*  What made him a good labor arbitrator?
*  Patience.
*  He was just a remarkable individual, multilingual, a Torah scholar.
*  Just had incredible amounts of patience and humility.
*  Your free day in Japan when the work is done, where do you eat?
*  What's the best food in Tokyo?
*  You know, I kind of take it from the concierge at wherever I'm staying.
*  I look for one traditional Japanese experience and one, give me the latest, newest, greatest,
*  because Japan does create new and great in addition to traditional.
*  The best French food I've ever had was in Tokyo, in fact.
*  It's amazing, isn't it?
*  You never know what you're going to find.
*  That's right.
*  Your interest in architecture.
*  Is brutalist architecture overrated or underrated?
*  Is it actually good?
*  So I don't know that I would say I'm interested in brutalist architecture,
*  but I am interested in building things.
*  So for whatever reason, I am not a collector of anything.
*  I don't collect wine.
*  I don't collect art.
*  I don't collect cars.
*  But I do like building things and have always liked building things.
*  Starting from my late 20s when I built my first house, I built lots of houses,
*  lots of restaurants, lots of stores, small office buildings.
*  And I just keep going.
*  Whatever itch it scratches, I find it to be just an incredibly creative outlet,
*  really enjoyable.
*  And everyone always says, don't you get aggravated building these things?
*  And I said, well, only if you have to move in on a certain date.
*  But if you're flexible, as it relates to brutalist architecture,
*  you're referring to the apartment in New York City.
*  On Fifth Avenue, yes.
*  The answer is, I don't know that I would have chosen it,
*  but there's something about it that I just found incredibly appealing.
*  This was a full apartment built with no right angles,
*  everything curved in very simple materials, but very beautiful materials.
*  And you feel it's held up visually?
*  It's had to be redone.
*  Visually, it's held up beautifully.
*  But maintenance?
*  Every surface that was used to build in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s is now gone.
*  It's been rebuilt in the same style, but with new materials and new techniques.
*  How do you think about whether or not there should be a Red Hawk
*  nest at that building?
*  I don't think about it at all.
*  I rarely see the hawk or hawks, and it does not interfere with my life.
*  And you just never worried about the Red Hawk nest?
*  There's so much else to worry about, but I never worry about the Red Hawk nest at 9275.
*  Here's a question I've asked a number of guests.
*  Both Patrick Collison and I both have made the observation,
*  it seems there are really very, very few attractive residential neighborhoods
*  built after World War II in this country, or if you look at Europe,
*  places rebuilt after wartime damage.
*  They're mostly ugly or mediocre or maybe at best OK.
*  You might challenge the premise, but why do you think we've lost the ability
*  to build beautiful neighborhoods?
*  Plenty of lovely homes, lovely individual corporate buildings,
*  but neighborhoods?
*  All the good ones are old.
*  Why?
*  Well, you got here first.
*  Whoever got here first took the good physical location.
*  I think we're in a rebuilding mode, certainly in most of this country
*  and certainly in Western Europe.
*  There are beautiful things and beautiful neighborhoods being created.
*  I'm back from 12 days in the Middle East.
*  We like or not like the style of what's being built,
*  but the scale, the ambition, the new neighborhoods, the ability to create new
*  is extraordinary.
*  And where impressed you there?
*  So to see what's happening in Riyadh in Darya,
*  which is their traditional neighborhood,
*  there's 9 million people on the way to 13 million people,
*  to see what's going on in Abu Dhabi, on Museum Island, and Sadiat,
*  and other places.
*  The scale of ambition there is actually quite impressive.
*  I don't love everything, but I am impressed of their ability
*  to get things done and to actually re-envision on a grand scale
*  something we really haven't done in this country in a very long time.
*  In the United States, do you think we're on the verge of building
*  a new Shaker Heights, which is not on a spectacular plot of land, right?
*  It's outside of Cleveland, gorgeous homes, wonderful neighborhoods,
*  trees, perfectly integrated.
*  And they were quite poor compared to us.
*  Why no Shaker Heights today?
*  Or do you think we're doing one?
*  I'm not sure.
*  Don't know.
*  I mean, certainly, I look at the places where
*  you have population increases.
*  Most of what I've seen that I really like, Austin, Texas.
*  We're going to have whole new neighborhoods in Austin, Texas,
*  places that are physically beautiful, that were just outside the core
*  and now are being built.
*  Again, we can say that's progress or not progress.
*  If you're commuting into the downtown Austin,
*  you're not so excited about that.
*  But I think in places that are still growing,
*  it is pretty dynamic.
*  And will we or should we repurpose these big box, big glass,
*  modernist office buildings?
*  Are they permanent or they've passed their due date?
*  Or how should we think about those?
*  I worry less about the look and feel of the office.
*  I think an office is an internal thing.
*  Does it encourage the kind of collaboration,
*  the kind of working environment that you ultimately want for a company?
*  I look at you.
*  You've just come from our cafeteria.
*  And the productivity increase that we've experienced
*  from the casual collisions of people seeing each other every day
*  needs to happen inside a physical space in this office.
*  Does the exterior of the building really matter to me?
*  No, not really.
*  So what else have you done here at Apollo,
*  where we're sitting at the moment, to make it a better internal office?
*  How do you think about that design?
*  Well, first, you're going from a very low bar to a much better situation.
*  We were spread throughout this office building
*  on non-contiguous floors with separate cafeterias
*  in what I would call traditional executive offices
*  for the more senior people and bullpens for the more junior people.
*  Nothing that I've just said is now true.
*  We are now in a contiguous low rise of this building
*  on nine contiguous floors, all connected by staircase.
*  We have lots of places where casual collisions take place.
*  We have our coffee bar.
*  We have our cafeteria.
*  And for the most part, we've become much more
*  egalitarian with respect to offices.
*  One of the things that I've done when I took over as CEO,
*  I have a windowless office off the trading floor.
*  And next to me is Jay Clayton, former head of the SEC.
*  He has the same size windowless office.
*  It's given me tremendous moral authority
*  when it comes to the arrangement of people's offices
*  to say, you're welcome to take mine.
*  And I think that culturally, leadership here has embraced it.
*  We now sit not with each other.
*  We sit with our teams.
*  We are spread throughout this building in a good way.
*  If you need to hire a new person to make major decisions,
*  significant commitments of funds, what non-obvious quality
*  do you look for in that hire?
*  So I wish it were that straightforward.
*  We could test for this and do it.
*  But you must use your intuition at some level, right?
*  We all do.
*  What does your intuition tell us that I wouldn't learn
*  from someone else?
*  No one gets hired to make major decisions right away.
*  So let's start with that.
*  I will say jokingly, your first year at Apollo
*  is mostly useless.
*  Your second year, you're at 30% capacity.
*  By the third year, you feel like you've been here 10 years.
*  We have lots of smart people.
*  And there are lots of smart people in financial services.
*  This is about cultural fit.
*  And it's understanding where we're going
*  and whether the organization can absorb the specific decision,
*  the amount of change, or whether it has
*  to be prepped in a certain way.
*  We are not chess pieces that can be moved around.
*  And I just got back from an offsite with all 201 Apollo
*  partners in Abu Dhabi.
*  Really interesting way to get together,
*  three most valuable days of the year for me.
*  First thing I said, a small group of us
*  cannot run this business.
*  There are too many important decisions, to your point,
*  that are taking place at levels that I will never see
*  and that could never absorb.
*  I have to get the buy-in of 200 people
*  to successfully run this organization.
*  And so when I present, or the leadership here
*  presents a strategic plan, we're in debate mode.
*  There's very little that gets done in the way of Dicta here.
*  You're hiring a 22-year-old for an entry-level position,
*  but a potentially significant one.
*  What non-obvious qualities do you look for?
*  Yes, they're smart.
*  They work hard, maybe went to a good school.
*  What else?
*  So they have to love their job.
*  You can't fake this job for very long.
*  People say, isn't it really hard?
*  Isn't it take over your life and everything else?
*  Absolutely.
*  And so if you don't like it, this is probably not
*  a good place for you.
*  At the end of the day, though, being
*  able to take a blank piece of paper
*  and think about what's not there is the skill that gets them
*  from mastery of numbers of analytics
*  to actually decision-making.
*  And I think back, and I'll relate it personally for me,
*  I started at Drexel-Burton.
*  And at Drexel, we financed companies
*  where there was a non-zero chance
*  their business would not exist.
*  You spent an awful lot of time thinking about the future,
*  the business plan, the specifics.
*  We were not banking Exxon.
*  Exxon was there then, it's there now.
*  That's a process of maximizing the efficiency
*  of Exxon's particular corporate action that's needed.
*  Something that forces you to think about where something
*  is going, whether the business will exist,
*  how things will change, how you make capital commitments
*  in the context of uncertainty is really what you want to see.
*  You don't see that in a 22-year-old
*  because you see them as masters of their craft.
*  You don't actually know till a number of years
*  after someone's here whether they possess that ability,
*  which is to bring all their outside influences,
*  their knowledge of what's going on in the world
*  to bear in the business along with relationship.
*  At the end of the day, this is a complex business,
*  but it's also a really easy business.
*  People do business with people they like.
*  Are you likable?
*  Are you relatable?
*  Are you good at building relationships?
*  Having the right answer is helpful.
*  Being able to convey that answer in a way
*  that someone else will absorb and to engage in a dialogue
*  with them, much more important.
*  Here's a quotation from you, I think,
*  if you could explain it to us.
*  Our business, like the real estate business
*  and some other business, is hours of boredom
*  followed by moments of terror.
*  We really only make 20 decisions a year.
*  What are you getting on about there?
*  Well, I was really talking about,
*  it's taken out of context, but it is what I said.
*  Give us the context.
*  The context is I was talking about the difference
*  between being an equity investor and a debt investor.
*  So in the private equity business,
*  you work incredibly hard,
*  but if you look at what we do as a firm,
*  and we're one of the largest in the private equity area,
*  we make 10 or 20 decisions a year.
*  Everything else is ceremony.
*  And so hours of boredom followed by moments of terror
*  when you actually have to decide.
*  But if you think about that business,
*  if I come in on Monday and I don't like what I see,
*  I go home.
*  Tuesday, same thing.
*  And I keep doing that until I like what I see,
*  and then I make an investment,
*  because I'm only making 10 or 15 investments a year.
*  And now I'll contrast that with the credit business.
*  In the credit business, I come in on Monday,
*  and I take the least bad alternative on Monday,
*  and the same on Tuesday and the same on Wednesday.
*  So my job in the credit business
*  is to create more least bad alternatives,
*  to create more origination,
*  to create more diversification, to create more options,
*  because I know if I'm serving insurance companies,
*  our own insurance company or someone else,
*  a thing needs six or $7 billion a month.
*  That's what I need to create.
*  And so it's two different speeds.
*  It's two different ways of looking at the business.
*  It's two different ways of thinking.
*  But I also want people to know that
*  in the equity business,
*  hours of boredom followed by moments of terror.
*  Given recent developments,
*  and you've been involved in some of these,
*  do you ever feel that Apollo and other top firms
*  in the New York financial sector,
*  that they're just hiring too many people
*  from so-called top schools?
*  Are you rethinking that?
*  I really don't think that,
*  because we as a firm, we've branched out so much,
*  and I'm sure the other firms have branched out as well,
*  which is yes, when we started,
*  it was easy to hire from a core number of schools
*  into the private equity business,
*  and it was very self-selecting.
*  So I came from the University of Pennsylvania,
*  and it would not surprise you
*  when I ran recruiting,
*  50% of the firm came from the University of Pennsylvania.
*  Then we democratized, we had a few people from Duke,
*  and a few people from Virginia,
*  and now it is a complete democratization
*  from all over the country, all over the world.
*  The fastest growth in our business right now
*  is taking place in India.
*  And people say, well, that's back office?
*  No, it's just an office.
*  We're 500 people in Mumbai.
*  We'll be 1,000 people in Mumbai in three years.
*  And those people are coming from all over the world.
*  What makes you bullish on the India office?
*  It's just an incredible labor pool.
*  We have a place that grew up as a back office for everyone,
*  where it's now just become another office.
*  The English speaking, the time zone,
*  the work ethic, quality of people.
*  And we're scaling almost every business in India,
*  professional businesses, risk businesses,
*  technology businesses,
*  and what you would consider traditional back office.
*  It's all happening.
*  What's the biggest obstacle to doing business in India?
*  The biggest obstacle is just capital markets.
*  I'm not sure we're gonna deploy all that much in India.
*  So if I think again about the Indian economy,
*  like many other Asian economies,
*  you have equity and you have bank debt.
*  So now I'll talk about our strategy, particularly in India.
*  It used to be that we were there supplying equity,
*  but guess what?
*  Local Indian entrepreneurs, the wealthy families,
*  they have amassed significant amounts of capital.
*  There is no shortage of equity in India.
*  And my guess is if there's an interesting opportunity
*  in India, we would not be the first ones to see it.
*  Therefore it tells me we're not a great equity investor
*  in India, other than around the margins.
*  On the other hand, in the banking system,
*  banking system is very low cost.
*  And if the bank is willing to supply something,
*  we should let the bank do it and not compete with them.
*  So our business plan in India is to be between equity
*  and between bank, because there's virtually nothing
*  that exists of size and scale.
*  So when Adani buys the Mumbai airport,
*  we lend him 750 million US.
*  When families in Mumbai wanna consolidate
*  their real estate holdings, we lend them 400 million US.
*  These are, there's a lot of business to do,
*  but it is not, we can go there and say,
*  we're in the equity business
*  or we're in the bank debt business,
*  but that's not the opportunity.
*  It's also not the opportunity in most of Asia.
*  Now, is this your correct title,
*  your chairman of the board of overseers
*  at the Wharton School at UPenn, is that correct?
*  We no longer use the word overseer.
*  Okay, what is it?
*  I'm chairman of the board of advisors
*  at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
*  Why you have so many university boards?
*  They seem to have fallen asleep on the job
*  or they're even part of the problem
*  or it's hard to reform them.
*  Structurally, what's gone wrong?
*  Guilty as charged.
*  So I was, you know, I've been very public in this.
*  I was a member, not just of the chair of the Wharton Board,
*  but also a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania.
*  There were approximately 50 trustees.
*  And the way you get to be a trustee for the most part
*  is you put in service at one of the other boards
*  and then you are graduated over time to the trustee board.
*  Every other board at a university
*  is a non-fiduciary board.
*  It's an advisory board, including the board that I chair
*  at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
*  It's an advisory board.
*  When you move to the trustees,
*  you actually become a fiduciary.
*  No one tells you that.
*  The boards don't behave any differently.
*  With 50 members, it's very difficult to engage
*  in substantive debates.
*  And for the most part, and I put myself
*  in the negatives here as well,
*  trustees have actually not fulfilled their duties.
*  So if you take UPenn as an example,
*  UPenn's charter is actually quite interesting.
*  If you look at the questions that I've written
*  to the trustees about and questions
*  that I think they should answer in thinking
*  about where the university goes
*  and how they choose the next president,
*  those are for the most part not questions
*  that Mark Rowan dreamed up.
*  These are questions posed directly from Penn's charter.
*  Trustees are supposed to set standards for admission.
*  They're supposed to set standards for faculty promotion.
*  They're supposed to set a strategy for the school.
*  They're supposed to evaluate the efficacy
*  of various academic departments.
*  Can they actually do that?
*  The answer is, sure they can.
*  Can 50 people do that?
*  No, 50 people cannot do that.
*  So the boards are too big.
*  You think they should be smaller.
*  On average.
*  I think boards have to be of a level
*  where people can actually have a debate
*  and set a series of guidelines.
*  And like every board of directors,
*  they're not going to be able to do that.
*  They're going to be able to set a strategy
*  for the board of trustees.
*  They're going to be able to set a strategy
*  for the board of trustees.
*  They're going to be able to set a strategy
*  for the board of trustees.
*  So imagine if you were the past president
*  of the University of Pennsylvania.
*  You arrive after two very long serving presidents.
*  You are hired by this board of trustees
*  and you go to work.
*  What's your goal?
*  What's your plan?
*  How is success judged?
*  What's the university's policy on viewpoint diversity?
*  What's the university's policy on free speech?
*  The board of trustees, myself included,
*  we never actually provided a roadmap
*  for the president to be judged against.
*  So it does not surprise me
*  when confronted with difficult situations
*  that there was no guide.
*  I can't imagine that's a recipe for success.
*  And so my own view,
*  and this is what I've written at UPenn,
*  is trustees should first answer fundamental questions
*  about policy and where they want the university to go
*  in partnership with their academic peers,
*  because the academy also has a series of rights
*  and responsibilities.
*  And once the university knows where it wants to go,
*  hire the next president against a business plan,
*  a strategic plan, as to what they should do
*  and what they should accomplish.
*  It's unfair to leave them directionless.
*  Now, fortunately, UPenn is in a very good place right now,
*  has a very stable pair of hands,
*  and Larry Jamison, who's the interim president,
*  so they'll have time to do this.
*  Why are academics as a whole so cowardly and conformist?
*  You said that, not me.
*  That's fine, I'll say it.
*  But it's true, in my opinion.
*  The answer is, I think it's career risk.
*  I do think that they've bet their careers
*  on achieving tenure and achieving the notoriety
*  or reputation amongst their colleagues,
*  and they're loathe to lose that.
*  So what's been interesting about this entire process,
*  the number of professors, department heads,
*  department chairs, who have reached out
*  and just said thank you.
*  Thank you for saying what needed to be said.
*  And I'll say thank you while we're on the record,
*  but please continue.
*  I say to them, I say, well,
*  you don't know how many of you there are.
*  If you're a Wharton faculty member,
*  what are you interested in?
*  You're interested in academic excellence in research.
*  If you're an engineering faculty member, same thing.
*  If you're a doctor in the med school, you're a professor.
*  Same thing.
*  There's such a large group that is actually interested
*  in getting to the core mission of a university,
*  academic excellence in research.
*  And without a guiding set of principles,
*  every day the university is facing some sort of crisis.
*  Where do they stand on free speech?
*  Are there any limits to academic freedom?
*  What is the goal of the university?
*  Is the university viewpoint neutral?
*  There is no policy, and in the absence of policy,
*  many things seem arbitrary.
*  And say you're talking to your grandkids or your kids
*  or someday your great grandkids, and they ask you,
*  where should I think about going to school?
*  And I put aside U-Penn, which obviously you might recommend
*  for a bunch of reasons, but what insight do you have
*  into this?
*  Where should they go?
*  What do you need to learn?
*  I mean, think about how much the world has changed.
*  The world has changed massively in almost every sector.
*  Not so much in academia.
*  We still have professors standing in front of classrooms,
*  and while the tools are better.
*  It's not like high yield bonds, right?
*  It stayed the same.
*  It's not like technology.
*  So I'll give you an analogy to what's happening.
*  I am involved in academia in Israel.
*  For the past 38 years, I have either chaired or co-chaired
*  what has become Israel's best private school network.
*  Public charter is probably a better way to describe it.
*  We're 50 schools.
*  We're roughly 30,000 kids in school.
*  We're 3000 teachers.
*  We only work in the periphery of Israel.
*  Ethiopians, Yemenis, Druze, Bedouins, Eastern Europeans.
*  And we teach, we use union teachers.
*  We teach the state curriculum.
*  And our kids from these poor neighborhoods
*  who have a historical track record of not performing
*  are now performing at among the best levels in Israel.
*  Overall, the network is roughly 90% matriculation rate
*  for their bug route, their university test.
*  And we've wholesale changed communities.
*  And we've now seen this over 38 years.
*  So this is not-
*  And how did you do that?
*  That's the punchline.
*  So how?
*  We have to teach the state curriculum with state teachers.
*  The only way we can do this is we can teach it
*  any way we wanna teach it.
*  If you go into a darker school,
*  you are unlikely to find a teacher standing
*  in front of a classroom in any class.
*  Technology has been brought into the classroom.
*  New ways of teaching has been brought.
*  Experimentation has been brought into the classroom.
*  Games have been brought into the classroom.
*  We trial lots of things,
*  and we double down on those things that work.
*  We are essentially a laboratory for changes in academia.
*  So I can't imagine the status quo is going to hold
*  that 20 years from now,
*  we're going to have professors standing
*  in front of classrooms doing what they do.
*  The tools are just so different.
*  The amount of intelligence that people can gather
*  from outside the class and research is so different.
*  What do they need to know?
*  How to figure out what's true, critical reasoning,
*  how to use the resources and apply critical criteria
*  to those resources.
*  Is the memorization of dates and times and places
*  and orders fall that important?
*  Probably not.
*  Critical reasoning context.
*  If someone's doing a trip to Israel,
*  they might typically go to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv.
*  Where should they go that you know about
*  and maybe they don't?
*  They need to go to the desert by a lot.
*  I am, of the things that I do,
*  and I don't do all that many things well,
*  but other things I do well, age adjusted,
*  I mountain bike pretty well.
*  In Timna Park near a lot is a landscape
*  that is otherworldly.
*  Desert, rock, sand formations, unbelievable
*  and beautiful new hotel there also.
*  How many restaurants do you own in Long Island?
*  Three.
*  Another, as I joke, I'm the accidental restaurateur.
*  Two under the name Duriers, one in Montauk,
*  one in Orient Point and then Lulu
*  on the main street in Sag Harbor.
*  What if you learned about the economics
*  of restaurants from those?
*  I actually learned that the restaurant business
*  is a better business than most people give it credit for.
*  And I make the following observation.
*  It is the restaurant business.
*  Most people who go into the restaurant business
*  don't know anything about the business side of restaurants.
*  Most people who go into the business are undercapitalized
*  and therefore the first time that they experience
*  some sort of difficulty, they go under.
*  And also a lot of it is very parochial.
*  People haven't traveled the world to see what's out there.
*  And the best thing I've learned is find the right partner
*  who knows something about running a restaurant
*  because I know nothing about running a restaurant,
*  but I know a lot about business.
*  How much of your profit do you make on wine and drinks
*  compared to food?
*  That's the old cliche, right?
*  If the food is break even, is it true or not?
*  No, it's not true.
*  I mean, I think about the decisions we've made out in Montauk
*  where reputationally we've decided only to serve wine and beer,
*  no hard liquor.
*  Could we make more money serving liquor?
*  Absolutely.
*  But it's not how we run.
*  People want to come there for the experience
*  and we do just fine on the food as well.
*  And what kind of food is it?
*  Think of Saint-Tropez meets Cape Cod.
*  70% of it is some form of lobster, which of course I
*  don't eat, but that's a whole other story.
*  And the chef is French?
*  My partner is French and my partner
*  and the key chef who's overseeing all the culinary
*  experience is French as well.
*  And what if you learned about design
*  by having three restaurants in Long Island?
*  Each one is different.
*  So Montauk, as I've suggested, is a very traditional Cape Cod
*  style.
*  Orient Point mixes a North Fork style
*  with tidbits of Mykonos and what's been done there.
*  And Lulu could be on the main drag in Tel Aviv.
*  And last question, what is the next thing you want to learn?
*  Well, language wise, I'm 1,200 days into Spanish.
*  And so I now need to go spend 30 days someplace
*  where people just talk to me in Spanish
*  and I think I have a chance.
*  Where will you go?
*  There's many candidate places, right?
*  Latin America, the English proficiency is not that high.
*  I think sunny Spain.
*  Sunny Spain.
*  I can bring my mountain bike as well.
*  So Spanish is the next thing you want to learn.
*  So Spanish is the next thing you want to learn.
*  Spanish is the next thing I want to learn.
*  Mark Rowan, thank you very much.
*  Absolute pleasure.
*  Thank you.
