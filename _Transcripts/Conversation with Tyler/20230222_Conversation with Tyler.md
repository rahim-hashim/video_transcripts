# Brad DeLong on Intellectual and Technical Progress  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IvChrUmsuc)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I am speaking with Brad DeLong on his book known as J Bradford DeLong, on Scholar.Google
*  known as J Bradford DeLong, but to most of us known as Brad DeLong.
*  He is professor of economics at UC Berkeley.
*  He and I went to grad school together at Harvard.
*  He was one of the very first, if not the first economics blogger and he this year
*  has out a long awaited New York Times bestselling book, Slouching Towards Utopia, an economic
*  history of the 20th century.
*  Brad welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you very much for having me and giving me an opportunity to sell books, as well as
*  to talk to one of the most smart people and wide ranging people I know about the economy,
*  political economy and similar things.
*  Thank you for that.
*  If I look at the productivity and growth statistics for the late 19th century, they're highly
*  fragmentary, they're imperfect.
*  What do you think the numbers are showing us?
*  Because they don't look that good.
*  Is it that we don't trust the numbers or is it the numbers like that are what big progress
*  meant back then?
*  I think the numbers then are what big progress meant back then.
*  And that, you know, I mean, John Stuart Mill in the 1870s could think and had some reason
*  on his side that there actually had not been an increase in working class real wages across
*  the years from 1800 to his day.
*  And a bunch of that is distribution, but a bunch of that is simply slow growth.
*  You know, that things like the 2% per year income and productivity growth that we have
*  grown used to, you know, since the coming of the second Industrial Revolution, since
*  the start of Bob Gordon's one big wave, that really is completely unprecedented.
*  You know, there was nothing like that before, you know, not in the biggest efflorescences,
*  not in the classic British Industrial Revolution.
*  If we're trying to think about the period, say 1870 through to the 1920s, when you have
*  some kind of modern consumer society, what's the best number for reflecting how big that
*  change was?
*  I would say that you got to look worldwide and that if you look worldwide and if you
*  take account of the fact that world population has now hit growth has now hit kind of more
*  than 1% per year after 1870, that you had something like 1.3% per year for average world
*  income growth from 1870 on up to the eve of World War I worldwide.
*  And you do what I do, which is say, let's take real income growth and add half of population
*  growth and call that technology growth.
*  Do that and you get something like 1.7% per year for the global rate of increase of quote
*  technology unquote from 1870 to 1913, you know, which is four times what the worldwide
*  average was back in the Hansempuri before 1870.
*  It's a huge shift and it's one of the things that makes the modern world as we know even
*  vaguely possible to imagine.
*  If I'm trying to understand economic statistics and if I believe the 50 years starting in
*  1870 have changed everything.
*  But if I also believe the last 50 years in the West did not change everything, gave us
*  computers and Internet, but it's had growth rates that are not probably too far from the
*  earlier rates, like what accounts for that difference?
*  Should we then say it change everything or change if didn't change everything, but it
*  changed a lot of things.
*  There is there is a difference between the growth rate of wealth and what that growth
*  rate of wealth means.
*  You only go from having no indoor plumbing and no public health and so having half your
*  babies died before the age of five to one in which infant mortality is extremely low
*  and a genuine astonishing tragedy once.
*  You only go from spending two hours a day at least thinking about how hungry you are
*  and how it really would be nice to have more calories right now to not having to think
*  about that, you know, kind of once.
*  You know, you only go from having your children so malnourished that the adult heights of
*  the boys are five foot three to the adult heights five foot nine or so on average.
*  You only do that once.
*  And we did that and we did that mostly in the 50 years after 1870, at least for the
*  global north.
*  We're doing equal things in terms of how much we're making since, but with possible
*  exceptions after 2006 slowdown.
*  But in some sense, it means a great deal less because it doesn't impact our thinking and
*  our family tragedies and our children so malnourished that they're badly stunted in
*  such an obvious and visceral way.
*  But there have been big changes, right?
*  You want to talk about modes of production.
*  You want to be an orthodox Marxist and following not so much Marx, but Friedrich Engels.
*  And you say there's a huge jump between feudal society and the commercial societies of the
*  gunpowder empires between 1000 and 1650 or so.
*  But then there's another equal jump between the gunpowder empire commercial societies
*  and the steam power societies of 1870.
*  But the second industrial revolution beasts of 1910 or so are a different animal, too,
*  as are the mass production societies of 1960, as was the global value chain society of 2000.
*  And right now, we're well into an info biotech economic revolution.
*  The underlying technology driven forces of production are continuing to change and are
*  continuing to change a lot.
*  But in some sense, we think it means less simply because our needs are much less are
*  biologically much less urgent.
*  Why did German universities so blossom in the 19th century?
*  It seems like quite astonishing record, even just Gerttingen for mathematics taken alone.
*  It's hard to believe, right?
*  It is an absolutely astonishing thing.
*  Not something that I would have expected back, you know, before 1800, not something I really
*  have a great deal of understanding now.
*  You know, it certainly is a wonderful and marvelous thing from the perspective of what
*  society just beginning to kind of crawl out of the Malthusian agrarian age, you know,
*  decides to do with its wealth, with its time, with its focus.
*  And not parallel, not equal to anywhere else.
*  You know, not even the land grant colleges and the private universities of the US could
*  do it.
*  Nor France, right?
*  There are reasons that my great, great grandfathers and great, great, great uncles went to Germany
*  for graduate school.
*  What do you think of the common view that England in some way fell behind Germany in
*  the late 19th century?
*  Well, you know, the fact that in 1913, the largest British electrical manufacturing firm
*  is the English subsidiary of the German Zeenans.
*  You know, that speaks a lot.
*  The fact that Britain is still richer in any, at least in any comprehensive GDP kind of
*  accounting is, I think, in large part because Germany is dragged down because when we speak
*  of Germany in this sense, we're meeting the Ruhr and the Rhineland largely.
*  And some of Silesia and some of Saxony as well.
*  I mean, it is absolutely marvelous that you would expect the country that is the most
*  industrialized and that has, you know, at least the most advanced universities in 1800
*  to have an enormous comparative advantage in driving forward technology and in maintaining
*  its place as the kind of industrial technological leader.
*  And yet not.
*  So what was Britain doing wrong those years then?
*  There are arguments that you know too much.
*  Well, they're the standard arguments that were applied to Holland before and that are
*  applied to the US today.
*  You know, financialization, rent seeking, an over mighty state taxing the economy in
*  order to accomplish geopolitical goals.
*  You know, that for Britain, it does seem to have been a
*  a unwillingness to focus the attention of society on pushing engineering forward.
*  And, you know, once you start to lose the concentrations of the, you know,
*  of the communities of engineering practice, you know, it's quite easy to lose more.
*  And it's quite easy to get yourself back into a vicious spiral.
*  I would always talk about how Americans and Germans would be much more willing to invest
*  in enterprise and that in Britain, you really did not have the growth of the large
*  intermediaries, you know, like the Deutsche Bank on the one hand and the JP Morgan
*  partnership on the other, you know, that saw themselves as being in the business of
*  intermediating information, intermediating information between people who had money
*  that they needed, whether they wanted to save and invest and people had ideas that they
*  needed to deploy.
*  And that the rationalization and routinization of that through investment banking,
*  universal banking in the years after 1870 played a substantial role.
*  I was never really able to nail that down to my full satisfaction.
*  But that was always my guess.
*  I would have to say we really do not know, but that it does tell you how quickly within
*  one or two generations what we think of as technological leadership and technological
*  supremacy can ebb away.
*  As a matter of position in leading sectors of the sheer mass of engineers engaged in
*  communities of engineering practice and also the educational system certainly played a
*  big role that Germans were being trained to manipulate molecules and organic chemistry
*  while Britons were being trained to write verses in the style of Macaulay, which would
*  be the poems that the Romans would have written if they had been Scots as a focus of their
*  educational system.
*  What do you take to be the best understanding of the 17th century scientific revolution?
*  Oh, if indeed you view it as a 17th century revolution.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, I mean, I always think Joel Moqueer is absolutely magnificent
*  on this.
*  I think he understates the role that having printing by movable type played in kind of
*  creating a, you know, the community of scientific practice and knowledge seeking.
*  There's one thing, there's one thing that happens that is extremely unusual, right?
*  That I'm.
*  Okay, back before 1870.
*  Back before 1870, there's no possibility at all that humanity is going to be able to bake
*  an economic pie sufficiently large that everyone can have enough, which means that principally
*  politics and governance are going to be some elite constituting itself and elbowing other
*  elites out of the way and then finding a way to run a force and fraud domination and exploitation
*  scheme on society, you know, so that they at least can have enough that when Proudhon
*  wrote in 1840s that property is theft, it was not metaphor.
*  It was really fact.
*  And what does this elite consist of?
*  Well, you know, it's a bunch of thugs with spears, the people who have convinced the
*  thugs with spears that they're their bosses and their tame accountants, bureaucrats and
*  propagandists, you know, which means most of the time.
*  If you have when you have a kind of powerfully moving forward set of people thinking about
*  ideas, whether the idea is true is likely to be secondary to whether the idea is useful
*  to helping me keep my place is a tame propagandist in the force and fraud domination and exploitation
*  elite.
*  This is a point I've stolen from Ernst Gellner, and I think it is very true.
*  And yet somehow the Royal Society decides no, the Royal Society decides nothing except
*  through experiment, you know, that we are going to demand that nature tell us or tell
*  one of us or at least someone writes us a letter saying they've done the experiment
*  about what is true.
*  And that is a miraculous and completely unexpected transformation.
*  And one to which I think we owe a huge amount.
*  And where does that impulse come from?
*  Of the Royal Society?
*  It seems not an accident that it's in England, the same era when you're developing rule
*  of law, constitutional thought, some theory of the rights of man, other stranger movements.
*  Right, right, right.
*  You know, I mean.
*  Kind of.
*  Oh, when I go looking back, I said starting around sixteen hundred, the intellectual
*  air starts to smell different.
*  You know, you have a Maso de Campasola writing in the City of the Sun about how there has
*  been more technological progress in the past century than in millennia before.
*  He then ruins the effect by saying, and this is a result of the astrological influence
*  of the moon and Scorpio.
*  Which as a period of technological progress, we would find rather lacking in many ways.
*  And you have Francis Bacon saying that the world has been utterly transformed by, you
*  know, the compass by movable type printing and, you know, gunpowder.
*  And the utopia he goes on to paint is one in which there is indeed Yo Solomon's house,
*  a bunch of scientists devoted to uncovering the secrets of nature, to the enlargement
*  of the human empire and to the effecting of all things possible.
*  You know, and this, that utopia or cornucopia, at least is on our future and is going to
*  be because we figured out how to use our minds to understand things.
*  Rather than because we've managed to recover a golden age or because some theological being
*  has come to our rescue or because we finally figured out the right static social order.
*  That's kind of unusual.
*  And I got to trace it to what happened between 1500 and 1600, which was the discovery of
*  the New World, the subsequent Colombian exchange, the great reduction of the prices of carrying
*  goods across the world as a result of the first globalization.
*  You know, that and the tinkering culture of Western Europe meant that in 1600 you could
*  the first time in history really say, wow, things are a lot different than they were
*  even 100 years ago.
*  In fact, we know more than anyone in the past ever did.
*  That in earlier ages, you look back and you see monuments of at least some ancient civilization
*  that looked pretty impressive to you.
*  By 1600, no.
*  And so by 1600, the idea that knowledge was a possible thing that humanity could grab
*  for, you know, was in the air.
*  And as you say, it all concentrates in England.
*  It all concentrates in England.
*  Or maybe better to say it all concentrates in a circle.
*  Yeah, a circle 300 miles around the port of Dover because Hume and Smith and the other
*  Scottish Enlightenment people kind of head for London fairly quickly in order to get
*  inside the circle and get inside the discourse.
*  That is a wonderful and marvelous thing to have happen.
*  And I think it is a systematic change from the House of Wisdom in Baghdad in 900 or from
*  the empirical and, you know, metaphysical and, you know, alchemical researchers of the
*  researchers of the Song Dynasty.
*  And as I say, we're very lucky it happened.
*  What do you think of the original Paul Romer view that across the very long run, growth
*  rates simply rise?
*  Well, you know, depending on, you know, something bad seems to happen after the year 150.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  That up until the year 150, I think you can say yes.
*  Although whether you can actually back that up with numbers you can semi believe in really
*  depends on what you see of the population evolution of humanity toward the end of the
*  Bronze Age.
*  You know, that there's a fight between the Hyde people who think that Bronze Age empires
*  were much more populous than others did, who think that the big increase in human settlement
*  population and technology before the year zero came in the late Bronze Age with the
*  Hittite and the Babylonian and the Egyptian empires of the time.
*  And the rest of us who tend to think that we see an acceleration with the coming of
*  classical civilization as a whole, you know, in the Axial Age.
*  And I'm on the Axial Age side, but it's disputed.
*  After 150, though, after 150, things really do fall off a cliff, both in terms of the
*  sophistication of high society and also in terms of the rate of increase of human population,
*  at least Eurasia wide.
*  You know, and it's not just that the Romans vanish from Britain.
*  And it's not just that the Latin language frontier gets pushed back so that it's out
*  of Britain completely and has moved 200 miles into France as one elite succeeds another.
*  You know, it's that there's an enormous destruction of the mechanisms that we're pushing ideas
*  forward, you know, in the Western but also in the Eastern Roman Empire, in Persia and in India,
*  which are subject to repeated fairly disastrous barbarian invasions and the successor states
*  never kind of get back to the level of social of investment infrastructure and other investment
*  ideas, putting forward ideas about manipulating nature.
*  And in the fall of the Han dynasty in China and the Warring States period and in the subsequent
*  Tang dynasty that you look at it until the sun arrive and people start once again
*  doing serious selective breeding with rice, that it looks like the
*  rate of technology advance gets back in gear.
*  You know, I can't convince myself that between 800 and 1500, the rate of growth of world technology
*  was any greater than in the age of classical Persia and Greece and the coming of Han China,
*  even though the population in 800, you know, it was kind of three times what it had been
*  when classical Greece started.
*  There's a big interruption of the Roman story from 150 to 1500.
*  And afterwards, it seems to me it's not so much two heads are better than one,
*  but rather we find and make much better institutions, you know, in fairly discrete steps.
*  If we take your answer, which I largely agree with, it seems to me strikingly non-Malthusian.
*  In the book, you see much more a Malthusian,
*  that the problem over the very long run is simply the ebbs and flows of population.
*  Well, you know, say, you know, say you have technological progress of 5% per century worldwide
*  before 1500, which supports maybe an average century in which human population grows at 10%.
*  You know, and, but then, you know, then after 1500, you can say that that triples,
*  you know, and say,
*  one third from the fact that you actually now get globalization,
*  because you now have ships that can actually sail rather than having to kind of
*  break bulk at eight different spots along the way.
*  And one third from the Colombian exchange itself, and one third from, you know,
*  the tinkering and innovative and royal society culture in Western Europe.
*  So that after 1500 worldwide, it's not 5% per century for technology, it's more like 15%.
*  And so you see population growth rates of maybe 30% per century worldwide.
*  But, you know, 30% per century is still a Malthusian economy.
*  It's got to be a somewhat richer one.
*  You have to be somewhat richer so that your population can grow at 30% rather than 10%
*  per century.
*  But still, half your babies die, still life expectancy is 30.
*  Still, you wouldn't expect, you'd expect living standards to increase on average by just enough
*  to support the 30% per century population growth rate rather than the 10%,
*  but still a Malthusian economy.
*  The interesting question is what happens between 1770 and 1870?
*  When, you know, we looks like we get our global rate of technological progress up to almost half
*  a percent per year, which means that, you know, a 1% per year population growth rate, you know,
*  could kind of eat all that up in terms of smaller farm sizes offsetting better technology.
*  But you do have an upper class whose living standards are being transformed by new inventions,
*  and you do have a doubling of humanity's technological capacity every 70 years.
*  Is that thing, even though it is still the Charles Dickens, John Stuart Mill,
*  we're not going to get anywhere unless we get a handle on our population growth problem.
*  Is that 1770 to 1870 global economy still a Malthusian?
*  Moving ahead to the 20th century, as you well know, Keynes predicted a kind of leisure society
*  would come to the West reasonably soon, and people still work quite a bit.
*  Yes, now, earlier than now.
*  What exactly did Keynes get wrong, in your opinion?
*  Obviously a very smart man.
*  Yes, I really do not know, right, that I'm tempted to follow
*  Richard Easterlin and say that modern economic growth is not a triumph of, you know,
*  humanity over material, humanity and technology over material want,
*  but of material want over humanity and technology.
*  You know, that I now have an 18-year-old laptop or an 18-month-old laptop
*  and I find myself annoyed that it's not as fast as another laptop I could get
*  using a slightly, not a slightly improved, using a much, a significantly improved process of,
*  you know, turning sand into something that can damned close to think
*  with parts four nanometers on a side in the most complicated human manufacturing
*  and division of labor process ever accomplished.
*  So complicated that in fact there are only two productive organizations that
*  each of which is absolutely essential for it, one of which is the one in the Netherlands
*  that makes the extreme ultraviolet machines, and the other one is the one in Taiwan that knows
*  how to actually use the extreme ultraviolet machines to carve paths for electrons to flow
*  in stone, in stone made of sand. You know, I should be, and most of the time I should be aware that
*  materially I'm very quite sated that when I do spend a lot of money on a dinner out and on a
*  bottle of wine I have a nagging worry that, you know, suppose I were to take this money and buy,
*  you know, 20 McDonald's gift certificates and go down to a local child care center and hand them
*  out to harassed single mothers who are having difficulty making ends meet, you know, wouldn't
*  the smiles on their faces be better, be, make me happier than actually drinking this stuff?
*  And, you know, it's a question. And yet as you say I work pretty damned hard,
*  and I work pretty damned hard in large part because I like my work, but also because I am
*  somewhat of a status-seeking individual, and it's something like, you know, Leah Quad-Ahamid's review
*  of Snouching Towards Utopia in Foreign Affairs this morning, the idea that someone as smart and
*  accomplished and as knowledgeable as him thinks I actually belong in his company, that really does
*  send me over the moon. Is that a bad thing? Is that me living my best life? Would Kane say that I am
*  no longer in the kingdom of necessity, that in fact I have outgrown the kind of community of those
*  hag-written by the vices of avarice usury and precaution, which we pretend are virtues because
*  they're socially useful and I'm now living my best life wisely and well? Or would I be better off
*  simply taking things off and going down and hanging out at my cousin's place in Malibu?
*  Was Schumpeter correct about the bureaucratization of the large business firm?
*  I would say in the very long run, no. In the medium run, you're definitely yes.
*  That there's
*  an organization, you look at the
*  Apple TSMC, it's not yet a duo monopoly, it's not yet the combination of Wintel, but it's kind of
*  getting there in its sphere. And it's an extremely taut and low bureaucracy organization when you
*  look at the entire value chain. You take a look at Google, and it also looks to be an extremely
*  taut unbureaucratic value chain. You look at the old Twitter, and yes, the old Twitter apparently
*  was highly bureaucratized because nobody could get approval to ship anything. And whatever you
*  think of Elon Musk will do of Twitter, which my view is he's most likely to simply light it on fire
*  and burn it down, it is going to be an experiment in which he takes the organization that had become
*  extraordinarily bureaucratic and seriously shakes it up, possibly to the long run,
*  possibly to the long run public good. About a decade ago, you and I did a symposium
*  with Greg Clark, I think it was at UC Davis, and we talked about his book Farewell to Alms. Since then
*  he's had other books, The Sun Also Rises, For Whom the Belcher Rolls. What do you think of his approach
*  to economic growth after all these years, now that you've thought about it, written your own book?
*  Well, his approach is the huge kind of approach, there's the hard largest scale.
*  I'm looking at the 20th century, which is a considerably smaller scale thing.
*  And so what I'm most interested in is that all the things that Joel Moak here talks about,
*  all the things that Greg talks about, all the other stuff that gets you up to 1870.
*  And then you wave your hands and say the story continues.
*  In this book I've taken the position, and I'm about 70% sure I'm right, that really no,
*  the story doesn't continue. That say from 1770 to 1870 you have the half a percent per year on
*  average of steady technological progress. But one third of that comes because the last set of
*  glaciers served as bulldozers and scraped all the post-Permian rock off of a good chunk of
*  Northwest Europe, leaving all the stored sunlight in the form of coal right there on the surface
*  for you to pick up and then use to power steam engines. And about one third of that comes from
*  the second globalization, allowing you to pull all the manufacturing of the world into the districts
*  in which manufacturing was most productive and efficient. And by 1870 the really cheap coal was
*  pretty much gone and you'd already pulled in all the manufacturing. And that leaves you with the
*  underlying rate of invention and innovation, which is about one sixth of a percent per year,
*  the things discovered, developed, deployed, and diffused in the world economy. And that one sixth,
*  that only supports population growth, that the rate of one third percent per year as farm sizes
*  grow smaller with higher population, one third of a percent per year, that's just 10 percent a
*  generation. That's still an economy that the steampunk economy in which you ran out of the
*  coal and you'd already globalized the manufacturing and you just had invention at kind of the 19th
*  century steam engine pace, the early 19th century steam engine pace, that produces a
*  steampunk economy that looks pretty damn Malthusian to me. But instead we had the one big wave,
*  as Gordon calls it, we had the sudden jump up so that we get our two percent per year productivity
*  and real income growth after 1870. And it's that two percent together with shampaterian creative
*  destruction revolutionizing the economy to double human technological competence every generation.
*  You know, that wild ride from 1870 to today, that's the story I want to tell. And you know,
*  that's a story that Greg misses because Greg is simply viewing it from too high, from too high an
*  altitude. Now when I read Hayek's Constitution of Liberty, I see a thinker who favored a social
*  welfare state, single payer health insurance, and vigorous application of antitrust law.
*  And you paint Hayek is for a laissez faire. So what gives?
*  Well, there's a Hayek and there's Hayek and there's Hayek, right? And there's a difference
*  between things that Von Hayek wrote and things that Jo Von Hayek is supposed to have written
*  and in some sense that people wished that he had written. I'm really using Hayek in my book as
*  a hook on which I can hang a set of ideas and your Palani as a hook on which I'm hanging another
*  set of ideas. And yes, you know, Hayek had moods in which he said, of course, we're not barbarians.
*  Of course, we have single payer universal health care. He also had moods in which he said that,
*  you know, fishermen who only have jobs because they can sell their fish into the world market
*  who want to complain about how the market is not rewarding them justly should simply shut up and
*  soldier. You know, there's the Hayek who very much values the Western traditions of liberty.
*  And there's the Hayek who rails against your permissiveness as the chief enemy
*  of human civilization. No, there's the Hayek. Isn't it the collectivist impulse and not
*  permissiveness? No, it depends from place to place. You know, there's the Hayek who actually likes,
*  you know, democracy and discussion and sees freedom of thought. And there's the Hayek who
*  thinks that you need a like Kurgan moment in order to destroy socialism and reestablish the
*  constitution of liberty, which is primarily economic liberty on its own foundation, on solid
*  foundations and his hopes that Augusto Pinochet would be that kind of guy from Chile.
*  But he was right about that, right? Chile is today a democracy. They did make the transition
*  that Hayek had predicted. No, I'm with Maggie Thatcher on this, that definitely other roads
*  in keeping with British constitutional traditions, I believe she wrote,
*  can achieve all that is good about such goals. You know, that
*  he's a complex guy who got crankier and crankier with age. And, you know, he was a genius with
*  respect to seeing the, you know, when I want to annoy my left wing friends, I want to say that if
*  they want to learn how to truly crowdsource anything, they need to look at Hayek. That what
*  they're pushing for is a central plan system in which someone at the top orders everyone around
*  as if they were robots and does so at no information or a bureaucracy unit, a bunch of people have
*  written the rule book that requires everyone else to be a software bot when the rule book only covers
*  one third of the possible cases, you know, or a market with private property and contract
*  and individual initiative so that all of the decision making is pushed out to the periphery
*  of society where the information and the brains really are. And how you automatically solve the
*  problem of incentivization as long as you manage to successfully align market prices with social
*  values. If there is no better way for harnessing the eight billion brain anthology intelligence of
*  humanity to achieving the social goals we all want other than to organize a well-functioning market
*  system. And, you know, that is a basic and serious truth. The problem, though, is the kind of aligned
*  prices with social values, you know, and the fact that in a real market the only rights that matter
*  are property rights. And so unless you are very, very good at making the distribution of property
*  rights in accord so that the people who control those property rights are issuing orders to the
*  market that accord with what you believe utopia requires, then you get yourself into huge trouble.
*  Plus you have to take care of all the externalities, you know, the information
*  externalities, the direct externalities, the macroeconomic externalities, and so forth.
*  If today we were to rerun a new Julian Simon versus Paul Ehrlich bet, which side would you take?
*  I would definitely take Simon's side. Why Simon?
*  We are extremely inventive. We have eight billion of us. We can talk. We're very, very smart
*  collectively. And so if the problem is to figure out how we can use resources in order to support
*  productivity, we are highly, highly likely to find a way that problems of environmental
*  catastrophe and pollution and so forth are problems of externalities and the proper
*  management of commons. They aren't problems that natural resources that are physical objects
*  are suddenly somehow going to become scarce. You know, the only example I seriously know about this
*  is the extinction of the spiced silphium in the Roman Empire.
*  And I still do not understand how it could have possibly happened because as silphium got scarce
*  for one of the many latipundistas of imperial Roman Italy to have established a silphium
*  plantation would have seemed to be a very obvious thing to do. What is your current view of the
*  middle income trap? So you're on an optimistic note. China looks like it's falling into it.
*  You know, I mean, we've
*  long known about the resource trap, right? You mean from having too much oil?
*  Yeah, that you get a society where the returns to engaging in positive some kind of let's win-win
*  figure out how to cooperate productively. If you're a young man or woman on the make are less than
*  the returns from figuring out how to join some force and fraud exploitation and domination machine,
*  which, you know, in the modern age is usually powered by foreign demand from someone elsewhere
*  who is richer. Right? You know, the drug lords in Latin America and the United States,
*  the oil lords in the Middle East and the European Union and so forth.
*  The middle income trap looks to me a lot like that thing expanding,
*  you know, expanding its reach. That, you know, governmental technology of appropriation improves
*  along with other technologies. And so there comes a point where it's better and easier and more
*  comfortable for yourself to try to join the government regimentation machine than to be out
*  there in the kind of entrepreneurial and positive some machine.
*  And so my understanding of the middle income trap is that that's where it comes from, you know, and
*  it's it seems scarily persistent, right? But I used to argue that divergence worldwide was largely
*  the result of, you know, internal and external colonialism, you know, plus Lenin, right? That
*  if you were externally colonized, your colonizer really didn't care about your economic development.
*  And if you were internally colonized by, say, an elite that regarded the rest of society as its
*  prey and thought it was separate because they were descended from the conquistadores of Castile,
*  they regarded the rest of the country as not just their prey, but the acquisition of knowledge and
*  social power by the rest of the country is absolutely dangerous. And you combine that with,
*  you know, Lenin's extraordinary success at organization and his pupils and their theological
*  belief that the market must be damned to hell forever. And you get almost all of the divergence
*  that we've seen since 1807. And then in the generation after World War II, I could say,
*  well, you know, failure to converge after the end of colonialism, that's because they've kind of
*  destroyed state institutions and building a state is a complicated thing. And you have to reward
*  and you have to reward your friends in order to maintain control and establish like Henry VIII
*  stole the monasteries. And, you know, stealing entrepreneurial wealth is a good thing to do
*  if you're trying to maintain a stable state and things will settle down. And then I could say,
*  well, African retardation, there are special problems of sub-Saharan Africa related to long
*  run destruction of social trust and so forth. But, you know, now I've kind of run out of excuses
*  for why middle income and other traps persist. And, you know, maybe the fact that I've run out
*  of excuses is tied is combined with the fact that we've actually seen substantial convergence
*  in the world since 2000. But, you know, on the other hand, the coming of Xi Jinping's
*  new imperial China and the coming of Nehendri Modi and what looks a lot to me like national Hinduist
*  India to India, those make me think that, you know, perhaps the middle income trap will be,
*  will continue to be much stronger than I would wish or then I had hoped five years ago when I
*  was in the mood of I've run out of excuses. Now you served in treasury under the Clinton administration.
*  Let's say you're called into the UK and maybe you have been. So the trust regime tries a mix
*  of spending hikes and tax cuts and markets don't like it. You're asked for advice. There's probably
*  a recession coming. Is it that you actually recommend austerity? What is it you tell them
*  to do right now? Oh, boy. That's a good question. That's a hard question.
*  You know, that is, I confess I was surprised by the fact that the fiscal theory of the price
*  level suddenly showed up outside of Whitehall and camped out and set up its tent. I understand. Such
*  an impressive what and, you know, it's the problem of is the fiscal theory price level really true
*  or have we have the wrong group of people in charge of money in financial markets?
*  And they're dead to the ratio. It's only at 80 percent, right? That is the people, the people who have,
*  you know, I mean, Milton Friedman hoped that noise traders would lose money and go away,
*  right? Simply because they were being irrational. And, you know, it was Larry Summers who pointed
*  out that rational people don't maximize expected wealth. They maximize utility. And, you know, as a
*  result of that insight of his, I actually have had a good career in economics, which I might well not
*  have had otherwise being as scatterbrained as I am. But I think that insight is much deeper. It's not
*  just that there'll be a lot of noise. Noise trading will be persistent. It will be that the largest
*  and most influential financial players will be people who have not only taken, you know, positions
*  that are overly risky in a beta sense, they will be overwhelmingly people who have massively failed
*  to diversify and who have been very lucky three times in a row and who as a result think that
*  they're absolute geniuses that we're selecting for a market in which the celebrity participants, at
*  least, are people with positively bad financial judgments. And that's the kind of market that
*  prone to bubbles and enthusiasms. And relatively right-wing in their politics because, you know,
*  the right wing will offer them low taxes. The great and good financially of Britain have been
*  told for 15 years that austerity is an important thing to have. And so that's why you need to have
*  us rather than the Labour Party in control. As near as I can see, the result has been a Britain
*  that's 10% poorer as a result of a failure to make public and private investments over the past
*  decade and a half and another 10% poorer because of the disaster of Brexit that was never supposed
*  to happen. It was just supposed to demonstrate that Boris Johnson was on the side of the little
*  people of England. You know, and maybe the fiscal theory of the price level was only there because
*  they believed what Cameron had told them and that maybe you could actually bowl through this.
*  If I were advising Liz Truss, I would say go back and tell the European Union it was all some
*  horrible mistake. We've come to our senses. They wouldn't take them back at this point,
*  right? They can't credibly commit to staying in all the time.
*  They can't credibly commit to staying in, but still they can, you know,
*  and it is the only obvious thing to do to massively raise British total factor productivity
*  is to get back into the European Union quickly. Otherwise, I do think you need,
*  you need a substantial boost of public investment. It would be very nice to take advantage of the
*  forthcoming recession to actually get it done. You know, when private spending sits down,
*  public spending should stand up. There needs to be a long run plan to definitely finance it,
*  given that as, you know, John Maynard Keynes said, the animal spirits of investors, that the animal
*  spirits of investors depend very much on investors' attitude, tour, and confidence in the soundness of
*  the government, and a hatred of investors for Leon Blumberg, the Labour Party, is a powerful factor
*  that must be taken into account. You know,
*  I would indeed say that a conservative government that promises, you know, a few that makes
*  incredibly promise substantial future wealth taxes to keep the deficit under control in the future
*  is the right road forward to Britain. I do not see how the conservative party as it's currently
*  constituted can make such long run promises, and I certainly do not think that, you know,
*  those whose credibility is needed for Britain to avoid a very nasty inflationary spiral over the
*  next 10 or 15 years would trust the Labour Party at all. What's your favorite novel?
*  We're likely to find that, you know, what happened to Leon Blom? Or what happened to the
*  Leon Blom? Or what happened to Francois Mitterrand? You know, attempt to move left and find yourself
*  having to tack right very, very quickly. What's your favorite novel? I would still say, I would
*  still say it's Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, but I'm not sure whether that is actually my
*  favorite novel or whether that is a novel that reminds me of one of my favorite times.
*  Or is there a real difference between them? Yes. What is your favorite movie?
*  I'd have to say I'm a sap, and I still have to say that I admire Casablanca extraordinarily much.
*  I wish my favorite movie were The Seven Samurai, but when I'm sitting down, even when I'm not
*  exhausted and actually want to watch a favorite movie, I do find myself turning to Casablanca,
*  so I revealed preference. Do you think there's any novel or movie that is really quite good for
*  understanding economics? Or is the scene versus unseen distinction too much of a distortion?
*  That in novels and movies, there's too much intent and not enough invisible hand?
*  Oh, I would actually say Red Plenty. I would say Red Plenty by Francis Buffard is a wonderful novel
*  about economics. What's your favorite video or computer game right now?
*  What's your favorite video or computer game right now?
*  Oh, I don't have a favorite computer game. Civilization? Gone?
*  I don't dare. Yes, yes, yes. I mean, as I say, the fact that in late 1993, I had to decide between
*  being a civilization addict and a deputy assistant secretary of the treasury. And do you know,
*  at least if I'd managed to figure out how to win consistently at God level in civilization,
*  I might feel I had accomplished more than I did at the treasury. I might not.
*  Yeah, but I microwaved the disk and have not gotten played a video game since.
*  It's not something I trust myself with.
*  Does UC Berkeley have the right amount of intellectual diversity?
*  Does UC Berkeley? If it were the only Berkeley, I would say yes.
*  I would say that a American educational system that has even 20 places
*  in which I'm as far right on the faculty as I am at UC Berkeley would not be a terribly healthy
*  situation. And I think we're in that situation. How much has religion influenced your political
*  and economic views, if at all? I would say formally and
*  consciously not. The problem is that I know too much about the genealogy of
*  a great many ideas I hold to be very dear. So I would say unconsciously, absolutely enormously.
*  And what from Christianity or elsewhere do you think you've drawn upon the most?
*  I might say you should ask Rabbi Hillel to teach you the importance of religion.
*  I might say you should ask Rabbi Hillel to teach you the entire Torah while standing on one foot.
*  You know, that that's what is hateful to others, do not do to them.
*  Or maybe Bill and Ted, you know, be excellent to each other and party on dudes.
*  So Kantianism, but filtered through religion.
*  Well, except I would say religion is filtered through Kant and emerges as Kantianism.
*  Sure. I would say that it comes from elsewhere.
*  He had his own pietistic background, right? That's probably not a coincidence.
*  Yes. The history of this book, if I understand it correctly, there's a director's cut of this book
*  hidden away somewhere. Is that correct? I have not yet managed to assemble the
*  director's cut. There's a cutting room floor. It has 600 pages, including index and so forth.
*  There are another 400 pages that exist in draft that exist that exists in disorganized form.
*  And then there are the notes and quotations and outlines for another 500 pages.
*  Will we ever see that?
*  The Lord willing and the creek don't rise. Yes.
*  You know, the question is, which part should I which part should I add to and come out next?
*  Should it be the one that's really about industrial research labs and modes of production since 1870?
*  Should it be the history of the Malthusian world?
*  You know, should it be the parallel to the unbound Prometheus?
*  Or should it be very much the Shumpeterian industrial creative destruction book?
*  People can vote. Send me emails with your votes.
*  And last question, what else might you be planning in addition to possible sequels?
*  Oh, um, to write, I would say that possible sequels is pretty much all that I'm planning right now.
*  But substack, you're going to stay on substack, go back to blogging, do more on Twitter. There's
*  other choices, right?
*  Substacking is blogging, except that substacking is blogging where you have a lot of time to
*  do it. And it's also blogging where you have explicit permission to send things to people's
*  email inboxes. And also to have a rather large tip jar.
*  And is substack or blogging better? Substack, the post seems longer to me.
*  Blogging, it seems shorter and more about scrolling. Which do you prefer?
*  I thought blogging was more fun. I like being a squirrel.
*  I think if, you know, if you believe Ezra Klein, that we need to be more Gutenberg-ish, because the
*  social media audio visual world is really one in which you have to declare who are your enemies in
*  order to get listened to. And that that really is not a healthy foundation for a public sphere.
*  I think I have a moral obligation to help Hamish and Company push substack forward in the future.
*  And that it would be nice if they succeed in their long run project for world domination.
*  Brad DeLong, thank you very much. And again, everyone, the new book is Slouching Towards Utopia,
*  An Economic History of the 20th Century.
*  Yes. And thank you very much, Tyler, for inviting me. And please read and think about and, you know,
*  criticize the book and criticize the book, please, harshly and mercilessly. Because that's about
*  one of the few ways I'm going to learn things. And what's left of my life is to read incisive
*  and merciless critiques of my book. And I definitely do want not to stop learning things.
*  I think you're too hard on Hayek. That's my critique for today. But Brad, thank you very much.
*  And look forward to seeing you next.
