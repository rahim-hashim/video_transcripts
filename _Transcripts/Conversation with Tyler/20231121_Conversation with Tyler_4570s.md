Video Description: How did religious freedom emerge — and why did it arrive so late? In their forthcoming book, fellow Mason economists Noel Johnson and Mark Koyama argue that while most focus on the role of liberal ideas in establishing religious freedom, it was instead institutional changes — and the growth of state capacity in particular — that played the decisive role.
 
In their conversation with Tyler, Johnson and Koyama discuss the ‘long road to religious freedom’ and more, including the link between bad weather and Jewish persecution, why China evolved into such a large political unit, whether the Black Death proves Paul Romer wrong, scapegoating, usury prohibitions in history, and the economic impact of volcanic eruptions.

# Noel Johnson and Mark Koyama on *Persecution and Toleration* | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38)
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=0.0s)]
*  bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=8.32s)]
*  Learn more at mercatus.org. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=12.52s)]
*  And for more conversations, including videos, transcripts, and upcoming dates, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  visit conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=19.82s)]
*  Hello. Today we're doing a Conversations with Tyler with two authors of a new book called [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=30.8s)]
*  Persecution and Toleration, The Long Road to Religious Freedom, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=36.8s)]
*  published by Cambridge University Press. They also happen to be two of my favorite colleagues [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=40.72s)]
*  at George Mason and Mercatus. They're both very well-known economic historians. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=46.24s)]
*  And today we have with us Noel Johnson and Mark Koyama. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=51.6s)]
*  We're going to start with Noel Johnson. Ready? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm ready. Thank you for having me on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=58.88s)]
*  A lot of historians have suggested that anti-Semitism picked up in the Renaissance [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  compared to medieval times. Is that true? And if so, why did that happen? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=65.76s)]
*  So by the time of the Renaissance, anti-Semitism was picking up. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=70.48s)]
*  So one myth that a lot of people believe is that there was a tremendous amount of religious [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=74.4s)]
*  persecution that was going on during, say, the early Middle Ages to the late Middle Ages, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  up until, say, 1200 or 1300. By the time you get to the Renaissance, there is more tension [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=87.44s)]
*  that's emerging in Europe, in part because of states growing more powerful, rise in state [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=94.96s)]
*  capacity. So states are expanding their territory. States are attempting to impose themselves more [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=102.96s)]
*  in different parts of life. And this is starting to generate certain tensions. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=109.2s)]
*  This is sometimes called the rise of the persecuting state. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=114.8s)]
*  If I think of the Renaissance as overall more capitalistic than the Middle Ages, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=118.32s)]
*  then there's a kind of paradox that arises in my mind. It seems that across countries at any point [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=123.44s)]
*  in time, the more capitalistic countries seem to be more tolerant. The Dutch Republic later, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=128.32s)]
*  the Netherlands, England, United States. But when you view it as a time series, it seems that you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=133.2s)]
*  get more capitalism or more advanced state structures and then more anti-Semitism. How [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=139.36s)]
*  do I square those two tendencies, or am I wrong? No, I don't think you're wrong. So part of this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=144.4s)]
*  whole process, as we go through in the book, I like to think of it as three phases that Europe [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=151.52s)]
*  is going through. And they're not necessarily the same phases that every other part of the world has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=157.68s)]
*  to go through. But in Europe, you have an initial phase where individuals are being categorized [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  according to identity rules. They're being placed into legal categories and social categories that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=168.8s)]
*  it's based on things like their religious identity. Jewish communities are one of the easiest groups [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=174.96s)]
*  to identify this with. They're forced to live in the same place. They're forced to wear different [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=180.8s)]
*  kinds of clothes. They can do different sorts of occupations. So this is an equilibrium at first. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  And during this time, you observe relatively little persecution of these groups. And one reason [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=193.6s)]
*  is because they're just not, they're in their place. And so there's not the same tension, you [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=199.76s)]
*  know, that's being generated there. And also they're serving a purpose in the often for Jews, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=205.2s)]
*  for example, in the sense that they are raising money for non-Jews. Like so for towns, they might [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=210.56s)]
*  grant Jews the monopoly right to lend money. But then of course, Jews make monopoly profit [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=217.36s)]
*  from lending at higher interest rates. But of course, the Jews don't get to keep this money. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=223.44000000000003s)]
*  And it's taken by say the town burgers, and then they're taxed. This is actually a very, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  a rather pernicious equilibrium because you also get a cultural byproduct, you know, which is that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  Jews are perceived as Shylocks, you know, lending at excessive interest rates. And this generates [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism, which in turn makes it easier for them to be taxed by the secular authority or by [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=246.0s)]
*  the Christian authorities. So that equilibrium, you don't necessarily see a tremendous amount [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=251.68s)]
*  of persecution yet. However, every now and then that breaks down and you do. But then what starts [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=257.84s)]
*  to happen as you get into the Renaissance and as you have, and especially as you get more towards [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=264.8s)]
*  the Reformation, you have states expanding. So one example that I, and this is the next phase, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=271.28s)]
*  right, you know, where you're moving out of these identity rules where importantly, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=277.52s)]
*  you don't have to have strong states in that world. You can rely on, often you mentioned [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=280.64s)]
*  capital, you can rely on market mechanisms often in order to run your state, right, tax farming, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=287.28s)]
*  you know, or subcontracting to Jews, you know, to raise money for you, these sorts of things. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=292.88s)]
*  This puts them in a precarious position, but there's not a tremendous amount of persecution [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=297.11999999999995s)]
*  that comes out of it. As you have the states expanding their role, these sorts of institutional [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=301.04s)]
*  arrangements start to break down at the same time. And this is often when you see the largest [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=308.24s)]
*  amounts of persecution that are taking place. So what's the key change here that state power [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  is being contested and it's pretty strong or is it something else? The key point is that you have [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=319.6s)]
*  a situation, well, first of all, you have economic dynamism, you know, so that there are other [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=325.92s)]
*  individuals who want to say trade, you know, long distance and they're running up against Jews for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=330.24s)]
*  these sorts of things. You have other people who want to be involved and say money lending, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, and they're running up against the Jews in these sorts of circumstances. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=339.2s)]
*  But you also have over time, you have sort of, for example, the state may want to, they might bring [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=342.72s)]
*  in more people, right, you know, like, you know, conquer more territory. So the French might do [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  this, say, in the 16th century or 15th century. And as they're doing this, they are also [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  realizing that they have a lot more difference, a lot more identities in their midst than they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=361.68s)]
*  knew before. And this can generate more persecution. An example that Marc Raymond and I have written [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=366.56s)]
*  about in this case would be, say, the Albigensian Crusades, to take a non-Jewish example. So this is [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=372.64s)]
*  something that's building at the end of the 12th century, so the end of the 1100s, and then by [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=379.36s)]
*  the beginning of the 13th century, you have the French state expanding its power into the south. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=384.16s)]
*  And then as they do this, they run into this group of religious, a different religious group [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=390.72s)]
*  which becomes known as Cathars, right, were not necessarily really that different, but they were [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=397.6s)]
*  different enough that they could use this as an excuse to conquer the territory and take them over. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=402.72s)]
*  So this is a case where the rules kind of run into this heterogeneity, right. And so you get [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=409.04s)]
*  persecution, and that's the state's building power, you know, that's generating some persecution. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=413.84s)]
*  So it's the cross-connection between states building power, there being something at stake, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=418.56s)]
*  and there's more heterogeneity than there had been in the earlier, more zero-sum environment. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=423.35999999999996s)]
*  Right. And then at this point, the state, they, somebody in the state, because states don't make [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=428.32s)]
*  decisions, but there's some group in it that has to make a decision, right, about do we want to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=432.55999999999995s)]
*  impose the old system? Do we want to have the same rules that we had before, where we were [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  getting religious legitimation, but we were trying to adhere to some sort of dogma in doing this? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=442.48s)]
*  Or do we have to relax the bounds of tolerance, because we're either running into this more [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=447.76s)]
*  greater heterogeneity because we're expanding, or because we have to, in some sense, build our [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=452.0s)]
*  state in a different way. Okay. So at least for a small group, maybe a small group of bad people, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=457.92s)]
*  but scapegoating is a kind of public good. You blame something on a minority, say. How does that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  public good of scapegoating get produced? So it can either come from the top down, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=469.2s)]
*  or it can come from the bottom up. But in the period you study, what's the main mechanism [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=473.76s)]
*  that a political leader uses scapegoating to increase his power, her power? Well, this is a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=478.56s)]
*  complicated question. It can be both. I'll take a specific example. So again, if we stick to the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=484.88s)]
*  13th century, right, which is right before this Renaissance period you're talking about, I forget [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=490.08s)]
*  the exact year, but I believe the Jews are expelled from England around 1290 or so, and so as the whole [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=495.12s)]
*  state, you know, does it. We don't know exactly why this occurs, but there's a lot going on in [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=501.12s)]
*  the 13th century between nobles in England, say, and the crown, right? You have Magna Carta at the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=506.96s)]
*  beginning. You have the First Barons War. You have the Second Barons War that are taking place at [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=513.92s)]
*  the beginning of the 13th century. And what a lot of these wars, these civil disturbances are about [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=518.24s)]
*  you have nobles who are having taxes extracted from them. They're having revenue extracted from [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=525.2s)]
*  them by the king. And these individuals also know that Jews are involved in the extractor, right? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=531.2s)]
*  And they want to exploit the Jews and take over both the revenue streams that the Jews have and [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=539.04s)]
*  also get rid of some of their debts. So you ask that in that case, we don't know for sure, but one [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=544.64s)]
*  reasonable explanation that's almost certainly playing a part in the eventual expulsion of Jews [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=550.96s)]
*  in 1290 is that this is a credible way for the king to give something to the nobles so that they- [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=556.08s)]
*  So it's expelling the competition. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  Expelling competition. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=565.52s)]
*  So you're willing even to expel a useful scapegoat if you can hand out rents. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  Right. Although, yes, in this case, but I have to say, I think one of the more interesting questions [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  that somebody can ask that I do not fully understand, and I'm not sure anybody does right [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=575.36s)]
*  now, is why do you expel Jews necessarily? So we've done, Mark and I have done a lot of work [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=580.24s)]
*  on building data sets of Jewish persecution and Jewish expulsions at the city level and the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=587.28s)]
*  country level in Europe over a very long period of time. And a question that I, for one, don't [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=591.92s)]
*  fully understand is you don't need to actually kill all the Jews or expel them in order to extract [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=598.16s)]
*  resources from them. And in fact, in some way, this is off equilibrium path, right? You're no longer [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=604.08s)]
*  in some optimal equilibrium for both the ruler and for the Jewish community. And so, and oftentimes, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=610.4s)]
*  these Jewish communities would be expelled from a city, they would be invited to come back, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=615.84s)]
*  and they would come back, right? You know, in five, 10, 15 years, sometimes even shorter, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=619.12s)]
*  but that's a little bit easier to understand. So that's actually, in the case I gave you in England, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=623.92s)]
*  you know, in the 1290s, I think I understand a little bit, you know, about why it might have [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=629.12s)]
*  happened that way. And I think it was signaling credibility in some political compact between the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=633.36s)]
*  king and the nobles, but I'm not sure. But that's an example of top down. Other times, clearly, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=638.48s)]
*  people are, you just have, say, guilds moving against these Jewish communities. So an example [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=644.08s)]
*  of this would be in 1614, when the most well-known Jewish persecutions was in Frankfurt online. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=651.12s)]
*  It was called the Fetmilk Massacre. And Fetmilk was a baker. He was in guilds. And he was upset [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=658.08s)]
*  about the terms of the political deal between the city rulers, the city council, and what the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=666.48s)]
*  guilds were getting, okay? And one of the things that the guilds wanted were the Jews to be expelled, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=674.08s)]
*  and this was competition in some sense. And in your investigation, when the weather turns cold [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=681.36s)]
*  and the harvest gets worse, Jews and other groups are persecuted more in these societies. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=687.76s)]
*  Sometimes it's suggested that the parts of Europe relatively close to Islam [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=693.52s)]
*  were more tolerant of the Jews. Is that true? And if so, how does it fit your model? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  Matthew 26 The Ottoman Empire I can speak directly to on this, but that's not what your question is. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=702.24s)]
*  You're wondering about parts of Europe here. So you're like Albania? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  Richard 27 Possibly. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  Matthew 26 Which is part of the... [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=711.36s)]
*  Richard 27 Bulgaria after it's no longer part of the Ottoman Empire. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  Matthew 26 Yeah, yeah. I actually don't know. I'm not sure I have a good answer for that. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  The Ottoman Empire, I could talk a lot about the Dimi system and how that works into [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=721.36s)]
*  my thinking on this. But I mean, aside from I know something like Albania was part of the Ottoman [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=726.32s)]
*  Empire at one point, right? And some of these regions, I know, and this isn't closer to the [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=732.4s)]
*  Ottoman Empire in my mind, but Poland has a much different equilibrium with Jews that emerges. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=738.0s)]
*  And I have a story for that, but that's not about Islam. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=743.28s)]
*  Richard 27 What's the Poland story? That's fine. I'm interested in the Poland story. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=746.32s)]
*  Matthew 28 But now I've opened another... It's a complicated one. So Poland is... [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=749.5200000000001s)]
*  Richard 27 But at its essence. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  Matthew 28 Yeah, yeah. In essence, in Poland, you see over time a gradual movement of Jewish [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  communities from the Iberian Peninsula is where they initially come in. And then they're moving [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=759.84s)]
*  towards the West. Okay? And many are ending up in Poland. And Poland is often claimed to be a state [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  without stakes in the sense that it's not a persecuting society in the way that other European [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=771.84s)]
*  areas were. And the story that Mark and I tell about Poland, and I believe, is that they actually [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=779.28s)]
*  had very weak state authority in Poland. And Jews were... And Poland also never really... They [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=787.8399999999999s)]
*  experienced something called the Second Serfdom. So after the Black Death... [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=797.28s)]
*  Richard 28 Give us a time period? Okay. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=801.28s)]
*  Matthew 28 Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah. So after 1350 is when the Black Death is occurring around then. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=802.56s)]
*  And Europe loses about 40% of its population to this bacterial infection that spreads through. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=807.52s)]
*  And as anybody who's taken introductory economics might suggest, when the labor supply goes down by [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=814.24s)]
*  a lot, you know, with 40% of Europe dying, then wages are going to start going up. And this means [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=820.4s)]
*  the bargaining power of peasants relative to, say, landowners and so forth, they're going to increase. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=825.92s)]
*  However, what economists often don't take into account is one response to this might be for [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=832.72s)]
*  people in power to double down on keeping peasants under their thumb. So the Second Serfdom in Eastern [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=840.08s)]
*  Europe, Poland, I'm thinking in particular, this is that instead of getting better deals, the peasants [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=847.0400000000001s)]
*  were made... They were put under even greater submission after the Black Death because they [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=853.6800000000001s)]
*  were not able to get the market wage. So power played a role there with the nobility. And the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=858.16s)]
*  nobility would often take advantage of Jews' skills in, say, monitoring labor, keeping books, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=864.4s)]
*  these sorts of things to help them run this situation. So you have sorts of court Jews, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  Jews who were integrated into that power structure in that area, not all of them by any means. And [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=879.04s)]
*  the story changes dramatically as you move into the 19th and 20th centuries. But Poland never [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=883.44s)]
*  really goes through these transformations of developing state capacity. And Jews remain in [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=890.0s)]
*  this identity equilibrium in Poland, which insulates them from the persecution that we observe [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=896.0s)]
*  at the time, like so say, 14th century, 1500s up to 1800 or so that we see in the other parts of [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=904.32s)]
*  Europe. But of course, you don't get the emergence of a true sense of a true form of tolerance. And [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=911.52s)]
*  this comes back doubly bad or much, much worse in the 19th and into the 20th century. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=916.88s)]
*  You mentioned the Black Death. Let's go back to 1347, which I think is when it all starts. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=922.64s)]
*  What institutional changes did the Black Death bring to Western Europe? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=927.68s)]
*  That's a big question. So... [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=931.52s)]
*  But kind of the simplest answer for someone who knows nothing. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=933.28s)]
*  Yeah. So the simplest institutional changes that are coming about because of the Black Death [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  are going to be related to... So what I've looked at are first of what happens to Jews in the Black [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  Death, but more broadly what's occurring is you get this, you lose a tremendous amount of population [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  and it's a pure demographic shock in this sense, which we don't often see in history. And this is [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=955.04s)]
*  going to change the bargaining power, the relative bargaining power of people with workers compared [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=961.76s)]
*  to nobles or people who are running states and cities and these sorts of things. And so [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=969.28s)]
*  you're going to see more power for these individuals. Well, one of the biggest changes [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=976.64s)]
*  that's going to happen is you're going to see the emergence of more trading cities in the North [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  relative to the South. And this is going to play a big role in generating the economic equilibrium [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=984.4s)]
*  that comes about from the next couple hundred years. But the main thing that's going on with [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=991.68s)]
*  institutional change is going to be this shift in the bargaining power that's letting peasants [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  have more power relative to nobles. If the Black Death raised wages, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1003.68s)]
*  does that mean that immigration today lowers wages? Not necessarily. So yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  You would think, right? So the Black Death, first of all, this was... We have a hard time, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1013.92s)]
*  I have a hard time wrapping my head around the numbers. So this is almost half of the population [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1018.56s)]
*  that is dying. And it's not occurring in a uniform way across all of Europe. Some cities disappear, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  some cities get hardly affected by this, which is interesting for other reasons. But it's a huge [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1030.8s)]
*  shock. And I don't think we really have examples in the modern period of immigration on that level. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  And I know from the literature on immigration, which I'm not an expert in, but typically these [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1043.92s)]
*  movements are not so large that we see them radically affecting wages in the way that I'm [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1049.92s)]
*  talking about. I mean, these are... Initially when the Black Death hits, the world is ending, right? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  You have wages, wages don't go up, production just breaks down, right? Like every second person or [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1062.72s)]
*  so is dead, right? And so there's disintermediation, like to use a modern word, like in a massive way. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1069.28s)]
*  Sure. Wages go up at all. Does that mean Paul Romer is wrong about increasing returns? Because [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1076.72s)]
*  you might think, well, you lose half your people, society falls apart, everyone's wages fall. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1082.8799999999999s)]
*  Clearly that's not what happened, but it's what I would expect if you asked me a priori. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1087.92s)]
*  So Paul Romer is wrong, there are not increasing returns, you can just have higher wages and be [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1092.08s)]
*  much smaller. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think Paul Romer is right. And in fact, I think one of the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1096.72s)]
*  things about the Black Death that's nice is that we can test some theories of increasing returns [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1100.88s)]
*  using it. Something that, again, Mark Ramon, Remy Yedwab and I have been working on is looking at [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1105.84s)]
*  the Black Death as a test of theories of urban agglomeration, which is very much related to [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1112.32s)]
*  increasing returns in the way that you bring up. So one thing that you can look at if you want to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1116.64s)]
*  tell whether or not increasing returns are one of the main reasons why you have cities in the place [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1122.96s)]
*  they are, that is, are people in cities where they are because that's where all the people are, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1127.28s)]
*  right, is you can take the people away and then see if they move to a different location that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1132.32s)]
*  might have something tied to geography or tied to space, which is better. So for example, you might, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1136.56s)]
*  what I just mentioned is that there is a general shift towards northern trading networks. We know [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1143.52s)]
*  because of what we've been looking at that the Hanseatic cities, which is a trading network [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1148.16s)]
*  that exists on the Baltic in the north of Europe, those cities recovered much more quickly [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1154.96s)]
*  than cities in the south, cities tied to the old Roman road network that's centered on the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1160.0s)]
*  Mediterranean, for example. And this makes sense if you think that trade has been shifting with [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1164.96s)]
*  wool trade, for example, over time, since the collapse of Rome. But then if you have increasing [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1171.2s)]
*  returns, you're not going to immediately see this shift in the urban network. But if you take away, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1177.28s)]
*  on average, 40% of the population of the cities, then this allows you to let people reshuffle, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1183.04s)]
*  right? You know, and in effect, this did happen to a certain extent. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1189.52s)]
*  Confiscating land from the church during the French Revolution. Did it enhance economic value or not? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1193.44s)]
*  I believe it did. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1199.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1200.32s)]
*  And so I get in trouble for this because on the one hand, so what happened, right, you know, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1200.8s)]
*  during the French Revolution is that the state, well, the revolutionaries decided that they needed [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1205.6s)]
*  money, you know, to issue. And so they issued these things called Asenya, and they wanted to [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1211.36s)]
*  back it with a real asset. And so the real asset that they decided to back this paper money with [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1216.0s)]
*  was land confiscated from the church. They also took a bunch from Emigre, but that's a slightly [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1220.9599999999998s)]
*  different story that we can talk about if you want later. But the church land they take, and there's [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1226.8799999999999s)]
*  a tremendous amount of land owned by the church in France, it approaches up to 7% or so of the land [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1231.04s)]
*  that's there. And then they issued this paper money initially, they backed on this. Then they do this, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1237.76s)]
*  and then they have an auction, you know, to distribute this land. So I get in trouble because [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1244.48s)]
*  sometimes people hear me say that the auctions of this land was good, and they say, well, he's just [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1249.36s)]
*  a GMU economist and markets are always good, and that's good. But you have to remember, they also [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1253.28s)]
*  confiscated all the land, right? So there's a few things going on here. So they distribute this land [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1257.36s)]
*  by auction, okay? And when they do this, auctions are pretty good mechanisms to put an asset into [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1263.04s)]
*  a hands of somebody who values it most. And there's an active secondary market that goes on for this [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  land. And the way that my co authors on this paper, who are Teresa Finley and Raphael Frank, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1275.76s)]
*  the way we think about this process is that you have a set of feudal institutions and property [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  that exists up to about 1790 or something like this, the French Revolution, early phases. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1287.2s)]
*  And in that feudal system, you have lots of overlapping property rights. So for example, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1292.88s)]
*  if I wanted to build an irrigation canal, you know, or make some improvement to my land, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1298.32s)]
*  I might have to negotiate with multiple parties to do this because they all have some stake in [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1303.8400000000001s)]
*  what I'm doing to my land. So everybody is having these institutions wiped out in effect, you know, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1309.28s)]
*  when the revolution comes. However, it's only a subset of the properties that are immediately put [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1316.72s)]
*  on the market and then auctioned off to individuals and falling into the hands of the people who value [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1322.88s)]
*  the most, which what we find is that those people ultimately started to consolidate the land. And [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1328.24s)]
*  they also started making investments in things like irrigation and drainage and having better crop [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1333.52s)]
*  rotation systems and so forth. So what that really is, it's a story about what economists are familiar [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1340.16s)]
*  with, the Coase theorem. So the Coase theorem stated simply says that if there are low enough [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1345.84s)]
*  transactions costs, low enough costs of trading, then it doesn't actually matter [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1352.8s)]
*  who owns an asset initially, people will trade it and you'll end up with the best possible. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1357.52s)]
*  We could grab a church on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, sell it off and GDP would go up, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1362.0s)]
*  Yeah. But what economists often ignore is that the transaction costs are very high, right, you know, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1366.48s)]
*  to doing this. And what we have in the French Revolution is a natural experiment where for [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1371.12s)]
*  reasons unrelated to what I'm interested in, the revolutionaries decided to use a market mechanism [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1376.3999999999999s)]
*  to put a whole bunch of assets out there with very low transaction costs. And you see that the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1381.12s)]
*  productivity of agriculture in places that had more church land that was auctioned off [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1386.8s)]
*  was higher than places that didn't have this happen up until the end of the 19th century, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1391.28s)]
*  as we might expect, because over time, all these assets, you know, are being reallocated and [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1397.6s)]
*  investments are ultimately being made. So I do think in that case, this was a circumstance where [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1402.08s)]
*  you had a land redistribution that led to greater efficiency. Why is Switzerland so wealthy and [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1407.76s)]
*  successful relative to the rest of Europe? That's a good question. I had a theory about this once [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1413.36s)]
*  and I gave I didn't pursue it. But my my initial my theory when I was in graduate school was that [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1418.32s)]
*  they were getting a large amount of specie flow because they had mercenaries out there and so [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1423.76s)]
*  they were being paid in gold. And then this trick created nascent institutions for banks, right, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1427.92s)]
*  you know, or gave them some advantage. I didn't actually look into that more deeply. So I don't [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1432.56s)]
*  know if that's true. But Swiss banking has declined a lot, as you know, it's also too early, like, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1437.28s)]
*  you know, they were very poor, right, up until, you know, the chemistry and these sorts of the [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1443.04s)]
*  chemical revolution and so forth. So so I said that was my old theory, right? I'm not sure much [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1448.4s)]
*  higher GDP per capita than most of the rest of Western Europe, maybe Luxembourg aside. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1452.72s)]
*  Yeah. And I think they have a it's actually it's a really interesting thing. They are able to [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1457.04s)]
*  they act like they're a culturally homogenous territory, which they are, but at the same time, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1463.44s)]
*  they have four different language groups, you know, packed into a relatively small place, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1469.2s)]
*  they have a lot of ruggedness, but that they still interact, right. And there's also if you look at [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1474.16s)]
*  the literature from people have looked at say, preferences over welfare. And there is there are [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1479.28s)]
*  big differences between German speaking and French speaking and Italian speaking regions [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1484.08s)]
*  within Switzerland. So I don't know the answer. I think there's something in there that has to do [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1488.16s)]
*  with size, that you know, that it can work in a place the size of Switzerland, they definitely [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  have a national identity, which is very strong. And I'm not sure exactly how that emerged. One [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1498.0s)]
*  could tell stories about the Swiss being surrounded, you know, for so long and cutting [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1504.32s)]
*  off the mountain passes, you know, and acting in this in this way that sometimes I hear these, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1510.72s)]
*  but otherwise, I actually don't know the answer. Large volcanic eruptions earlier in history. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1515.2s)]
*  From an economic point of view, what's the single most interesting thing we know about them? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1521.6799999999998s)]
*  So I think what's what's very interesting about the volcanic eruptions is that we are discovering [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1526.08s)]
*  more and more that they may have played a large role in political change that occurred. So Joe [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1532.56s)]
*  Manning at Yale, and I believe his graduate student who unfortunately I forgot his name, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1540.48s)]
*  have been doing work on they looked at a series of volcanic eruptions that led to the end of the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1545.6799999999998s)]
*  pharaonic empire. So that ended around 30 or 60 BC, I forget around right around that time. But [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1551.6799999999998s)]
*  that wasn't that was an empire that lasted for 300 years before. But they experienced all these [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1557.44s)]
*  crop failures. And then when to look at it, you see that in Indonesia, all these major volcanic [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1562.16s)]
*  eruptions were happening in perfect timing, you know, with these crop failures that were taking [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1566.64s)]
*  place. And actually, they can tell from looking at the Nile, you know, and how much it's flooding [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1570.72s)]
*  and things. We also know that politics becomes nastier when the volcano goes off. Well, if you [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1574.72s)]
*  think about the Egypt case, which is Manning, this is a circumstance where you have I believe it's a [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1579.92s)]
*  low rainfall, right. And so this causes which eruption, which year is this? This is around [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1587.84s)]
*  60 or 30 BC, I forget exactly when but a series of them around that time. And this is a when you [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1593.4399999999998s)]
*  you basically don't get the flooding of the Nile Delta, right, you know, the Nile region, and then [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1602.08s)]
*  this creates a collapse in agriculture. And then this creates revolts, you know, on the Nile at [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1605.84s)]
*  this time. And that's creating political pressure. The another example, you know, of this happening, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1611.6799999999998s)]
*  although one has to be careful. Another volcano that went off was in 1257, Samalas. And so this [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1617.36s)]
*  one I've looked at a little bit and actually, other people, you know, have been looking at this [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1623.9199999999998s)]
*  as well. The Samalas is happening right around the time of these barrens wars, you know, that [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1629.52s)]
*  I was talking particularly happens right before the second barrens war. And while people have been [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1635.76s)]
*  looking at it, you see that it's the timings not perfect, but it did pile on additional agricultural [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1641.28s)]
*  pressure on these nobles at a time when they were all discontented with the king's power. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1648.56s)]
*  But they might have been individually upset before, but now they're all becoming upset at the same time, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1656.24s)]
*  because you have crops failing, the king still acts asking for revenues, right. And they all are [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1661.6s)]
*  feeling the pressure at the same time, and you end up getting a coordinated political action [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1667.52s)]
*  against the rulers. Now, as it turns out, there happened to be bad weather occurring in the two [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1672.48s)]
*  years previous to Samalas as well. And so this wasn't just the volcano in that circumstance, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1677.52s)]
*  it was the volcano in addition to some other bad luck. But it's the environment, the climate, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1682.08s)]
*  right, playing a role in taking on an agency role in generating political change. And then [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1688.08s)]
*  through coordinating activity that I think is interesting. I think there's also something [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1692.96s)]
*  interesting to be said that these events, these large climatic events and large epidemiological [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1697.28s)]
*  events that I'm talking about, they also have a bias in that they tend to be worse when you have [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1702.4s)]
*  places that are networked together and people that are integrated. And so you could also look at say, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1709.28s)]
*  1815, there's another big volcano that goes off that's called Tambora. And in the case of Tambora, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1715.04s)]
*  you have market integration, more or less within Europe by 1815, meaning that when you have [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1722.4s)]
*  idiosyncratic shocks, climate shocks hitting places across Europe, you tend to have trade [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1729.2800000000002s)]
*  smoothing those over. And so you don't see it in grain prices very much or anything like this. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1735.68s)]
*  But when you have something like Tambora, which is a VI7, it's a very, very large volcano, the largest [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1740.0800000000002s)]
*  since Samalas in the 13th century, would go off. It shuts down. It makes it snow in Maine in June [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1746.72s)]
*  and all over the world because of all the particulates in the air and so forth, blocking the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1755.76s)]
*  sun in both 1816 and in 1817. And you see very much in that circumstance, the markets can't handle it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1760.96s)]
*  And so another project that I've been working on actively is trying to put together as much [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1769.84s)]
*  information as I can about that event and to basically see what was the effect that it had [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1775.52s)]
*  on these markets, what sort of effects did it have on how people were impacted with their health, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1784.08s)]
*  and basically to ask questions about how robust market institutions are to dealing with basically [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1791.2s)]
*  correlated supply shocks that are very, very large. And we really don't have many like that. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1798.08s)]
*  So I find that interesting as well. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1802.3200000000002s)]
*  Returning to your work on tolerance, a speculative question. If you think of [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  prejudice as having become worse when some stakes are higher and in some ways states are stronger [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1809.44s)]
*  and there's more heterogeneity on the table, are you optimistic or pessimistic about tolerance today? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1816.0800000000002s)]
*  That is, do you think we've cleared some hurdle and we're never headed back or do you think it's [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1822.96s)]
*  back and forth? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1827.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm optimistic. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1828.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1829.92s)]
*  I don't think so. So I'm optimistic about the United States and other well-established liberal [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1830.48s)]
*  democracies. I don't think we're going to head all the way back to a situation where, I mean, so [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1836.16s)]
*  the biggest danger is a totalitarian danger and we've already seen that happen. And that is [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1843.68s)]
*  totally, that is completely a danger, right? I do worry about some sort of Nazi type phenomena, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1849.6s)]
*  which could occur in like a Holocaust or something like this. And that can occur. However, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1856.08s)]
*  I think there is a general sense that's been absorbed into the culture, that this is no longer [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1862.24s)]
*  a thing that is acceptable. And I think that is a strong sense that still exists. And I think there [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1869.12s)]
*  are a lot of states that also feel strongly about this. I mean, even if you look at World War II, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1874.32s)]
*  the worst atrocities that occurred against Jews, they happened in the regions that had states that [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1880.64s)]
*  were weakened at the time during World War II. This is somewhat hidden. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1888.48s)]
*  This is a point made by Timothy Snyder. You know, it's not my own. And so that doesn't say, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1892.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, the Germans played a big role and they had a lot of high, very high state capacity. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1898.5600000000002s)]
*  But I mean, Hannah Arendt also has talked about similar points. It's the stateless people that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1902.5600000000002s)]
*  are the greatest risk, right? And if you have strong states in place, you're going to tend to [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1907.92s)]
*  have less of the persecution taking place, especially in the states can also work against [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1914.0s)]
*  each other. What I'm most pessimistic about is in a developing country context, you know, that I [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1917.76s)]
*  don't see any reason why a developing country, say Africa, is going to decide to adopt liberal [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1923.44s)]
*  values about toleration, just because they observe them in another place. I think they have to go [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1930.4s)]
*  through a somewhat similar process of building up state capacity and running into these practical [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1936.4s)]
*  reasons why a system of intolerance doesn't work in order to get there. And this can be very hard. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1942.48s)]
*  And I think we also push things too hard as a Western society in terms of development. Sometimes [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1947.6000000000001s)]
*  there's a, I like to tell my students about in England, that the glorious revolution is in 1688, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1953.68s)]
*  which is when we typically place them as having their representative revolution. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1959.76s)]
*  However, they adopt things like the test acts, which are preventing Catholics from matriculating [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1964.4s)]
*  at Oxford or from sitting in Parliament, you know, all the way up until, without, you know, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1969.2s)]
*  being Catholic, right? You know, all the way up until 1828, you know, is when these things are [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1975.28s)]
*  eliminated. And so when we try to, say, jump the card, you know, go too fast in a place and say, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1980.16s)]
*  well, you need to have women's rights now. You need to have, you know, you need to respect all [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1988.32s)]
*  these different groups in your society. In addition, you know, to adopting institutions of [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1993.2s)]
*  capitalism, these sorts of things, that's not the way it occurred, right? In places like England, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=1996.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, there was actually a lot of restraint, you know, and that doesn't mean we have to wait [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2001.6799999999998s)]
*  200 years or 150 years, right? You know, to move through these phases and other parts of the world. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2007.12s)]
*  But I think it's often realistic and destabilizing for us to think we can. I mean, the other thing [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2012.72s)]
*  to keep in mind is the amount of homogeneity that was present in a lot of these European states when [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2017.12s)]
*  they went through these transitions was very high. If you read, you know, about the United States, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2023.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, for example, Albion Seed, right? You know, you know, this was basically four different [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2028.8s)]
*  groups from England, you know, that came in and then were asked to eventually adopt, you know, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2033.6s)]
*  the U.S. Constitution as we have it today. And these were all white men who were Christian, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2038.9599999999998s)]
*  right? And furthermore, they were Protestant for the most part, right? You know, so this is [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2044.96s)]
*  an extremely homogenous group that we, and then they barely got it, right? You know, so if you [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2049.28s)]
*  look at the literature on voting at the Constitutional Convention, you know, one of my favorite footnotes [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2054.4s)]
*  in the academic literature is from a paper that looks at the economic and ideological factors [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2060.08s)]
*  that generate voting at the U.S. Constitutional Convention. And it claims that, you know, according [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2065.28s)]
*  to their model, if three or four more backcountry farmers from Virginia had showed up, you know, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2069.44s)]
*  it might not have worked, right? You know, so it was a fairly close run deal. And so I think we [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2073.76s)]
*  often have a lack of appreciation for the amount of homogeneity and the amount of time it took in [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2078.4s)]
*  order to get the political arrangements to take seed, right? You know, in modern, what we are, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2085.1200000000003s)]
*  the modern Western liberal democracies. To close out your part of this conversation, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2092.88s)]
*  are you game for a quick round of overrated versus underrated? Sure. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2097.44s)]
*  Okay. Number one, amateur astronomy, overrated or underrated? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2101.36s)]
*  It is underrated, but it depends on where you live. You know, so amateur astronomy is hard to do [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  in a place like Bethesda, Maryland, you know, which is where you live, which is where I live. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2112.88s)]
*  You have to drive a little bit if you want to see the stars, but you can still look at planets and [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2117.6000000000004s)]
*  the moon and things like this. And I think people don't look at them enough. I got into it for [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2121.44s)]
*  different reasons that I've stuck with it. You know, I, initially I got into it because I thought [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2124.96s)]
*  it was, you know, with science, you know, and I would read, you know, the foundation series [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2129.28s)]
*  by Isaac Asimov or things like this. And I was very interested, you know, in just learning about [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2134.0s)]
*  the stars. And it made me feel good about myself. But then over time, it really does give you [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2138.0s)]
*  appreciation for the scales involved, you know, with the universe and gives you a sense of, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2142.2400000000002s)]
*  a sense of proportion. I mean, what they say, the closest planet to us right now is Trappist [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2148.48s)]
*  one or something like that. It's 37 light years away. That means if we want to talk to them, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2153.1200000000003s)]
*  it's going to take 80 years, assuming we can. And so these are scales that I have a hard time [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2157.76s)]
*  appreciating, but I think everybody has a hard time appreciating, even if you sit under the sky [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2163.84s)]
*  occasionally and looking and look at these stars. So I, amateur astronomy is a dying hobby. You can [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2169.1200000000003s)]
*  tell that by going to a meeting, right? You know, of amateur astronomers, they tend to be males who [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2175.44s)]
*  are about 20 or 30 years older than I am, you know, at these. But nonetheless, I think it's [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2180.88s)]
*  something that if we could get the lights to be turned off, like they do in Switzerland [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2186.32s)]
*  at 11 o'clock at night, I think we would all benefit from that. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2190.2400000000002s)]
*  Max Weber, overrated or underrated? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2193.28s)]
*  Rated about right, perhaps overrated. You know, I think the, he has a lot of really good ideas [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2195.76s)]
*  and he had them very early on. I've used a lot of what he's written about. So rated about right, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2202.1600000000003s)]
*  Protestant ethic and spirit of capitalism had a lot of really good ideas in it, even if [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2207.76s)]
*  he might've been right for the wrong reason, right? You know, that Protestants built more [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2212.4s)]
*  schools probably, right? And it wasn't that there was this true ethical change. His concept of [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2216.48s)]
*  bureaucracy, right? It has been very useful for my thinking as well. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2220.96s)]
*  Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs and Steel. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2225.52s)]
*  Max Weber, overrated or underrated? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2228.0s)]
*  I think rated about right. He received a lot of attention for that book. I tried to [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2228.48s)]
*  switch in my teaching to using Yuval Noah Hari's book on sapiens and I found it wasn't a good [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2234.0s)]
*  substitute for Diamond. Diamond takes an approach which I think is, it's appealing [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2239.92s)]
*  and even if it might have flaws, I still think Diamond is one of the big, one of the best books [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2245.28s)]
*  out there describing the overall arc of geography and history over time. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2252.32s)]
*  Jared Last call, European Union, overrated or underrated? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2258.56s)]
*  Max Weber It is overrated for economics, underrated for politics, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2261.92s)]
*  in my opinion. So when the EU was first being generated, it was to my understanding for two [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2266.56s)]
*  reasons, right? To basically to keep the Germans in check and for steel policy. And I think they do [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2274.48s)]
*  a lot of bad things still for economics and I'm not sure the instabilities that are generated [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2280.4s)]
*  because the EU are not awesome very sometimes. And they also have generated a new source of rent [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2287.6s)]
*  seeking. So for example, if you're a French farmer and you want protection for your cheese, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2295.28s)]
*  you can go to the EU for it. You don't have to go to France. So that's not always a good thing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2300.88s)]
*  Politically though, I think there's still a great value to having an organization in Europe which is [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2305.44s)]
*  formally meeting from time to time and discussing these sorts of issues. And I don't see NATO doing [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2312.4s)]
*  that necessarily in the same way. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2319.1200000000003s)]
*  Noel Johnson, thank you very much. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2321.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2322.88s)]
*  And now we turn to Mark Koyama, also a colleague of mine. He's an economics professor at George [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2327.6800000000003s)]
*  Mason. I asked your co-author Noel this question. I'd like your take. It's often alleged by [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2333.04s)]
*  historians that as the Renaissance came about, capitalism was more prominent. Prejudice against [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2338.88s)]
*  Jews, other minorities went up when there was more capitalism. Is this true? And if so, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2344.88s)]
*  what was the mechanism? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2350.08s)]
*  It's an interesting question. So whether or not capitalism is really on the rise, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2351.36s)]
*  particularly in the early 18th century, is slightly hard to ascertain in my view. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2355.92s)]
*  Because I think eventually the 13th century, the commercial revolution 12th century, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2359.12s)]
*  is a high point of expansion of new cities being founded in northern Europe of Italian merchants [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2364.0s)]
*  going to the Middle East. There's the Crusades. But the Crusades initially kind of religious [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2370.08s)]
*  violence, you know, except a lot of religious violence and intolerance. But as the Crusaders [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2376.32s)]
*  come back to Europe, they're bringing with them knowledge of Arabic numerals. And it's actually [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2379.6800000000003s)]
*  quite, there's a cosmopolitan flavor to that period, to the high Middle Ages. And then you [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2384.88s)]
*  get the 14th century and the Black Death, which is a terrible economic collapse. But it's an [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2389.44s)]
*  economic collapse which changes the ratio between labor and land. And so incomes go up. Incomes go [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2394.32s)]
*  up and that gives rise to some of the changing kind of, that changes the nature of European [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2401.12s)]
*  economy in certain ways, which does favor the rise of art. Incomes are higher, people can afford [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2407.2799999999997s)]
*  luxuries. So maybe cities are to some extent growing. Whether or not the Renaissance is a [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2413.2799999999997s)]
*  period of dramatic economic change is I think, open to questioning. A lot of the merchant ventures [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2418.16s)]
*  and trading ventures are still controlled by charter companies or by the royal agents. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2427.04s)]
*  So I don't see it as a decisive break in the same way I see, say, the post 18th century or post 17th [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2433.04s)]
*  century industrial revolution period. I see that as a seismic change in the scale of economic activity. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2441.12s)]
*  The Renaissance is, it's not clear to me if it's qualitatively different from what went before. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2446.88s)]
*  So the separate question is why is violence and intolerance and religious violence going up? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2453.28s)]
*  And I see that in terms of more conventional and non-economic factors, the printing press, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2458.88s)]
*  the Reformation, those types and other shocks you see. That's what I see as being associated [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2465.6000000000004s)]
*  with this kind of greater intolerance in the Renaissance. So you think the best story we have [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2472.8s)]
*  about change is intolerance for this period. It's ultimately technology driven, printing press, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2477.84s)]
*  communications. Technology interacts with political institutions. So it's hard to say they're [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2484.0s)]
*  totally separate. But yes, there's a literature, historical literature about the formation of [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2488.4s)]
*  religious identities in this period. And it makes the point that people, the claimers, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2493.2000000000003s)]
*  John Bossy is one person associated with this, the Reformation Christianized Europe. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2500.7200000000003s)]
*  Because prior to the Reformation, people had looked at their local saints and they knew they [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2505.2s)]
*  were Christian in some background sense, but it wasn't at the forefront of their identity. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2509.8399999999997s)]
*  Whereas with the Reformation, it's like, I'm Catholic, you're Protestant. This becomes more [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2515.2s)]
*  salient. And that's partly due to technology, the printing press. If we take early modern Europe [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2519.68s)]
*  and we look at variations in the degree of toleration of minority groups, what's the most [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2525.8399999999997s)]
*  reliable piece of knowledge or understanding we have about the causes of that variation? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2530.8s)]
*  I'm going to try and explain it and hopefully it's not too complex away. There are two different [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2536.4s)]
*  types of kind of state or society in early modern Europe. And it's difficult. We have to like, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2541.92s)]
*  almost view them separately. So for example, Poland, Poland is sometimes celebrated by [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2546.5600000000004s)]
*  historians as a state without stakes, which is not exactly true. There are some people [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2551.44s)]
*  who are killed for religious beliefs in early 16th century Poland, but actually there are a [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2556.4s)]
*  lot of Protestants. Protestantism is spreading and there's no oppression of Protestantism. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2560.0s)]
*  And so it looks tolerant. Why is it tolerant? Well, it's tolerant because there's no strong [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2564.16s)]
*  central authority, the nobility, very powerful. So if you're, if a nobleman is sympathetic to [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2569.68s)]
*  Protestantism, he can protect it. There's no state capable of enforcing religious conformity. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2574.96s)]
*  So that's a reliable predictor, like a weak state, federalism, fragmentation is a reliable predictor [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2579.28s)]
*  of an absence of persecution. But what you see subsequently going forward is that's not a strong [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2586.4s)]
*  predictor of getting a liberal state later or enduring religious freedom. Whereas England and [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2592.1600000000003s)]
*  France are quite different. They see extreme religious violence in the mid 16th century as [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2598.32s)]
*  rulers attempt to maintain or restore religious conformity. But in most societies, once the tipping [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2603.76s)]
*  point is reached where it's seen as impossible, too costly to restore religious conformity, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2611.76s)]
*  then actually you've got to set about this task of building society where there will be religious [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2617.44s)]
*  differences and religious pluralism. This is 150, 200 year process. So England in the 16th century [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2621.84s)]
*  is nowhere close to being there, but it's on this road, which is going to lead to eventually say by [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2628.4s)]
*  the late 17th century, early 18th century. In British history, did the theoretical arguments [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2634.2400000000002s)]
*  for toleration even matter? So there are a number of famous debates about religious tolerance, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2639.92s)]
*  John Locke, Bale in France, or is this just a side show irrelevant? What's the power of ideas? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2644.88s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a great question. So there's no evidence that the more radical kind of [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2651.76s)]
*  arguments for for religious toleration. So this is associated with people like Sebastian Castello [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2658.32s)]
*  in the 16th century. There's no evidence they have much influence. There's no evidence of [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2663.52s)]
*  radical Anabaptists. The Anabaptists, again, they want separation of church and state, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2668.64s)]
*  and those ideas abhorrent to all right thinking people in 16th century England. So what gives [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2672.7999999999997s)]
*  rise to greater religious freedom? It doesn't seem to be the personality of rulers, for example, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2678.72s)]
*  their beliefs. So Elizabeth I in her private beliefs is we think, you know, she claims not to [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2683.7599999999998s)]
*  want to make windows into men's souls. So she seems quite eclectic and sympathetic to pluralism, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2690.64s)]
*  but her state is basically a police state, which kills up to 300 people basically for being Catholic [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2695.36s)]
*  in the 16th century. So why does it change? I don't think the intellectual debates are the [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2701.6s)]
*  forefront of what's going on. The political economy seems much more important. So Charles II [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2708.1600000000003s)]
*  doesn't again, he doesn't really care about persecuting non believers, but parliament in [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2714.88s)]
*  his period is a royalist parliament, then they're desperate to maintain the Church of England. So [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2719.28s)]
*  they're very cruel towards Quakers and so on. So yeah, I down with me and Noel together in our book, [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2724.0s)]
*  we don't think the intellectual ideas are meaningless. We don't think they play no role, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2730.0s)]
*  but they're always being mediated through the incentives of the actors who have political power. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2733.6000000000004s)]
*  I can see two possible sets of cases. One is I see a number of somewhat weaker states that may be [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2740.8s)]
*  persecuted more or they're less tolerant or they're maybe semi-fascistic. If you look at parts of [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2747.2000000000003s)]
*  Eastern Europe today, you might see that trend maybe in a modest form, but somewhat. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2752.64s)]
*  And then there's other cases, maybe like 17th century Japan, a relatively strong state for Asia, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2758.0s)]
*  East Asia, and it persecutes Christians a great deal in part because it is a strong state. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2764.24s)]
*  So if either weak states or strong states can persecute minorities more, what's the variable [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2769.6s)]
*  that determines which of those cases you get? Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah, so I actually [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2776.0s)]
*  think I don't really like, I need to maybe find the perfect terminology for this, but like the [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2781.6s)]
*  strong state is not, I guess, my favorite terminology. It's why I'm always prefacing this [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2786.64s)]
*  with something like a liberal state, a state which is like in some sense committed to liberal values. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2791.12s)]
*  The Japanese case is interesting. It's the most thorough suppression, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2796.08s)]
*  at least of Christianity, that I'm aware of historically. And it's done precisely because [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2799.92s)]
*  of the state has, whether it's a strong state is a difficult thing to measure, but it has [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2804.64s)]
*  sufficient coercive power relative to the minority in question. And once they seal off, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2811.28s)]
*  they pay a huge cost, by the way. So the main motivation for sealing off the borders of Japan [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2817.44s)]
*  is to stop Christianity seeping through. So this is a state which is willing to pay huge costs to [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2822.0800000000004s)]
*  do this. It's not a strong state in the sense of the Tokugawa Shogunate, actually any controlled [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2826.32s)]
*  part of the country, the independent Daimyo have a lot of power, but they're strong relative to [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2831.1200000000003s)]
*  the religion and the rulers seem committed. They see Christianity as such a threat, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2835.84s)]
*  they're committed to pay this tremendous cost of isolating the entire country from trying to do so. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2840.0s)]
*  And then obviously 20th century examples, you have the Soviet Union represses Christianity very [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2845.2000000000003s)]
*  comprehensively, and you have the Nazis as well. So obviously the power of the state is going to be [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2850.8s)]
*  necessary. You need a strong state to really completely suppress a religion. On the other hand, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2856.2400000000002s)]
*  as a precondition for enforcing liberal values or allowing liberalism to flourish, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2861.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm just not convinced that you have many examples of extremely weak states where this takes place, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2868.48s)]
*  because it seems to me that very weak states like, like say the Polish, Lithuanian, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2875.4399999999996s)]
*  Commonwealth are too easily captured by a few nobles or vested interests. And so the state in [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2879.12s)]
*  some sense becomes privatized. And the best you'll get is something like feudal, it's some kind of [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2885.7599999999998s)]
*  feudal, almost feudal arrangement. And that's not going to be, or historically at least, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2889.52s)]
*  it's not been a conducive environment for either markets actually to flourish in my view, or for [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2895.12s)]
*  human freedom more generally to flourish. If I take your book with Noel, and whatever it is [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2902.16s)]
*  you've added to our understanding of toleration, if you were to boil that marginal contribution [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2908.4s)]
*  down to a sentence, what would that sentence be? General rules, in some sense, that's perhaps a [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2913.68s)]
*  truism. So I'm going to have to break your, I'm going to have to like expand on one sentence. So [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2920.24s)]
*  perhaps many people would agree, we're not the first people to say that a rule of law, so general [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2925.2s)]
*  rules treating treating people equally before the law is like the sine qua of a state which allows [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2929.68s)]
*  kind of human individuals to flourish. And I call states like that liberal states. What we add to [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2936.56s)]
*  that is then the religious story. So that religion is at the heart of this rise of liberal states, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2942.48s)]
*  and it's at the heart of the rise of companies, the shift from identity rules to general rules. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2947.84s)]
*  Again, I'm going way over one sentence, I think. So that's the bottom line, what we add. I'd also [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2952.32s)]
*  say that we, another contribution we make is distinguishing between states where there's no [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2957.52s)]
*  persecution, or there's like de facto, there's some bunch of religions and people are not being [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2963.6s)]
*  learnt alive all the time. We didn't distinguish that from the idea of a liberal state, which is [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2969.04s)]
*  committed to pluralism, to plural, to free expression, free thought, and a multiplicity [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2973.36s)]
*  of religions. And what's the single best piece of evidence for that marginal claim? So I think we're [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2978.72s)]
*  contrasting the experience of like, so Europe or the West, even today, is not doesn't conform to our [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2985.36s)]
*  kind of ideals, liberal ideals, but there's something we can agree upon about modern liberal [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2994.7999999999997s)]
*  societies, which makes them very distinct from, say, other examples where people like historians [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=2999.8399999999997s)]
*  have argued there was so-called religious toleration, such as the Roman Empire, maybe, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3006.64s)]
*  or Spain under the Islamic Caliphate, which people claim to be a golden age of religious pluralism. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3011.44s)]
*  When you actually look at the details, it's quite different to what we see in modern liberal [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3018.48s)]
*  societies. And I think we're making the claim that political philosophers, social scientists [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3022.24s)]
*  who are interested in like liberalism or liberal societies haven't actually done a good job of [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3029.68s)]
*  engaging with the actual history of how these societies emerged. Sometimes argued that the West [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3034.16s)]
*  has less cousin marriage and thus is less clan-based and perhaps more free, more democratic, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3039.68s)]
*  more liberal. Agree or disagree? Broadly speaking, I agree. I think there's a distinction. The [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3044.9599999999996s)]
*  difficulty is unpackaging the, there's a package of goods which come together and [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3051.2s)]
*  prohibiting cousin marriage, which is this is something the Catholic Church was doing in the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3057.52s)]
*  high middle ages or early middle ages. That's part of this package, which seems to rise in Western [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3063.2s)]
*  Europe and seems to be associated with undermining kinship groups. That comparison really rests, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3069.04s)]
*  it's most persuasive when you compare the Middle East or Islamic societies with Europe. I'm not [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3076.08s)]
*  sure it's as persuasive if you want to explain the rise of Europe vis-a-vis the rise of the [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3080.16s)]
*  experience of say China or Japan. Why no less about the prevalence of cousin marriage, for example. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3085.7599999999998s)]
*  Your most frequently cited article is on the origins of anti-usury laws. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3091.92s)]
*  Why are there still so many anti-usury laws at the state level in America? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3096.56s)]
*  That's a good question. So my best answer to that is just going to be trying to explain why [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3100.96s)]
*  these laws were common. So why, so there's obviously a widely held moral intuition. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3106.56s)]
*  The initial cause I think is often a misunderstanding of why interest exists. So Aristotle [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3111.52s)]
*  believed interest was theft. People think that certain level of interest might be justified, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3117.84s)]
*  but there's some level can't be explained through underlying kind of economic fundamentals. And [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3122.72s)]
*  it's a misunderstanding of kind of the fact that we have different preferences, different [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3127.84s)]
*  attitudes towards intertemporal smoothing. And in some situations, the only way I'm going to be [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3132.16s)]
*  able to get a loan is if I'm willing to pay a high rate of interest. So there's an atavistic, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  very common antipathy towards these types. That said, I don't have a strong view about [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3142.8799999999997s)]
*  regulating them at some level. So the fact that we know that in general, these rules are bad, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3149.6s)]
*  doesn't mean that in some circumstances, like we might want to limit them. So for example, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3154.96s)]
*  one of the, you know, there's fair counts. You can write down a model where it makes sense [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3158.8s)]
*  under some circumstances if it's severe moral hazard or adverse selection, perhaps there's some [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3164.4s)]
*  justifiable reason for them. However, just to come back to my paper, I tend not to think that's the [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3168.48s)]
*  reason. So if you see these interest rates restrictions in European history, an economist [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  can come forward with an adverse selection or moral hazard story, which will justify the restriction. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3180.0s)]
*  But actually, if you look at the history, it doesn't seem to explain why Europe, for example, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3185.84s)]
*  banned all interest rates throughout most of the Middle Ages. That seems to be a combination of [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3191.04s)]
*  rent seeking by merchants who could evade these laws by rulers who might license some groups, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3195.52s)]
*  often Jews, to lend an interest and thereby collect monopoly rents from that practice. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3201.6800000000003s)]
*  Why was China as a nation or territory so large, so early in world history? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3207.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a great question. So there are several potential explanations, one of which is [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3213.84s)]
*  geographic. Another one would be there's also an argument from like the writing system. But I think [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3220.2400000000002s)]
*  the geography story is quite important. And Jared Diamond was at what Jared Diamond building on [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3225.92s)]
*  people like Eric Jones kind of argued that China's geography, and essentially, there's one, well, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3231.44s)]
*  there are two core geographic regions in China around the Yellow and Yangtze River deltas, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3236.96s)]
*  which produce a huge amount of like grain or rice. And so if you control those core regions, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3242.4s)]
*  you can raise large armies, you can have a large population and dominate the subsequent regions. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3248.96s)]
*  Whereas the argument is for Europe, these core regions are perhaps arguably more separated by [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3255.12s)]
*  geographical boundaries. The limitation of that argument on its own is that geography static. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3260.56s)]
*  So it doesn't really tell you anything about the timing. And China, the interesting thing [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3266.8s)]
*  about China, in my view, is not just that it was once unified or unified early, but it's [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3271.92s)]
*  persistently unified. It reunifies. And actually, interestingly enough, the periods between periods [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3276.8s)]
*  of de unification get consistently smaller. So they're always periods where it's fragmented, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3283.28s)]
*  like the warlord period in the early 20th century, but over time, they become smaller, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3289.52s)]
*  Europe doesn't seem to have that centrifugal force. So Europe, most of Europe is unified, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3293.28s)]
*  or a lot of Europe is unified by the Romans, but it's not able to come back together along those [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3299.44s)]
*  those lines later. And the argument that I put forward in an article of Tuan Huy Sing and [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3304.4s)]
*  Chiu Ko of National University of Singapore is that it's not just the core geographical reason, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3310.48s)]
*  that's part of it. But actually, the periodic threat from a nomadic step is another key [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3316.8s)]
*  factor. So this is geographic, because China has a very sharp slope from really productive [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3323.6s)]
*  agricultural land to land which is only fit for horses, the Eurasian steppe. So China could be [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3330.3199999999997s)]
*  invaded very easily from the north by the steppe nomads, whereas Europe, it was much less [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3335.92s)]
*  vulnerable to this. And that helps to explain why the Chinese state is often a northern state. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3341.04s)]
*  So just if I can add, if you think about China today, or even China in the past, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3346.24s)]
*  the really productive land, a lot of it's in the quite far south, near Shanghai, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3352.72s)]
*  Yangtze Delta, the political centre of China is near Beijing, or it's in the north. And that's [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3356.24s)]
*  due to this political economy threat from the steppe. And it's these periodic steppe invasions, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3361.52s)]
*  which we argue responsible for the centralisation and almost the militarised character of the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3366.08s)]
*  Chinese state through history. And would you be bullish on Chinese political unity today? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3371.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying you need to think everything in the country will go well, but just that it [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3377.44s)]
*  will hang together, not only bounce back, but stay more or less as a unified China. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3381.12s)]
*  I'm not really enough of an expert on China to have a strong view. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3385.7599999999998s)]
*  As anyone? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3388.7999999999997s)]
*  When I talk to Chinese, I was surprised relative to my prior that they're more separatist than I [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3390.56s)]
*  would have thought before I knew as much about the country. So people from the Shanghai region, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3398.64s)]
*  or people from Guangzhou and Hong Kong, they have more of a regional identity than you might expect. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3404.0s)]
*  And they feel that the Chinese state is quite dominated by northerners. So the most nationalistic [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3410.56s)]
*  pro-CCP Chinese often from the north. And it's there that the identity of the Chinese state [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3416.24s)]
*  and the Chinese people are really bound together, whereas for people on the periphery, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3421.84s)]
*  it seems less so. So I would not be... So put it this way, China has fragmented every couple of [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3425.7599999999998s)]
*  hundred years in its history. The most recent one, though, was fairly... It was still not that long [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3431.2s)]
*  ago. So I don't see it happening anytime soon, but in the wake of a disaster or some catastrophic [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3436.48s)]
*  collapse, you can imagine it happening. What you can put your money on is the Chinese state is going [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3442.88s)]
*  to be... It's unthinkable for them. That's why they're so keen on Taiwan becoming part of China [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3447.92s)]
*  again. Their ideology is based on one China. Why did China and Japan react so differently [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3452.96s)]
*  to the arrival of the West? So it's a great question. I think that there are many factors. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3458.8s)]
*  I'll describe the one I've looked at in some of my research with Tuanhui Singh and Chia Kimura [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3463.44s)]
*  Guchi. But I think there are several interesting features. So one is that Japan is... So we're [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3469.28s)]
*  going to focus on the size. So the size is very different. That's the stock. China's just fast. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3477.76s)]
*  And so even if the most developed parts of China, like Yangtze area, are urbanized and [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3482.4s)]
*  commercialized and are probably doing quite well until at least 1750, you have these peripheral [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3488.48s)]
*  regions which are facing very different climatic and economic conditions. China is transformed... [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3493.92s)]
*  Both China and Japan are basically insulated from Western threats until the mid-19th century. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3502.16s)]
*  Then they face them very... It's very stock. So it's very quick that you have the ability of [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3508.16s)]
*  Americans and British to sail steam ships into the harbor of Yokohama. But Japan, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3513.12s)]
*  it's very small and all of Japan is vulnerable. And so this is a geopolitical crisis of the [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3520.96s)]
*  highest order for Japan. China, they initially don't necessarily care about the British. They [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3526.4s)]
*  don't take them very seriously. It's huge. And once they do take them seriously, they have to face [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3533.52s)]
*  threats from both Russia. So the Russians are really pressing in on the Chinese in the 1850s. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3538.96s)]
*  And they've got these coastal threats from the British. And it's very difficult for this [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3543.6s)]
*  traditional Chinese state, which has emerged and developed to protect and dominate the steppe. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3547.28s)]
*  There's no Navy, for example. It's extremely difficult for that state to adapt to face the [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3553.6s)]
*  threat from Britain and France. Agility is kind of a term. We sometimes think about it with respect [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3558.32s)]
*  to states as well as individuals, but pre-modern states are not agile. They can't redeploy [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3564.64s)]
*  resources, reprioritize. And so the Chinese state really struggles to do this. Japan also struggles. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3570.64s)]
*  So Japan undergoes political crisis for 15 years from Peri's arrival in 1853, I believe it's when [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3576.48s)]
*  the Black ships first arrived, to 1868, which is the Meiji restoration. It's 15 years of total chaos. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3585.2799999999997s)]
*  And individual Japanese, kind of, daimyo and statelets, basically going to war with Westerners. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3592.08s)]
*  English ambassadors are being killed. But once they overthrow the shogunate and restore the [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3598.96s)]
*  emperor, they're able, partly, I think because it's a cohesive territory, to develop this [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3604.8s)]
*  modern state, which can respond to the West. That said, I don't think we have a total explanation [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3611.84s)]
*  for it. It's still a bit of a mystery that as successful as they were, there's a large part of [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3616.08s)]
*  that. We are squared of my explanation about the size and the political history is quite small, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3621.3599999999997s)]
*  I think. I think a large part of it is very difficult to explain. And one either has to make [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3627.8399999999997s)]
*  recourse to luck, to the amazing, some amazing abilities of specific statesmen, or to cultural [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3632.24s)]
*  factors, which are quite difficult. But Cortez was also luck with the Aztecs. To me, it's striking [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3639.04s)]
*  that you have the British in China, the Spaniards in Mexico, pulling off miraculous military [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3644.8s)]
*  maneuvers. And it seems there's some common element there, maybe lack of a conceptual scheme, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3650.64s)]
*  almost, for the victims. Yeah, they don't know how to interpret it. That's definitely true. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3655.2s)]
*  The Japanese are, so one piece of research, which, so the modern historiography, to the extent I'm [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3660.56s)]
*  kind of up to date with it, on the Japanese, downplay, it emphasizes that they're reading [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3667.44s)]
*  Western texts, the so-called Dutch learning. They're increasingly reading Western texts in [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3672.96s)]
*  the 19th century, and they're paying attention to what happened to China. So for example, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3677.04s)]
*  when the Opium War happens, the Japanese initially think that the British are just, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3681.12s)]
*  kind of like, you know, they could be swatted aside, and China would just destroy them. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3685.52s)]
*  And so they're shocked. And initially, the Chinese, initially, the chain court initially [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3689.52s)]
*  sends word to the Japanese that they've destroyed the British, and this is like, they're the victors. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3693.76s)]
*  And then the Japanese find out the real, what really happened, and that's a shock to them. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3699.04s)]
*  But they get that shock in the 1840s, and they can have 10 years or 20 years to adjust to the [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3703.6s)]
*  new realities. So maybe that gives them something of an edge. A final thing is the Chinese are a [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3708.96s)]
*  minority Manchu state. And so I think that really shapes their vulnerability. They're really worried [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3714.32s)]
*  about a Han uprising, and they have a typing rebellion to deal with. The Japanese are ethnically [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3719.92s)]
*  cohesive. Why was England such a coherent nation state so early? Some people say 13th century. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3724.4s)]
*  Yeah, Alan McFarlane is the origins of English individualism. They're certainly, so it's hard [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3730.8s)]
*  to know how far back it goes, to be quite honest, in my view. You can see nationalist sentiment in [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3737.76s)]
*  England, certainly from the 14th century. That's Chaucer. That's when the English elite start [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3742.7200000000003s)]
*  speaking English, the monarchy start speaking English, rather than French decisively. They stop [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3748.08s)]
*  speaking French effectively. So the Hundred Years Wars is important. Now the question is how much [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3752.96s)]
*  further it goes back before then. How much is the Anglo-Saxon experience crucial? And I would bow to [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3758.0s)]
*  experts on this, but certainly the Anglo-Saxon England seems to be a fairly cohesive state. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3764.56s)]
*  That's the state created out of Wessex in the late ninth and then the 10th century. Now I just don't [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3770.2400000000002s)]
*  know enough about how to believe. English Anglo-Saxon historians think of this as a very [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3776.48s)]
*  modern, as a very powerful state for its age. The Doomsday Book testifies to the bureaucratic [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3780.88s)]
*  capabilities of the Anglo-Saxon state, which the Normans then take over. So there is something there, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3786.7200000000003s)]
*  which is, yeah, I don't know quite what causes, what I should say is I don't know what the, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3792.4s)]
*  England ends up being this strong nation state. And so I don't know if it's just an artifact of that, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3799.84s)]
*  but we then look back and see the antecedents of the strong state in all this early medieval stuff. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3804.96s)]
*  Whereas it could be that Catalonia, you know, had Catalonia become a powerful state, we could find [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3810.16s)]
*  evidence of it in the early Middle Ages. So there's an element of survivorship bias, but I'm [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3814.48s)]
*  definitely always impressed by whatever I read about Anglo-Saxon England. What was the most [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3821.7599999999998s)]
*  undervalued factor behind the British Industrial Revolution? There's plenty of theories. You could [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3826.56s)]
*  cite 20 or 30 factors. Maybe they all play a role, but what's being neglected? Okay, so let's just [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3831.36s)]
*  think about the ones which are not neglected. So you have like natural resources, you have coal, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3836.72s)]
*  you have this idea of like high wage economy associated with Bob Allen, which now seems to [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3840.56s)]
*  be under pressure. You have stories about imperialism and trade. I think those are all, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3845.8399999999997s)]
*  people understand those. Perhaps, I mean, I don't know if it's underrated, but perhaps [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  this cohesive nation state story is part of it. One noticeable thing about the English Industrial [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3855.7599999999998s)]
*  Revolution is it doesn't occur in a political center. It occurs in the periphery in Manchester, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3861.9199999999996s)]
*  Yorkshire, Birmingham, Derbyshire. And so how many, if we look at like economic miracles or [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3866.64s)]
*  effervescences, I don't know how many of them arise in the capital region and the political center, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3875.12s)]
*  and how many arise in peripheral regions, maybe more than I think. But something about English, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3880.48s)]
*  the English society, if it allows a bunch of entrepreneurs to basically kickstart this [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3886.24s)]
*  revolution far away from like what's going on in London seems to be quite important to me. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3891.12s)]
*  And it takes many years of experimentation that these industrialists are self-funding many of [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3896.08s)]
*  their, many of these developments. They're not borrowing money from, so London has a sophisticated [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3901.36s)]
*  banking sector, but the London bankers are not financing the Industrial Revolution. They've [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3906.4s)]
*  been financed out of savings. And so it does take a long while to get going and it's being neglected. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3909.92s)]
*  Like not many people are talking about it in the 1750s, 1760s, 1770s. I mean, famously, Adam Smith [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3914.4s)]
*  doesn't really talk much about what's happening in terms of industrialization at the time he's [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3920.3199999999997s)]
*  writing. At least since Cromwell, England has been relatively tolerant toward the Jews compared to [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3925.28s)]
*  much of Europe. And if you're trying to build out a broader theory, compare some amount of English [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3931.36s)]
*  or British tolerance, but then compare that to how the Irish are treated or how the colonies or [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3937.28s)]
*  India is treated. Is there a unified approach that ties this all together or the British just [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3941.92s)]
*  schizophrenic in some way with respect to tolerance? I mean, I think that my quick answer would be, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3947.6000000000004s)]
*  it's because the rules in Britain are very different to rules outside Britain. So for example, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3952.16s)]
*  slavery, you couldn't have slavery in England, to the best of my knowledge, at least from the 16th [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3958.88s)]
*  century onwards. So slavery is a huge part of the British Empire and it's something which is done [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3965.12s)]
*  outside Britain, but it's not something which is practiced within the kingdom itself, even in the [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3971.68s)]
*  like, you know, 17th, 18th century. I don't know all the ins and outs of why that's the case, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3977.92s)]
*  but the Jews are invited in a favorable time. So there's a lot of antisemitism in English history, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3983.44s)]
*  Shakespeare, there's a crypto-Jewish doctor of Elizabeth the first who's hung drawn and courted [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3992.08s)]
*  or burnt alive, I can't remember which, in the 1590s. There's a lot of antisemitism, but the [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=3998.0s)]
*  Puritans and religious independents of whom Cromwell is basically the leader, they identify [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4002.96s)]
*  with Zion and Israel, they give their kids Israelite and Abrahamic and Old Testament names, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4009.04s)]
*  and the Jews who petition Cromwell to settle in England, Sephardic Jews from Amsterdam, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4015.12s)]
*  they have capital, they have money, they're allied in a war against Spain and the Spanish Empire, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4021.84s)]
*  and so it's a very politically opportune moment for them to come and they secure good terms. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4028.48s)]
*  And then subsequently, there's really not many problems with them, there's a little bit of, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4032.88s)]
*  there's some issues, there's some riots, but in general they're allies with the Protestant state. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4038.08s)]
*  They're small, they're a small community, so at least until the late 18th century, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4045.2000000000003s)]
*  there's not really much reason to be really hostile to them, unless you're like a [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4048.1600000000003s)]
*  Veron anti-Semite, whereas other cases it's a little bit different. So the Irish [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4053.2000000000003s)]
*  are coming in large numbers, they're Catholic and the Catholicism is seen as suspect because of the [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4058.2400000000002s)]
*  geopolitical consequences of it, so they're just less favored for those reasons. Similarly, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4064.56s)]
*  the British behavior in the colonies is very repressive often, but that's again, the [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4069.36s)]
*  schizophrenia is not within Britain, it's between what's inside and what's outside. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4074.2400000000002s)]
*  John McAllister Today, why have so many parts of Northern England declined so steeply, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4077.84s)]
*  compared to the industrial parts of Germany, parts of the Netherlands, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4082.88s)]
*  arguably France, it seems worse in Northern England. What's your account of that? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4087.12s)]
*  Nick Crafts So Nick Crafts has written some good stuff on this. So the only period when the South [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4091.52s)]
*  is not the center of English history is the Industrial Revolution. And the wealth of these [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4096.8s)]
*  industrial cities was remarkable in the late 19th century. And so, and I've been to a lot of these [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4101.04s)]
*  places and some of them better than others. So the ones which are big, like Manchester and Liverpool, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4106.64s)]
*  virtually, you know, they have cultural amenities, which mean that they're still [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4112.5599999999995s)]
*  flourishing parts of them. And if you revived a little bit in the last 20 years, I would say [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4116.16s)]
*  it's places like Doncaster and Barnsley, which were often like mining towns or one industry towns, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4120.08s)]
*  which have really fallen into into this disrepair. I don't know enough about the con I mean, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4126.719999999999s)]
*  Germany is Germany, I'm not surprised because German manufacturing has survived a much larger [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4132.639999999999s)]
*  extent than British manufacturing. I don't know if the comparison with France or America might be [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4137.28s)]
*  more salient, because you've got coal towns, for example, and I think coal towns in Pennsylvania, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4142.24s)]
*  or West Virginia have done very badly as well. So the German example would be would be manufacturing, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4148.4s)]
*  which has survived much more compared to say, these British towns, by the way, have been declining [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4155.12s)]
*  since World War Two. So Britain lost these are so called the industries of the first industrial [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4159.5199999999995s)]
*  revolution. They're driving Britain's progress in the 19th century. They've been in decline since [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4163.84s)]
*  the 1930s, 1920s. If you think of just take South England for now, the last maybe 30 years, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4168.4s)]
*  do you see that as a time of fundamental break, where South England has become a fundamentally [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4175.92s)]
*  multicultural society in a way that will never be reversed, and is unprecedented in English history, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4180.799999999999s)]
*  and that will just be swallowed? Or will that in some way be undone in Brexit is stage one and [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4187.28s)]
*  speculative? But what's your prediction? So my answer I have to just first off, like I did not [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4193.5199999999995s)]
*  predict that Brexit would happen. So and I'm someone who's from the south of England, and all [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4198.5599999999995s)]
*  the time I spent in the UK, most of it, with an exception of one year in York was in the south of [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4202.639999999999s)]
*  England. So this is a so I have a favorable and optimistic reading of that. And I think this [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4206.96s)]
*  the British society, at least what I observed of that, observe of that is actually fairly successful [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4214.08s)]
*  in integrating most migrants. So that everyone gets a vote on that, right? Yeah, including [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4219.92s)]
*  Northern England. Yeah. And my experience is obviously jars with like what you read or see [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4225.76s)]
*  about, you know, backlashes or antagonism towards European or non European migrants in the rest of [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4230.88s)]
*  the country. And so the question is, is it I don't see how it's reversible. So for example, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4235.92s)]
*  there are many, many e nationals currently residing in Britain. And I think Theresa May [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4241.4400000000005s)]
*  was pretty bad and not immediately granting them kind of basically permanently to stay. And there [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4246.64s)]
*  are many high skilled people leaving. But I think there's just too many of them. Like there's no way [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4252.160000000001s)]
*  these people are returning to their countries, they've made their lives in the UK. And so long [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4255.92s)]
*  as they're there, there's, you know, go go back to the England of the 1950s, which is like, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4260.0s)]
*  which is quite boring. At least anecdotally, you're up for a closing round of overrated versus [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4265.52s)]
*  underrated. Sure. Okay, number one, home team advantage in English football overrated or [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4271.04s)]
*  underrated. Now overrated. So it's saying it's very salient in the past, it's definitely gone down. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4277.04s)]
*  And if you if you look at like the best teams like Manchester City, they may be very well away from [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4282.16s)]
*  home. And why did it go down home? Well, I mean, this is this is very speculative. But my my [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4287.28s)]
*  hypothesis with Jimmy Reid was that in a so team sports, the team sports are different to individual [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4291.92s)]
*  sports. And home field advantage seems to be more prevalent in team sports. Now, probably the [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4297.92s)]
*  biggest reason home field advantage and it's still relevant is swaying the referee. So that's not [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4302.4s)]
*  something we talked about. So you influence a referee, that's a big deal, especially in like [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4307.52s)]
*  soccer, because there's a lot of this referee is a lot of discretion until very recently, there are [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4312.08s)]
*  no video replays. So discreet referee pressure is huge. The other factor we talked about is when [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4317.12s)]
*  team sports is a shirking problem. And so each individual player might have an incentive to have [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4322.96s)]
*  a margin shirk a little bit because they're in a team. And so if their teams go win to know anyway, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4329.04s)]
*  they'll under arrest a little bit. And so the argument is, is when you're following your team, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4333.76s)]
*  just by reading the scores in the newspaper, or maybe hearing it on the radio, I don't know who's [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4338.0s)]
*  I just know the team won to know I don't know the individual performances very well. So that might [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4343.4400000000005s)]
*  describe English soccer or football in the 1980s or 70s. The idea is now with every game being [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4347.52s)]
*  televised, and also not just that, to be honest, it's also the internet where you have every [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4353.76s)]
*  player's performance can be rated and they know with statistics now how many how many kilometers [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4358.8s)]
*  each player is running, then it's much harder for any individual player to shirk. And the idea was [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4363.68s)]
*  that the home the home fan base or audience or stadium that they can observe all the they get [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4369.120000000001s)]
*  much better information on each individual player's performance. Max Weber, overrated or [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4375.68s)]
*  under underrated? Why? Well, because most people just know the Protestant theory and they miss me [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4380.96s)]
*  miss reporter, whereas actually his most interesting stuff on like Chinese religion and like ancient [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4386.240000000001s)]
*  Judaism and just the role of history of music, right? Yeah, he wrote so much right? So yeah. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4391.84s)]
*  Could you pick a well known painter whom you regard as somewhat overrated? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4398.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, plenty. Money. Tell us why. Well, so it's hard to say. So I think for anyone who becomes [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4402.799999999999s)]
*  if you go to an art gallery, like an art gallery, you'll see people I mean, I see people always look [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4411.44s)]
*  at the paintings, but we also look at the name tag. And so there's always this tendency if it's like [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4417.28s)]
*  money, like, oh, it's money. So we go look at this one. Whereas actually, it might be the sizzling or [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4421.679999999999s)]
*  the manning of Pizarro, that might be the better painting sometimes. That said, this is a this goes [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4426.24s)]
*  back to something you like to talk about. It depends if you're judging the high points or the [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4432.24s)]
*  average, the high points of money are fantastic. And it's hard to overwrite them. But the average [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4436.8s)]
*  is not that special. The movie Schindler's List overrated or underrated? So I saw this recently, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4443.04s)]
*  we saw it recently. And it's been underrated. It's been it's been I mean, it deserved to be [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4450.08s)]
*  reissued. It's been it's an amazing piece of cinema. I think it's not a perfect piece. It's [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdkya9uzK38&t=4456.32s)]
