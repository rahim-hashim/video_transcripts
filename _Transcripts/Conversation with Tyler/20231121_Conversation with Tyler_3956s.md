Video Description: When Zeynep Tufekci penned a  New York Times op-ed (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html) at the onset of the pandemic challenging the prevailing public health guidance that ordinary people should not wear masks, she thought it was the end of her public writing career. Instead,  it helped provoke the CDC to reverse its guidance (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/business/media/how-zeynep-tufekci-keeps-getting-the-big-things-right.html) a few weeks later, and medical professionals privately thanked her for writing it. While relieved by the reception, she also saw it as a sign of a deeper dysfunction in the scientific establishment: why should she, a programmer and sociologist by training, have been the one to speak out rather than a credentialed expert? And yet realizing her outsider status and academic tenure allowed her to speak more freely than others, she continued writing and has become one of the leading public intellectuals covering the response to COVID-19.

Zeynep joined Tyler to discuss problems with the media and the scientific establishment, what made the lab-leak hypothesis unacceptable to talk about, how her background in sociology was key to getting so many things right about the pandemic, the pitfalls of academic contrarianism, what Max Weber understood about public health crises, the underrated aspects of Kemel Mustapha’s regime, how Game of Thrones interested her as a sociologist (until the final season), what Americans get wrong about Turkey, why internet-fueled movements like the Gezi protests fizzle out, whether Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise in Turkey, how she’d try to persuade a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic, whether public health authorities should ever lie for the greater good, why she thinks America is actually less racist than Europe, how her background as a programmer affects her work as a sociologist, the subject of her next book, and more.

*  visit conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=19.8s)]
*  Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of Conversations with Tyler. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=30.72s)]
*  Now I'm going to introduce Zainab, but actually I'm not completely sure [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=36.08s)]
*  of the fully correct pronunciation of her last name. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=40.8s)]
*  So Zainab, would you please say your name for us, correctly? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=43.6s)]
*  So I will, but I have to let you know there's no ground truth, so you can just make it up, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=46.72s)]
*  and there would be nobody who knew what it was supposed to be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=52.16s)]
*  So you could have gotten away with whatever you wanted it to be, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=54.96s)]
*  but it is Zainab Tufekci. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=58.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=60.96s)]
*  Zainab is starting as a professor at Columbia University in a new job. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=62.4s)]
*  She is the author of the renowned Twitter and Teargas, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=67.6s)]
*  The Power and Fragility of Network Protests, a highly influential book. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And over the course of the last two years, she has become one of the central American [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=76.0s)]
*  public intellectuals on the issue of COVID-19, having been right about virtually everything [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=81.12s)]
*  ahead of all the curves, correcting the public health authorities when they were wrong, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=87.28s)]
*  confirming them when they were right, and she knows many, many other things as well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=91.76s)]
*  Zainab, welcome to Conversations with Tyler. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=95.84s)]
*  Thank you for that very kind introduction. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=98.8s)]
*  My first question, now the lab leak debacle, that it became unacceptable in mass media [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=101.92s)]
*  to talk about the lab leak for a while. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=107.68s)]
*  How, at its most fundamental level, would you explain how we came to make that mistake? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=110.48s)]
*  I think two things happened, and one of them is the easiest one, because it's kind of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=116.56s)]
*  quite easy to see in other things too, which is that at the initial phase of the pandemic, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  with the Trump administration, to put it politely, bungling the response, and also occasionally [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  adding, you know, overt racism to its bungling, there was a great reaction, I think, to anything [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  they suggested that looked like they were just trying to deflect blame, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=142.8s)]
*  In fact, people have forgotten about it, but President Trump went through a period [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  during which he denied the pandemic was a big deal and praised China's president [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=150.96s)]
*  for a couple of months before it had exploded in the United States, but when it came to the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=156.08s)]
*  United States with its full exponential force, he switched to saying, well, it was China's fault, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=160.88000000000002s)]
*  and I think that created a big backlash among not just the scientists, but the public, because it [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  really did seem like just deflecting the blame in many ways, and plus, you know, the attendant [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=171.92s)]
*  racism and sort of calling the virus various racist names didn't help the situation. So that's, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  I think, the one that's most obvious. The second one, I think that's not as obvious to people, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=183.44s)]
*  is that the world of urology is not that big, and the Chinese lab in question, the Wuhan [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=189.6s)]
*  Institute of Urology and a couple of other labs in Wuhan, they're very much part of the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=198.72s)]
*  scientific establishment globally, right? I know there's been some speculations about the sort of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=203.92s)]
*  the whole bioweapons thing, and I just have never been very interested in that, because if you're [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=210.24s)]
*  going to do an actual bioweapon, a coronavirus is not your proper pathogen. The kind of scientists [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=215.04s)]
*  who work on coronaviruses are genuine normal scientists most of the time, and deeply, deeply [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=220.48s)]
*  embedded with the Western scientific establishment, especially since SARS, the other [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=225.92s)]
*  near miss we had in 2003, that didn't become a pandemic because of a lot of reasons had created [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=232.56s)]
*  a lot of interest. So you have this double whammy there, you were once there was the sort of the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=239.04s)]
*  Trump angle, but there was also this defensiveness around both the field, I think, because you're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  asking a field, I mean, I'm an academic, and if somebody came to me and said, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=253.68s)]
*  would you like to think about the fact that your field may have inadvertently perhaps, you know, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=257.68s)]
*  even in the mildest potential case, spark something that killed millions of people, of course, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=262.88s)]
*  defensiveness is very human in that, and people sometimes see, you know, China versus the US, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=268.32s)]
*  but as I said, in reality, the scientific establishment that we're talking about in [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=273.92s)]
*  this particular case is very, very much integrated with the Western scientific [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=279.2s)]
*  establishment, publishing in nature, science, sell those big things. So I think there was a sort of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=284.32s)]
*  desire to protect their colleagues, which once again, these are human. Plus, if a lab incident [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=290.32s)]
*  of some sort or a field incident of some sort could be implicated, that really would bring the push [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  for much more strict regulation on the kind of research we do. And I'm just talking about even [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  the more benign scenarios, right? You know, somebody screwed something up, they might not even [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=312.48s)]
*  known about it. Because for example, there have been a lot of calls for moving the high risk [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=316.32s)]
*  pathogen labs outside of cities, right outside of populated places. And when I floated that was a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=322.08s)]
*  couple of, you know, leading virologists, they were really aghast at the idea, they thought, well, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=328.4s)]
*  how are we going to hire people if you put us in the middle of nowhere, nobody wants to work [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=333.2s)]
*  there. And as an academic, you know, who also likes to choose where she works, I sympathize with [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=337.04s)]
*  that. But that's a big conflict of interest, the very field who has been quoted most in this is the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  most conflicted field, because they both have colleagues and a vested interest, the people you [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  don't hear from a lot are the biosafety people, who are actually the actual experts in this, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  you know, it's them we should have been speaking to, or people are kind of perhaps independent [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  in some ways, from all of this. And as the defensiveness grew, it became really hard, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=366.88s)]
*  from what I heard from a lot of people in the field, to say, if you thought it was like a viable [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=373.92s)]
*  thing, it should be investigated, you didn't even have to believe what had happened, because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  there's so much obfuscation, you don't really know what happened. Because the people who were allowed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=385.04s)]
*  were in relatively powerful and gatekeeping positions. So do you really want to sort of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=390.88s)]
*  in the middle of a pandemic, do you want to go to work on the pandemic stuff, and do your work [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=395.36s)]
*  and get future grants? Or do you want to like, raise your hand and say, yeah, my field needs [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=400.48s)]
*  more regulation, and perhaps some investigation into whether our research practices were implicated [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=406.40000000000003s)]
*  in something so horrendous, that's not going to make you very popular with your colleagues. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=413.36s)]
*  So I think that's how it was set up the turning point, probably not as visible to people outside, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  is the WHO investigation. You know, I wrote a New York Times article about the origins of COVID, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=425.36s)]
*  and I didn't really go into the WHO investigation. It is a debacle, it's going to go in history books [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=430.64s)]
*  into how bad it is. It is essentially, you know, just sort of typing up what the Chinese officials [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=436.32s)]
*  told them, almost uncritically. I mean, I realized they were limited in what they could do, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=442.48s)]
*  because in an origins investigation, you can't just do it if the Chinese government isn't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=448.8s)]
*  cooperating. But it wasn't that. That would have been an understandable limitation. The WHO [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=453.6s)]
*  report we got was almost like a PR exercise in how it phrased things, what it was certain about, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=459.68s)]
*  how it repeated assertions, what it didn't question. It didn't, it could have done things like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=468.32000000000005s)]
*  well, we've been told this, but we couldn't verify, or could have questioned a few things [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  in the report. But the final report written after the scientists had left the country, too, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=478.8s)]
*  in my view, was disgraceful, that it was allowed to go out like that, instead of saying, you know [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  what, we can really do a great investigation. Here's the limitations. And I think that really [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  got a lot of scientists who had been just kind of waiting and thinking this is not that big a deal, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  in terms of, you know, we've got the actual pandemic to worry about, to think, you know what, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=500.72s)]
*  if we do this, and let this be what's going to stand for science, it's just going to actually [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=505.2s)]
*  damage science, because letting that kind of report appear as the voice of science, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=512.96s)]
*  and if we do find something out, or as we do at the moment, we keep finding cover-up from the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=520.56s)]
*  Chinese side, which is not at all sort of reflected in what's going on in that report, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=526.0s)]
*  it makes science itself look bad. And that's how we got to the March letter in the journal [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=531.2s)]
*  science, the scientific journal science, where 18 very prominent people signed something saying, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=537.76s)]
*  you know what, we need an actual investigation, whatever it can do. The report was too certain, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=542.96s)]
*  and both hypotheses are viable. I would say the way they think about it would be that the existing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=549.2s)]
*  evidence base, such as it is, it's very limited, and full of contradictions and a huge cover-up, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=555.68s)]
*  is compatible with almost everything, like almost anything you can imagine the existing evidence [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=561.5999999999999s)]
*  base is compatible with. You can think what's more likely or less likely based on your own, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=567.04s)]
*  you know, personal preferences, but there's no evidence base to rule anything out almost. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=571.68s)]
*  And that, I think, got to be the turning point. If that's a fundamental mistake we made back then, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  what's the fundamental mistake we're making now? And what are the political [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=582.32s)]
*  economy roots of that mistake? So I think one fundamental mistake we're still making right now [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  is letting this be, you know, Republican versus Democrat, China versus not China thing, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=592.24s)]
*  instead of a fundamental problem of biosafety. It's a little bit like nuclear weapons and nuclear [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  physics and nuclear reactors. They can be really powerful and useful. They might be very crucial [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  for fighting climate change with the new kinds of energy we can use, but if you don't have it [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  as a safe thing, right, if you have questions about its safety, people are not going to want [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=617.2s)]
*  to use it. Countries are going to say, no, not in my backyard. And we see this, like I think Germany [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=622.96s)]
*  recently essentially stopped whatever it had, it's just not going to have any nuclear reactors. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=627.6s)]
*  That's partly because of Chernobyl. It scared the living lights out of people and for good reason. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think the fundamental mistake we're making it is not treating this like a biosafety crisis, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=638.8s)]
*  because we have one pandemic in 1977 that was indeed triggered because of a vaccine trial gone [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=644.56s)]
*  wrong. And that was essentially covered up at the time too. The scientists knew that it had to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=651.92s)]
*  involve something like a vaccine trial, but you've got almost no public discussion of it [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=658.56s)]
*  till 2008, almost 30 years later, partly because the scientists were thinking, you know what, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=664.0s)]
*  now it's not time to create a suspicion around vaccines or any of that. In 1977, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=668.96s)]
*  you're at the height of the smallpox campaign. And then we have this one, which is unclear. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  If we have one more incident of any kind, it's just going to be horrific, both for our research [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=682.24s)]
*  project and what we can do with it. So I think what ended up happening is that there's a few [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=689.12s)]
*  people who keep getting quoted in media, who are actually a small number of vocal people. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=694.08s)]
*  And there's a climate still where you can't have a sensible conversation. And that means that it's [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=699.84s)]
*  gotten Republicans versus Democrats or crazy scenarios versus a sensible oversight and [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=708.0s)]
*  investigation. And I don't think that's good because our medical technology is really powerful. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  It's got all these great things like look at our vaccines. And if you have a really powerful [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=723.6s)]
*  technology and a really powerful science, you have to figure out, does this power come with risks? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=728.72s)]
*  It's very similar to nuclear physics, I think, in that way. If you don't figure out the risks and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  downside, it's going to come bite you anyway, without you knowing it. So even if this one had [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=740.48s)]
*  nothing to do with the lab, it would have been a good time to say, just the fact that we can't be [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  sure should make us act and make sure that we never find ourselves in this position again. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=752.24s)]
*  Now, what can we do to make mainstream media less risk averse? So if you think back to last March, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=759.2800000000001s)]
*  Dr. Fauci, he's criticizing masks, right? He's even telling people it's fine to go ahead and [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=765.52s)]
*  take your cruise. So you're editor of the New York Times. Should you just come out and contradict [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=770.72s)]
*  the nation's leading public health authority when we're relying on that same person to correct some [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=776.16s)]
*  possibly larger mistakes of President Trump? What's the right role for the media in this? And how do [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=781.84s)]
*  we align their incentives in a superior way? Because we screwed it up. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=786.88s)]
*  This is a really difficult question because I ended up writing on our pads, essentially criticizing [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=791.36s)]
*  CDC and the WHO on masks in March 2020. At the time, people were still saying masks could [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=796.7199999999999s)]
*  infect you, make things worse. And never in a million years, I thought I'd start my own [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  personal pandemic criticizing global health authorities or the CDC. That was a really weird [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=811.28s)]
*  situation. And I have to say, I did not like it one bit. I knew they were wrong around early March. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=817.04s)]
*  I have links to Hong Kong. I was researching the field. There's a lot of infectious disease [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=823.36s)]
*  specialists in Southeast Asia. They're way ahead of us, partly because they've been through SARS [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=828.7199999999999s)]
*  and partly because they really are way ahead of us. And I started tweeting out the argument on why [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  they were wrong, just on the science side of the virus, sociology side of masks, all of that. And [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=839.28s)]
*  I just sort of twiddled my thumbs after tweeting out the whole argument, hoping somebody would write [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=845.84s)]
*  it and not me, because it shouldn't be like, I mean, it's kind of really terrible to undermine, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=853.12s)]
*  as you say, nations leading health authorities. So I hoped it would come from, I don't know, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=859.52s)]
*  the ex-director of CDC, somebody like that, somebody with really high stature. So it didn't [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=865.6800000000001s)]
*  look like a random challenger, because how are you going to distinguish that from an anti-vaxxer or [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=870.8s)]
*  a quack, right? That is a real problem, but it didn't happen. So I think the real question you're [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=877.76s)]
*  asking isn't what should the New York Times have done? In some sense, I think what should our [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  scientific establishment have done? Why didn't they create a consortium? Why didn't the universities [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=889.04s)]
*  create their own advisory body or some sort of, like, even if our own authorities weren't [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=896.72s)]
*  functioning very well, partly because of Trump's not great, I mean, really negative influence, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  we didn't like step up as academics to say, here's another consortium of lots of experts, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=908.48s)]
*  not just one person saying, oh, by the way, because that's really corrosive at some point to have [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=917.36s)]
*  individuals be ahead of the health authorities. Isn't the scientific establishment part of the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=923.52s)]
*  problem? So there's a kind of religion of purity, the cult of the randomized control trial, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=930.16s)]
*  you want to maximize status, everything has to be perfectly safe, when in fact, during a crisis, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=935.76s)]
*  we want them thinking in terms of expected value and expected number of lives saved. So what can [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=941.28s)]
*  we do to reform them to get them to think more in terms of expected value? Because they failed us [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=946.64s)]
*  most of all. So I would say that there are many things for which you do the randomized trials for [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=952.08s)]
*  good reason. What we didn't get was the flexibility necessary to match the question to the method. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=958.88s)]
*  With something like masking up, the precautionary principle plus the mechanistic science plus the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=967.0400000000001s)]
*  South Asian experience, to me was more than clear where things were. With other things like vaccines, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=973.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm on the side that there would have been problems with and we can discuss this with [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  things like human challenge trials for a bunch of complicated reasons. So what you needed [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  was flexibility in what's the right method, given the risk you're taking. For masks, I think it was [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=991.0400000000001s)]
*  clear. Even if you reject human challenge trials, so the vaccine information is presented, and then [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=999.36s)]
*  it's three weeks to schedule a meeting at the FDA and have a final decision. The offices are locked [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1005.36s)]
*  and called over a four-day Thanksgiving weekend. I asked many people who are experts in the area, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1012.16s)]
*  they all assured me it could be done in less time than three weeks. And yet it took three weeks, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  because what is it? Just takes that long to schedule the meeting or there's too much status [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1022.88s)]
*  maximization? How do we fix that problem, which seemed to recur in many different stages? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know the details of that particular one, but with something like vaccines, the reason I'm [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1033.36s)]
*  cautious is that, once again, there's a saying, it's not vaccines, but vaccination that saves lives. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1039.6s)]
*  So the slightest screw-up in vaccines can undermine confidence and just kind of, even if [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1045.6799999999998s)]
*  they're approved and they're scientifically kind of solid, if you overlook something or if there's [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1052.4799999999998s)]
*  some unexpected thing, that can be dramatic and terrible. So I'll give you an example that I can't [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1058.08s)]
*  figure out right now, which is that why haven't we gotten the full authorization? Right now, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1062.8s)]
*  they're still functioning as EUA and that is both causing people to think it's experimental because [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1068.0s)]
*  it's still emergency and it is sort of holding back some of the necessary things like mandates, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1075.12s)]
*  because which employer is supposed to say, okay, it's an emergency thing and it's not fully approved, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1080.8799999999999s)]
*  but I'm forcing you to do it. That doesn't seem to make sense. And I'm just looking at it and [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  thinking, you know, we've vaccinated in this country, you know, more than a hundred million [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1090.96s)]
*  people. We've vaccinated, you know, a billion around the world. We have a very good idea [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1095.1200000000001s)]
*  of the safety profile and it's better than most vaccines that are approved. So why are we waiting [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1100.4s)]
*  for the full approval? And I have no answer to that one. Like, well, sometimes I try to do the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1106.96s)]
*  most charitable reading, maybe they, with the approval, the initial emergency one, they, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1111.92s)]
*  you know, maybe it could have been 10 days instead of three weeks, maybe a week difference. I don't [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1118.64s)]
*  really know. I don't have like background information, but I'm just looking at the full [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1123.44s)]
*  approval and I don't understand. I think there's something that Trump's presence has obscured, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1128.5600000000002s)]
*  which is there's a malaise in the Western scientific public health, economic governing [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1138.72s)]
*  our institutions. There's something not functioning very well, but because we are fairly [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1146.56s)]
*  wealthy nations with an enormous amount of inheritance, we can get by. We have a lot of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1152.8s)]
*  science. We have a lot of scientists. We have excellent universities, you know, we have so a [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1158.72s)]
*  lot, but I feel like we're almost like the second generation or even the third generation that's [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1164.0s)]
*  still spending the inheritance. And since we started so rich, it's kind of hiding the deeper [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1169.28s)]
*  problems and Trump's year made it look like it was all Trump. But I'm looking at Western Europe [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1175.76s)]
*  and I'm like, well, they didn't do that great either. They in fact, they've done terrible, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1181.68s)]
*  relatively speaking. So I feel like we haven't really gotten our heads wrapped around how we do [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1186.4s)]
*  risk assessment, how we move, as you say, fast when we need to move fast, especially for things [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1192.32s)]
*  like masks, for which downsides are very little. You know, if you found out they were useless, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1197.84s)]
*  you can change it next month and you didn't lose anything. We don't do it. Like there's something [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1201.84s)]
*  we haven't really completely come to grips with. And the pandemic's urgency is perhaps [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1207.6799999999998s)]
*  acted like a stress test. It's shown us the problems, but it's still ongoing. So we haven't [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  sat down and said, let's think about it because this is not good. And I think that's job number [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1220.24s)]
*  one. Like after the pandemic gets kind of calmer, which will happen pretty soon, it's going so fast [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1226.24s)]
*  that it's going to end relatively soon. We should sit down and say, this wasn't just Trump. We [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1232.0s)]
*  screwed up a lot of things and we also have revealed a lot of cracks in our institutions and it's time [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1238.8s)]
*  to try to fix that. If I look at some of the other people who got many key questions right early, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1244.16s)]
*  Nate Silver, Alex Tabarrok, they tend to have a background in expected value thinking and in [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1249.84s)]
*  statistical thinking. You're a sociologist. How does your background in sociology inform [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1255.12s)]
*  your having been right about most or all things COVID? I mean, for one thing, the sociology of [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1260.96s)]
*  the situation is always very important. For example, one of the reasons that they were saying you [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1266.6399999999999s)]
*  don't need to wear a mask early on where they were saying something like, well, you should only wear [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1272.48s)]
*  a mask if you're sick. And like you don't need to a sociology degree to understand stigma, right? If [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1276.32s)]
*  you have a deadly pandemic with an unknown disease, there's no way you're going to go out [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1283.6s)]
*  wearing a mask if only sick people are wearing masks. I mean, you don't really, if they had [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1289.12s)]
*  anybody with any social science background or any common sense in that room, they'd say, wait a [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  minute, how are sick people supposed to wear masks? Like that is just not humanly feasible for them to [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  paint a target on themselves like that. So that's one of the ways that it helps. The other way it [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1303.6799999999998s)]
*  helps is that. So I used to teach things like groupthink and institutional inertia and all [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1309.6s)]
*  those things that we've seen. And I, you know, in some ways, one of my friends who's an immunologist [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  and a medical doctor at Harvard, Michael Mina, who's done a lot of work on rapid tests. One of [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1323.9199999999998s)]
*  the things he keeps joking about is how basic our virus is. Like the virus that has caused our [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1329.04s)]
*  pandemic is a coronavirus. And if you had a, it starts to essentially with a minor twist, like [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1335.36s)]
*  there's not much we need to figure out about it. Yes, of course, you know, think figuring out things [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1341.9199999999998s)]
*  like vaccines is important, but in terms of its basics, it's not a retrovirus like HIV, which [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1347.36s)]
*  forced us to write the textbook, right? So the virology part of it wasn't very complicated in [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1353.6799999999998s)]
*  some ways to, you know, a competent virologist or something, you know, Michael jokes like, you know, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1359.28s)]
*  it's just first year student can handle most of it. It's a very simple, straightforward virus. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1364.4s)]
*  But the things like the groupthink in parts of the scientific establishment, which, or, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1370.24s)]
*  or the silencing, right after I wrote about masks in March, 2020, I honestly, I thought that's it, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1378.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm going to get canceled. That's the end of my public writing career. I just contradicted the CTC [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  and the WHO at the beginning of a pandemic. I don't have a medical degree whatsoever. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1391.2s)]
*  I just thought I have to do it. I'm a tenured academic. If I'm not going to do this now, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1396.64s)]
*  like what is the point of tenure if I'm not going to take this risk? So I thought here, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1400.64s)]
*  I did my job. Now I'm going to get canceled. Well, instead, what I got was a lot of emails from [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1404.8s)]
*  people in the medical professions thanking me, saying, thank you for writing it. And I, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1411.04s)]
*  like, I thought, you know, you're welcome. But, you know, part of me was thinking, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1416.48s)]
*  why did you guys write this? Like, don't thank me. Like, I would like to have somebody with more [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1420.4s)]
*  credibility to have written this. And what I realized was they were just either silent or [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1426.48s)]
*  parts of them had convinced themselves of really illogical things like a mask might be harmful. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1433.28s)]
*  I just can't like, there's no logic to it. There's nothing. It's just groupthink. So the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1440.08s)]
*  sociology of the moment made me realize after that incident, I thought, you know what, sometimes [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1444.24s)]
*  being an outsider and not having my grants or my feelings or my professional career or my friendships [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1450.4s)]
*  be affected by this gives me freedom to front things. Like, I know what the scientific sort of [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1459.1200000000001s)]
*  underground is speaking about. And I have, like, I don't have a medical degree, but I can read a [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1466.88s)]
*  good deal of the papers just at a basic level. And I know statistics and I can read some of the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1471.68s)]
*  basics. And I have a lot of friends in the, you know, especially sort of junior people who are, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1477.44s)]
*  some of them are a gas but cannot speak up. And because I don't have as much to lose, I can write [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  things in a way that sometimes they can. And that's really made me think, like, we need a [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1491.04s)]
*  mechanism for that to be possible for the scientists in the field. Medical fields are very [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1496.88s)]
*  hierarchical. And there's some positives to that. You don't want quackery there. But when they need [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1504.0s)]
*  to be challenged, there's no mechanism to challenge them. So we can have a better sense of how you [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1508.8000000000002s)]
*  think. Talk us through a mistake you once made in reasoning and how that happened. You should. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1513.92s)]
*  Bad trades, so to speak. Yeah, I know. Like, this is the, this is the job interview question where [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1519.68s)]
*  you say, I work too hard and I'm a perfectionist. You know, it's just very, very hard. In the [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1524.72s)]
*  pandemic, or are you asking general? No, anything, anything in all of life, a mistake you made [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1533.76s)]
*  in practical reasoning and how it happened. Oh, my goodness, I made so many mistakes. Now I'm [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1539.28s)]
*  wondering, like, what I should reveal given this is going to be a podcast, because the list is [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1543.84s)]
*  quite long. So let me try to find a useful example that I can share. I don't know what I would call [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1548.88s)]
*  like a mistake, but I have learned a lot more over the years about that line where you kind of know [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1556.72s)]
*  enough about something to try to reason what you should be thinking about that. I mean, it's gotten [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1566.0800000000002s)]
*  better. I'm not saying at all done there, but I have the same academic disease that any academic [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1571.7600000000002s)]
*  will understand that I sort of try to get, you know, I get focused on the interesting, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1577.36s)]
*  because that's appealing to me. And most of the time, most answers are boring. You know, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  it's a respiratory disease, wear a mask, right? That's kind of a boring example. You know, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1591.04s)]
*  trying to be too clever, too smart, almost too contrarian sometimes. So I would say that is [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1596.1599999999999s)]
*  something that I fight in myself, because like a lot of academics and a lot of intellectual people, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1602.0s)]
*  I like the answers that surprise me. And I like sort of examples that appear counterintuitive. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1607.36s)]
*  But in reality, they're almost never true. Like there are very few things in the world that I [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1615.6799999999998s)]
*  think that are big and important where the counterintuitive and the surprising things [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1621.84s)]
*  actually really revealing. So that's my like reasoning sort of not error as much as much as [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1625.6799999999998s)]
*  attraction that I believe I have gotten a better handle on. In fact, like what I've done throughout [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1632.32s)]
*  the pandemic and what sort of some of the people you've named is just say a lot of basic stuff, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1639.12s)]
*  just, you know, respiratory disease, you need masks, vaccination, you need wider coverage as [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1645.28s)]
*  soon as possible. Outdoors is safer, you know, those kind of very simple things. If you're having [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1651.12s)]
*  super spreading events at a distance, it's probably airborne. So every time I do that, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1657.28s)]
*  I do better. Let me try an example where I disagree with you and see if we can work that out. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1662.24s)]
*  So you've been very critical of stock buybacks. From my point of view, they're just like stock [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1667.76s)]
*  dividends. They don't matter. They don't harm the economy any more than paying interest on bonds [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1672.3999999999999s)]
*  harms the economy. It just recycles funds. There's not a real resource cost. They hardly increase the [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1677.44s)]
*  value of stocks, right? The academic literature essentially would agree they're not a big deal. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1683.12s)]
*  So why be upset about stock buybacks? Have I like said something about stock buybacks? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1688.4799999999998s)]
*  Your Atlantic tease on the GameStop mess. Quote, for example, major. I might have said that. Okay, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1697.6799999999998s)]
*  all right. What did I exactly say? Probably was something specific. Let me find out what I got [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1705.36s)]
*  wrong. I'm waiting to hear. Quote, major US airlines have spent nearly all its extra cash [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1710.48s)]
*  on stock buybacks for the past decade, thereby inflating its stock price and thus executive pay, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1716.24s)]
*  which is often tied to the stock price and the stock market. And again, stock buybacks, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1722.08s)]
*  they're a modest signaling value how much the firm is worth. So I have said that I honestly, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1726.4s)]
*  I'm going to consider right away that I don't have a huge opinion on stock buybacks in general. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1735.84s)]
*  That sentence was in the context of they get dues to stock buybacks with their extra cash, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1740.8s)]
*  and then they get bailed out with taxpayer money. And that's my criticism is that I don't think [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  these companies should be whenever they get in trouble, they get bailed out. And I'm not against, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1752.8s)]
*  you know, occasional bailouts. But I think it's extra problematic when you have the executive pay [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1758.1599999999999s)]
*  be that high. And then, you know, at the first sign of stress, they're like taxpayers bail us out. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1764.56s)]
*  I don't think it's healthy for the economy or the competition either. And that's the extent of my [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1770.64s)]
*  opinion on stock buybacks before I get in more trouble on this. What's your current view on how [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1775.52s)]
*  much YouTube radicalizes people? So it seemed that way for like a year under Trump. Now they've [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1781.84s)]
*  changed the algorithm, the government we have, like it or not, it seems pretty boring, right? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1787.04s)]
*  Mayor of New York, mainstream candidate, radical left didn't do that well. Isn't that over? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1792.24s)]
*  So I don't actually think I know I don't think so. And I don't think the what I call the [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1797.1200000000001s)]
*  radicalization, there might be a bit of a misunderstanding in that it's not like about [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1801.76s)]
*  Trump. In fact, even my first article about it, it is what's the right word for it is been a bit [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1806.24s)]
*  difficult, because we sometimes say extremism, but that's not the right word either. It's pulling [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1812.32s)]
*  you to the edges, because it goes back to my own reasoning, temptation, the edges are more exciting. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1816.64s)]
*  So it's not necessarily pulling you to Trump, it's not necessarily pulling you to this or that is [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1823.68s)]
*  pulling you away from boring. And what is not boring is exciting to watch, right? Who the heck [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1828.8000000000002s)]
*  wants to watch a movie of, you know, functioning bureaucracies and institutions, but I mean, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1834.96s)]
*  it would be great in a pandemic, but it wouldn't make a good movie. So if you want to watch [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1841.2s)]
*  something, what you watch is the thing that's kind of exciting. It's the 10 biggest sinkholes in [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1846.24s)]
*  Florida and watch the alligator almost eat the baby. So what you're getting is pulled to the edge. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1852.64s)]
*  And that's true for politics. That's true for anything you want. But it keeps on showing me [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1859.04s)]
*  chess videos, maybe the Sicilian defense pops up. But there is an alternate literature Munger and [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1864.48s)]
*  Phillips, Ledwitch and Zaitsev, both have written papers in the last three years saying no evidence [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1870.4s)]
*  that YouTube radicalizes. Maybe that's agnostic. But when I read you on lab leak, it's all about [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1875.76s)]
*  agnosticism, expected value, wisdom, multiple perspectives. But when I read you on social [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1881.2800000000002s)]
*  media, YouTube, it seems very hardcore. Here's the right answer. It's bad for people. It radicalizes [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1886.64s)]
*  them. It's all about the ads. It's like there's two Zane apps. And why not apply the lab approach [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1892.5600000000002s)]
*  to social media? Well, okay, so here's the thing that I'm going to push back a little bit, because [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1899.04s)]
*  my book is all about how great social media is in some sense for dissidents as well. But it's not [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1903.68s)]
*  an unalloyed good. It's complicated. I'm from Turkey, like it would be kind of hard for me to deny [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1909.44s)]
*  that, you know, Facebook is now kind of the public sphere there and Twitter, like that's where you [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1916.32s)]
*  break a lot of the censorship thing. So I'm acutely aware of a lot of those things. But [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1921.84s)]
*  in terms of the algorithm pulling you to the edges, I do think it's still true. It doesn't really [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1927.6s)]
*  mean like it's pulling you to sort of only one side. That's the misunderstanding. It's like one of [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1932.96s)]
*  the few pages that does really great on Facebook. On the left is something called Occupy Democrats. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1938.08s)]
*  And I mean, it's just nonstop outrage and barely tied to truth. So it's not just the right wing [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1945.12s)]
*  thing. But I mean, the fact that it is very friendly to authoritarians for some reason, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1954.08s)]
*  but the fact that it was more right in the United States is more about the United States' [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1959.52s)]
*  political structure. And my criticism isn't that it's great for us to have these large platforms [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1964.8799999999999s)]
*  in some sense, and greatly expanded speech. But the way they keep people on the site by keeping [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1972.96s)]
*  them interested is a bit like keeping people in a cafeteria by giving them constant chips and [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1981.28s)]
*  ice cream. I like chips. I like ice cream, but I wouldn't want a cafeteria whose business model [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1988.6399999999999s)]
*  is to keep me sitting in that table as long as possible. Because we know this, like we know [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=1995.04s)]
*  in cities where people, there's the infrastructure for walking, people walk. When you sort of change [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2002.96s)]
*  the menu in cafeterias, people eat different things. When you put stuff in different places, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2009.36s)]
*  people watch different things. And I think the papers that you cite, one of the problems here [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2015.84s)]
*  is it's a little bit like China in that we have no data. Like the YouTube stuff that we have [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2022.0s)]
*  tried to do, I mean, we're literally looking at very, very, very broad data, because what we need [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2028.3999999999999s)]
*  is YouTube's internal data, perhaps linked to a panel, something like think like not the GSS, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2035.52s)]
*  but something like a couple thousand people panel that is linked to sort of data. And it's like [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2042.8799999999999s)]
*  20 years into the sort of internet explosion, and we don't have a single good study. Most of the data [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2049.36s)]
*  is locked up in the companies, and there's not a good research thing. So I'm agnostic in the sense [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2054.72s)]
*  that I don't really know exactly the extent to which the algorithm works. But that's similar to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2060.32s)]
*  lab leak where I don't know what to say because whatever data there is, it's in China, we don't [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2065.6000000000004s)]
*  have access to it. Now, in all of these dialogues, there's a middle segment called underrated versus [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2071.84s)]
*  overrated. I toss out some names ideas. You tell me if you think they're underrated or overrated. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2076.88s)]
*  The Turkish singer, I'm going to go orthogonal. The Turkish singer overrated or underrated. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2081.84s)]
*  When which country? It's difficult. I mean, I know him. I would say he's just about right, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2088.8s)]
*  because he's kind of past his peak. Sorry, Max Weber overrated or underrated as a sociologist [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2097.6800000000003s)]
*  underrated, underrated. I mean, the reason part of the reason he's underrated is, is that because he [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2107.6000000000004s)]
*  writes in that very hard to read, you know, early 19th century writing. But if you read Max Weber, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2113.84s)]
*  90% of what you want to understand about the current public health crisis is there in his [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2120.56s)]
*  sociology of I mean, not just him, but sociology of organizations, sort of how that works. Good at [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2126.88s)]
*  that. Yes, I would say underrated, probably because it's very hard to read. And what we don't do is, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  yeah, it's like Shakespeare, you need the modern English version, conceptually, for more people to [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2140.88s)]
*  read it. I would say almost all of sociology is underrated and how useful how dramatically useful [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2147.84s)]
*  it is just asked me anytime like early on, like I knew we were going to have a pandemic, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2155.44s)]
*  completely based on sociology of the moment in early January, like before I knew anything about [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2160.1600000000003s)]
*  the virus, because nobody they weren't telling us, but you could just use sociological concepts to [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2165.44s)]
*  put things together. And Max Weber is great at most of them and underrated. Come on, Mustafa [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2169.84s)]
*  overrated or underrated? Underrated. Why? Why? Because my grandmother, she was 12 or 13. When [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2176.32s)]
*  she was in sort of Mediterranean region, Central Asia, about Mediterranean region, very close to [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2187.6000000000004s)]
*  the Mediterranean. She was born the year the Turkish Republic had been founded. And so 1923, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2192.32s)]
*  and she was like 13 or so she would just about to get, you know, be married off. But the Republic [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2200.0800000000004s)]
*  was just a little over a decade, like same age as her. And they created national exam to pick [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2205.84s)]
*  talented girls like her. And the ones that won the exam got taken to Istanbul, to the sort of elite, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2214.24s)]
*  one of the very few boarding schools, high schools for girls. Now the underrated part isn't just that [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2223.2s)]
*  such a mechanism exists that the underrated part is that the country changed so much in 13 years, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2230.08s)]
*  that her teacher was able to prevail upon the family to let her go. I mean, to have a 13 year [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2237.7599999999998s)]
*  old be sent off to Istanbul, you know, complete opposite side of the country to a boarding school [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  for education, that kind of sort of flourishing of liberation. I'm not going to sort of deny [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2251.8399999999997s)]
*  it was an authoritarian period and minorities like hers during that period were brutally [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2259.7599999999998s)]
*  suppressed. So I can't like make it sound like there was nothing else going on. But in terms of [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2265.28s)]
*  creating a republic out of the ashes of a crumbling empire, I think it's one of the very striking [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2270.8s)]
*  stories of national transformation globally and in within one generation's underrated. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2278.88s)]
*  TV show Game of Thrones. Why does it interest you as a sociologist? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2287.2000000000003s)]
*  So it interested me until the last season and a half, because before that, it was a very, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2291.92s)]
*  very sociological thing. So here's the thing. Here's the difference between a sociological story [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2298.6400000000003s)]
*  and a psychological story. In a sociological story, you can imagine yourself being almost anyone, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2303.1200000000003s)]
*  right? Instead of like terrible evil characters and good people where you just identify with the [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2309.0400000000004s)]
*  good ones, which is the classic Hollywood sort of narrative, which is also most of human narrative, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2313.84s)]
*  right? You have the good one, the bad one. It's more like a complicated mythology where you can [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2319.36s)]
*  imagine yourself being any one of those characters, even the ones that do the terrible things. You can [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2324.1600000000003s)]
*  kind of see yourself doing it. And the second sign of a sociological story for me is when nobody has [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2328.96s)]
*  plot armor, because it's the setting that's carrying the story with lots of people, but it [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2334.88s)]
*  doesn't rely on one person dying or not dying. So for four or six seasons, you have a very sort of [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2340.48s)]
*  institution, sociology, very interesting. It's like the wire. People can die, but the story's [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2346.8s)]
*  still gripping because it's sociological. And here comes season, whichever the last season is, and all [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2351.92s)]
*  of a sudden, Arya can walk through fiery dragons and nothing happens. It just misses her by an inch. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2357.44s)]
*  And I'm like, all right, you lost the plot here, because plot armor essentially means you no longer [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2364.6400000000003s)]
*  have a solid sociological story. So I watched it with great interest until the end. And in the end, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2371.28s)]
*  I'm like, what just happened? And I wasn't really very clear with the novel world. And I learned [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2377.6800000000003s)]
*  that the novelists had run out of material and the Hollywood showrunners were now writing the [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2383.76s)]
*  script. I'm like, ah, that's what happened. They switched to the good versus evil story. So they [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2388.4s)]
*  took a great story that was going to be how power corrupts, which clearly was the story. And in the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2395.04s)]
*  end, they made the dragon lady snap just because she heard the church bells or something like [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2402.4s)]
*  you. That's not a good sociological story. As a sociologist coming from Turkey, do the Star Wars [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2408.48s)]
*  prequels make sense to you? No. Why not? It's about power corrupting. Jar Jar Binks. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2415.12s)]
*  I mean, nothing. No, no movie with Jar Jar Binks makes sense to me. I refuse to have it make sense. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2423.2799999999997s)]
*  So but yes, it's kind of like the Star Wars sequels have the same sort of it. The power [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2431.12s)]
*  corrupting is a very important sociological story, but you can tell it badly, right? It happening [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2437.2799999999997s)]
*  overnight or you just have something evil in you just kind of take over. That's the ridiculous [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2444.8799999999997s)]
*  version of it. What happens is every moment you're thinking I'm doing the right thing. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2450.56s)]
*  Like you don't you almost never think, you know, let me go to evil things. You convince yourself [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2455.84s)]
*  you're doing the right thing till you lose your mind in it. And you have people around you who [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2462.0s)]
*  are just saying, yes, yes, you're doing the right thing. And that's the classic story of power. And [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2467.44s)]
*  I, I love movies like that. But you know, Jar Jar Binks just, nope. If you were speaking to an [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2472.16s)]
*  educated American who was somewhat informed about Turkey, but not well informed, what is it [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2479.52s)]
*  they're least likely to understand about the current leadership of Erdogan and the current regime [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2484.4s)]
*  that you could illuminate for them? What are we? I would like to first say, now that I have this [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2489.28s)]
*  opportunity, we do not have camels. I everybody asked me about this. I know this has nothing to [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2494.48s)]
*  do with Erdogan. The camels only exist in tourist areas, because everybody's convinced Turkey has [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2499.68s)]
*  camels. So I need to first correct that misunderstanding. I've never seen a camel in [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2504.88s)]
*  Turkey. I can verify this. Yeah, yeah, it is insane. Everybody always asked me about them. And I'm like, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2509.6s)]
*  what? So now that has been corrected. So Erdogan is a complicated figure for sure. And one of the [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2515.76s)]
*  things I think is less understood is that for a long time, he had, and he still has a genuine [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2523.76s)]
*  support base. And that's a very complicated, long story why that is. And right now, after 20 years [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2532.32s)]
*  in power, it's gotten more of a sort of a centralization of power story. So that's the first [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2538.88s)]
*  thing. And the second thing is when people want to understand Erdogan, sometimes they compare [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2544.7200000000003s)]
*  him to say, I don't know, leaders of Iran. And I'm kind of like, you want to look at [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2550.48s)]
*  Putin, you want to look at Hungary, you want to look at Brazil. I mean, so the on sort of the [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2554.88s)]
*  similarity there isn't necessarily I think, which religion or the strength of the religious [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2561.36s)]
*  beliefs as much as once again, a strong, popular populist, authoritarian leaning person getting [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2566.6400000000003s)]
*  elected and then sort of staying in power, and making sure he stays in power for a very, very [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2574.7200000000003s)]
*  long time. So it is actually, if anything, I would say it's a very western story. We have many [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2580.96s)]
*  examples of it around the world. It is not particularly a Middle Eastern version [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2587.76s)]
*  of the story, which there are many, but that's, I think, a different version. So I think that's [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2594.2400000000002s)]
*  largely misunderstood. Why did the Gazi protests fizzle out? It seemed promising, right? You were [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2599.0400000000004s)]
*  optimistic at one point, but something happened. You know, I was both optimistic and realistic at [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2604.96s)]
*  that point. And this is something I write about in my book, because by the time the Gazi protests [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2611.44s)]
*  that happened in 2013, I'd already been through the as a researcher, the Arab Spring, right? So [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2616.8s)]
*  I kind of knew the up and down wave. And one of the things that I think, and this is not necessarily [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2622.8s)]
*  a criticism or not criticism of social media, this is just kind of explaining the reality of what [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2630.0800000000004s)]
*  happened is that so in the past, if you wanted to have a movement, you necessarily have to build a [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2635.44s)]
*  lot of tools because you were out of power, right? You had to build a lot of tools. If you wanted to [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2641.52s)]
*  organize to say the Montgomery bus boycott in the 1950s and 60s during that time or the sort of [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2646.56s)]
*  March on Washington, you have to spend a lot of time just to march on Washington took, I think, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2652.7999999999997s)]
*  like six months just to do the logistics, right? You don't have Excel spreadsheets and things like [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2657.68s)]
*  that. And from an idea to March, it was about 10 years. So that kind of preparation work, arduous, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2662.32s)]
*  and it kept this movement weak, because you have to build that before you could do anything. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2670.8s)]
*  But if you did build it, right, you had something to stand on. Whereas right now with social media, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2677.6000000000004s)]
*  you can kind of overcome censorship like that's especially if, you know, the government's not [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2684.1600000000003s)]
*  really very up on it, which at the time they weren't. But you're not ready for what's coming. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2689.1200000000003s)]
*  So I feel like it's kind of like coming into a curve, like from going from zero to 100 miles an [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2693.6800000000003s)]
*  hour, and you're coming into a curve. But you haven't built the car, you don't have a steering [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2699.6s)]
*  wheel, like you just know how to speed up, right? And you see this in very many other aspects of [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2704.64s)]
*  society as well, where digital technology lets people scale up very quickly. And if you're [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2710.3199999999997s)]
*  Instagram, and you go from, you know, I don't know, zero to a million users or 10 million users, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2717.12s)]
*  well, Facebook can come by you, and you're great. So that kind of speed exponential growth is not [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2723.04s)]
*  a problem in many other areas. But whereas if you're a movement, that kind of speedy exponential [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2728.96s)]
*  growth without having built other parts of the infrastructure means that when the government does [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2734.56s)]
*  come for you, you don't have even a decision making system, you don't even know like, how do [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2740.8s)]
*  I respond to it. So when the Gizzy Park movement started, I went there, I went there to as a [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2747.04s)]
*  participant observer, I did like hundreds of formal interviews, I stayed in the park, I spent like, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2752.2400000000002s)]
*  the whole time essentially living there with everybody else and just observing. Even then, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2758.1600000000003s)]
*  when people ask me, you know, how is this going to end? Because they realize I was a researcher, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2763.2000000000003s)]
*  because I'm doing interviews, and they would ask and I already knew like in Egypt, my friends were [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2769.0400000000004s)]
*  in jail. And I was already demurring saying, I don't know, you're a researcher, you're not [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2773.1200000000003s)]
*  going to make predictions there. So I think the fizzling out of social media field movements, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2779.44s)]
*  it's not that they aren't impactful, they're just on a different trajectory, they start big. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2785.04s)]
*  And if they're in an oppressive, repressive environment, they can get crushed. Whereas if [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2791.68s)]
*  they're in a different kind of country, they could have time to build something. And I think we're [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2796.08s)]
*  seeing some of that in Western nations, like Black Lives Matter, whatever else you want to say, it is [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2801.7599999999998s)]
*  a sustained movement that has changed a lot of things in the country. But unlike say Turkey or [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2807.52s)]
*  Egypt, they're not going to face a government that's coming for them in the same degree, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2814.16s)]
*  say, you know, what happens in Egypt. Why does Islamic fundamentalism at least seem to be on [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2820.24s)]
*  the rise in Turkey? Well, if you go to Konya, right, it feels quite devout in a way. I mean, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2826.24s)]
*  not if 30 years ago. Well, it's actually also on the downside. I don't know when you've last been [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2831.2s)]
*  there. But if I was looking at the polls, and like the current under 30s are saying they're much less [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2837.12s)]
*  religious, I wouldn't really be completely sure like if and when this government changes, I think [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2843.68s)]
*  we'll have a better sense of it. When you have like a religious government in power for 20 years, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2849.3599999999997s)]
*  and if you're 30, like that's all you've ever known, it can actually create the opposite effect. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2854.3999999999996s)]
*  I think it's a little early to say the fundamentalism part is on the rise or not. I mean, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2860.24s)]
*  we have a more religious government. So there's more religious official stuff, and more encouraged [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2866.7999999999997s)]
*  and more sort of rules about it and allowances and alcohol is more expensive, for example, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2873.2s)]
*  and more restricted. Are people drinking less alcohol? I'm not so sure. You know, it's kind of [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2879.12s)]
*  like I think it's a little too early to figure out what the long term trajectory will be. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  Two final questions. First, let's say you're designing a trip to Turkey for us. Put aside [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2891.52s)]
*  COVID. Obviously, we're visiting Istanbul, but two weeks, where do you send us other than Istanbul? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2897.04s)]
*  Well, I have never been to Mardin. It's in the southeast region. It's both Assyrian, Kurdish, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2903.2s)]
*  and Armenian, and Turkish in history. So amazing and beautiful architecture, and I've never been [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2908.7999999999997s)]
*  there. So I would like to take us all on a trip that I'm coming along for Mardin, which is a place [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2916.24s)]
*  I heard a lot about. And the other place that I mean, everybody knows the Aegean, and I don't [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2923.9199999999996s)]
*  really need to explain it. It's the other side of the Greek islands. It's just the most beautiful [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2929.12s)]
*  place, but you know about it already. Another place that's I think less known is the Black Sea [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2934.4s)]
*  region, where you have dramatic green hills meet the sea. Not like San Francisco, because the hills [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2941.2s)]
*  are very steep and then you have a fairly little strip. So very different climates and visuals. And [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2947.44s)]
*  there's a lot of historic stuff there too, because it was, you know, obviously it was the Ottoman [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2953.2s)]
*  Empire for a long time, but before that it was the last bit of the, you know, the Greek East Roman [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2957.2s)]
*  sort of empires and countries too. So there's a lot of history there as well. So two interesting [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2964.16s)]
*  places outside the usual tourist places. Before we turn to the audience, last question from me, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2968.7999999999997s)]
*  what will you be doing next? For like writing? No, you're out here. You have public presence, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2975.3599999999997s)]
*  anything. Going to Turkey. Okay, any answer? All right. Besides the unpacking boxes, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2980.48s)]
*  I have moved to New York, which is wonderful. I'm going to live, I really miss living in a city. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2986.88s)]
*  I'm from Istanbul and I haven't lived in a city for a while, like full time. So that, and especially [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2991.44s)]
*  sort of as a pandemic kind of last phase, that's interesting. I am pondering to finally write a [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=2996.96s)]
*  book. When the Arab Spring ended, not ended, but when the first, like during the first phase of the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3003.36s)]
*  Arab Spring in 2011, I was there the whole time. Like I kept going, I was in Tahrir Square, I went [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3008.56s)]
*  to Tunisia, I went all over the region. And there are a lot of books that came out quickly [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3014.4s)]
*  at the time. And I just kind of resisted writing a book just then. I felt like, and I'm from the [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3019.84s)]
*  Middle East too, I felt like this is not over yet. And a lot of books were quite triumphant. And it [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3026.0s)]
*  was only after the Gezi protests and how they played out, I felt like I'm going to write a book [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3030.8s)]
*  and I feel like it's a more durable and balanced book. It's not for, again, social media. It's also [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3036.4s)]
*  not saying the movements were triumphant or not. But I had the sort of the gift and I gave myself [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3042.24s)]
*  sort of time to let it play out. So I feel the same way about the pandemic now. I feel like it [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3047.8399999999997s)]
*  was a stress test. And I think there's going to be a first crop of books that put most of the blame on [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3053.8399999999997s)]
*  Trump's lap, which is not unjustified. Like that administration has a lot, I think, to answer for. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3060.9599999999996s)]
*  But I think the things that it has shown us is much bigger than one administration's admittedly [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3068.64s)]
*  very real failings. So I'm thinking like maybe just maybe there is space for a book that looks [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3075.44s)]
*  at some of the things you are talking about, like, which is there's something like we have [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3083.04s)]
*  to revitalize how our society works and we haven't come to grips with it. So I'm thinking [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3088.24s)]
*  I might be writing a book. It will come out after the first crop of the post-pandemic initial. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3093.68s)]
*  Like there's probably dozens of books in the next year, but mine will come after all those are over. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3100.72s)]
*  Zeynep, thank you very much. Thank you. I will take questions from the audience and from the iPad. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3107.3599999999997s)]
*  So I'll start with the audience. Questions? So for those few people in the room who've never [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3115.04s)]
*  read Vabor, what's the right way to get started? I think the best way is to not read Vabor because [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3120.0s)]
*  you do not want to start there. Seriously, the language is so complicated, but I have a colleague. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3127.68s)]
*  I've never been in his department, but George Ritzer was a sociologist and he wrote a lot of [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3134.8s)]
*  sort of theory books and they're really good. And I believe he has one called McDonaldization of [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3140.32s)]
*  everything, but that's kind of like that's a very much a barbarian rationalization, but he has it on [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3147.84s)]
*  many other things as well. So I would read someone like George Ritzer to read about Vabor because [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3153.84s)]
*  his books are a lot more accessible. It reminds me of reading Ritzer. So I learned probability [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3160.4s)]
*  theory from a book in Turkish. It only exists in Turkey. It's written by someone from Turkey. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3165.52s)]
*  And the premise of the book is there's a little girl who wants to win at a game of dice and she loses [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3173.36s)]
*  because she's betting the wrong way. And then she meets someone says, I can teach you how to win this [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3180.96s)]
*  game. And then the book, it's just a novel. I still have the book. It's amazing. Walks you through [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3186.32s)]
*  probability theory, including, you know, walks you up to I think the binomial theorem. And it's like [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3192.08s)]
*  something you can read when you're in the third grade and understand. And at the end of the book, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3196.2400000000002s)]
*  the little girl discovers that, you know, there's textbooks and she says, that's probability. I hate [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3201.44s)]
*  it. Like my older sister reads it and hates it. And the sort of the person in the neighborhood [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3207.44s)]
*  who's been teaching our says that's because you have like this preconception that theory is [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3213.76s)]
*  something boring and dry, like probability is something boring and dry and complicated instead [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3218.96s)]
*  of, as we were talking something really exciting, understanding a bit better about, you know, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3224.32s)]
*  probability and probabilistic thinking is really empowering and fascinating. So that's the way I [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3229.76s)]
*  feel about sociology is that it's actually conceptually really powerful, but the theory [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3234.7200000000003s)]
*  part can be really dry because if you read it from like early 19th century person, that person is [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3239.6000000000004s)]
*  talking about early 19th century. That's boring and dry and crazy to you. Whereas what you need [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3245.44s)]
*  is somebody to do it now. And Ritzer does it for like 20th century. And it's really good. All his [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3250.5600000000004s)]
*  books are good. And I'm not sure if somebody's updated because with sort of the internet and [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3257.12s)]
*  stuff, we have 21st century stuff to bring in, but they're still equally valid, like institutions [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3262.64s)]
*  and the way they work. Humans are remarkably human. Question from the iPad. How would you [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3268.16s)]
*  convince a COVID vaccine skeptic? So it depends who they are, obviously. Someone from Staten Island, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3274.16s)]
*  and they walk into the room and they say, I don't trust the vaccine. I don't trust those authorities. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3281.92s)]
*  So the thing is, I'm going to go back to the sociology fallback, which is that people don't [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3286.56s)]
*  exist as sort of independent atoms. The person to convince that person is a friend, an acquaintance, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3292.32s)]
*  or somebody else from Staten Island. Right? So the way you want to deploy these convincing is [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3301.6s)]
*  that, and we have this from so much sociology. If I come to you and say, your field is terrible [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3309.2s)]
*  and you're wrong about everything, you're going to all of a sudden like me. Right? So if we want [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3314.24s)]
*  to convince people, we need to deploy the people on the ground that we have, whoever it is, who's [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3319.12s)]
*  closest to those people. So if you want to convince people in Staten Island, you got to sort of send [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3325.2799999999997s)]
*  people who live in Staten Island, who you can sort of work for this or whatever community it is. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3330.0s)]
*  And instead, we're like lecturing at them. And I'm kind of like, nobody likes being lectured. And [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3335.9199999999996s)]
*  even if the lecturing is all correct, it just doesn't work. So I would say, I would try to say, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3341.12s)]
*  hold on my Staten Island friend, I'm going to find you somebody who is somebody that you relate to, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3347.12s)]
*  who's going to tell you why you should get vaccinated. But there are still inroads we make, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3354.56s)]
*  right? On people getting vaccinated. If it all relied on peers, it'd be a kind of circularity. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3360.0s)]
*  So there must be some peers who start before the other peers do. And what convinced them? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3365.04s)]
*  That's what you should say to the person who's in Staten Island. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3370.4s)]
*  You could say you could be first, but I will not necessarily have a lot of authority. So the peer [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3373.36s)]
*  networks, I mean, they don't have to be like your sibling, right? They're heterogeneous. They just [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3378.7200000000003s)]
*  have to be somebody socially similar to you. So that's clearly one thing. And the one argument [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3383.52s)]
*  that I make to people a lot, that my most strong abstract argument that I think I can make, is that [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3389.12s)]
*  you're going to encounter this virus either through infection or vaccination, right? There's [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3396.08s)]
*  no not encountering this virus. You're going to, I've written this many times, you're going to [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3400.56s)]
*  eventually encounter it. So you either encounter in this full form, where anything can happen, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3404.72s)]
*  or you encounter what we have, which is just a spike, which will make you fine when if you [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3411.36s)]
*  do encounter the full form. So there's no avoiding the virus. It's just a question of, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3417.84s)]
*  do you want to fight it with your hands tied? Or do you want the defenses? So that's all I can say [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3422.8s)]
*  to people who, to whom I have no other relationship to. From the iPad, are there situations where [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3429.6s)]
*  public health and transparency are in tension? And in those cases, should the public health [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3436.08s)]
*  authorities either lie to people or simply deliberately not tell them the full truth? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3440.64s)]
*  I just cannot imagine where we should not tell people the truth. I mean, sometimes it gets [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3445.52s)]
*  complicated. For example, I do agree that for the most part that the vaccinated are back at [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3451.2s)]
*  baseline risk, but that's not the same as saying like we should not have any indoor mask mandates [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3458.3999999999996s)]
*  for now. Now there's been a sort of a crisis over that because people are taking it to mean the [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3464.24s)]
*  vaccinated is not safe, but that's not true. What you're saying is that you can't expect a business [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3470.08s)]
*  to differentially police. Are you vaccinated? Are you not vaccinated? And we're still both [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3477.52s)]
*  vaccinating people and we have immunocompromised people and we have children under 12 who are not [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3483.1200000000003s)]
*  even eligible. So while we work through this for a couple more months, perhaps it makes sense for, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3487.6000000000004s)]
*  especially if it's a less ventilated space, just to keep it up. So at that point, I wouldn't say [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3493.6000000000004s)]
*  you should wear a mask if you're vaccinated because you're at risk. I would just say, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3500.5600000000004s)]
*  I think you're fine, but the business can't just sort of check your vaccination card. We don't have [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3505.68s)]
*  something like that and this is how it's got to be. So even this is not very complicated. So I don't [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3512.48s)]
*  think there's any point at which, like even if you did lie and get away with it, it would eventually [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3517.12s)]
*  come out. It's 2021. There's internet, there's social media, like the stuff would come out and [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3522.64s)]
*  all you end up doing is creating less trust. But say you're vaccinating your 11-year-old. That to [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3528.4s)]
*  me is clearly a public good and we don't lie to people, but we don't quite hit them over the head [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3533.2s)]
*  with just how safe your 11-year-old really is unvaccinated, right? So we slant the distribution [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3538.3999999999996s)]
*  of information to get more people to vaccinate their 11-year-olds. Is that right or wrong? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3544.72s)]
*  I don't think we even have to do that because people are very risk averse with their kids, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3549.3599999999997s)]
*  generally speaking. So I think it's fair to say that your 11-year-old is almost certainly fine, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3554.96s)]
*  but I still want them not to risk the secular, right? Because when you have an unknown virus, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3561.12s)]
*  there's always like the post-viral syndrome that people talk about long COVID. It's [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3568.96s)]
*  probably not as bad as some of the reporting, but it's real and it's real for other viruses. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3574.56s)]
*  I mean, it's something we've long ignored. It's not just that. So at 11, you're still kind of [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3579.2799999999997s)]
*  close to a risky age. It might be a small risk, but I feel like we can tell people the truth. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3585.28s)]
*  It's not likely that your kid is going to die from this. It's really baseline risk for your kid. But [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3591.6800000000003s)]
*  if you could spare your kid, even the anxiety, because occasionally you could just be the [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3596.32s)]
*  unlucky person. I think we could just tell people that low, really low odds, but here's a free [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3601.6000000000004s)]
*  vaccine. Why wouldn't you take advantage of it? The argument against vaccinating 11-year-olds now, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3606.48s)]
*  for me, is that healthcare workers around the world aren't vaccinated. So that seems [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3613.2s)]
*  the wrong order of things. But once you take the supply part out of the question, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3618.72s)]
*  if you're 11, I'd be like, yeah, why risk the low but real side effects of the infection? Because [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3624.24s)]
*  they're going to get infected. There's no getting around encountering this virus. I think that still [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3631.52s)]
*  leans towards vaccinating young ones. From the iPad, what is your most controversial [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3636.96s)]
*  opinion? Controversial to whom? To those people who you respect. Not to anti-vaxxers, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3642.32s)]
*  not to crazy people, but the 20 people in the world you most respect. I understand. I'm just [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3649.1200000000003s)]
*  going to say something different now, but I think it's an interesting thing to expand on. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3653.52s)]
*  I think most of what I said in the past year that appeared to be controversial or contrarian [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3660.4s)]
*  is actually very straightforward and boring. Lab accidents and screw-ups happen. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3668.6400000000003s)]
*  Biomedical research has potential risks, especially if we can manipulate the viruses. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3675.0400000000004s)]
*  We should wear masks for respiratory pathogens. Widespread coverage for... [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3681.92s)]
*  Like you think the best donor for Bob is in Paris or some crazy view like that, right? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3690.1600000000003s)]
*  Which is purely false. Okay, so I think for example, I think US is a less racist society [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3695.12s)]
*  than most of Europe. It's because I lived in Europe and I have a feeling like this is where [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3702.96s)]
*  I kind of sometimes differ from my own intellectual circles is that they think of Europe as... Because [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3707.7599999999998s)]
*  they tend to see the social democrat side of it, right? Compared to the US, Europe is a lot more [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3715.04s)]
*  government-oriented in some ways, for good or bad, but it can be suffocated sometimes. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3720.64s)]
*  But it's actually a much more, in some ways, racist society in my experience than the United States. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3725.6s)]
*  Another thing I differ is that I think GDPR, the sort of the digital regulation, I think it was just [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3736.0s)]
*  at the wrong level. If anything, it backfired. I think you can't just regulate something by, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3743.04s)]
*  I don't know, wagging your finger across the pond sometimes. That just isn't going to work. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3748.8s)]
*  So I differ in some of those ways, like the way I look at Europe. And I think that's partly because of [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3753.36s)]
*  that I have an immigrant's view of the United States, which I think is in some ways more realistic. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3759.92s)]
*  But I've lived in Europe too, so I think a lot more positive feelings about certain things that might [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3766.4s)]
*  not be as apparent to somebody who's looking at Europe from this side of the Atlantic, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3772.8s)]
*  because some things look good if you're an American, but are not necessarily great [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3778.7200000000003s)]
*  if you're not, if you're living in Europe. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3785.1200000000003s)]
*  Question from the iPad. How does your background in programming affect your work as a sociologist [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3788.32s)]
*  and public intellectual? Oh, it's a great question. So the thing is, it's not just the [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3793.6000000000004s)]
*  technological side. For example, I did a lot of trying to understand, and I was going to write [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3800.0s)]
*  a book about that for the pandemic. I'm super fascinated by machine learning. And I think there's [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3805.68s)]
*  a lot of misunderstandings around it. And one of the reasons that I think I can do some of what I do [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3811.36s)]
*  is that I can read the papers. I'm not a machine learning researcher. I'm not going to develop [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3817.44s)]
*  advanced science or anything like that. But I understand what's going on in a way that [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3824.72s)]
*  someone who's just looking at the sociology of its impacts might not because of my background. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3829.8399999999997s)]
*  And I had the same thing happen with the pandemic. This is not like I actually used to teach [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3835.04s)]
*  sociology of pandemics because I thought it was really fascinating sociologically. But I was [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3839.12s)]
*  always interested in the science side too. So I didn't like start knowing nothing. I started [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3843.2s)]
*  knowing, yes, a lay person, but a professor, an educated lay person, and somebody who taught some [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3848.8s)]
*  of this stuff. So I had some level of reading. And whenever possible, I kind of just deepen. I read [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3855.2000000000003s)]
*  textbooks. I read like primary papers and a lot of fields that I'm trying to do sociological analysis. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3861.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's something we don't do enough of in the academy in that because we're so siloed. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3866.88s)]
*  And we treat it like dabbling. It's not dabbling if you do it right. Yes, you can do it in a bad [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3872.32s)]
*  way, but it's not dabbling to sort of get some level of understanding of a field. And you need [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3877.36s)]
*  to be careful. You need to be humble about what you're doing and then apply your own field, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3884.8s)]
*  sociology, to that base. So if you don't have any of the other, you can kind of get things wrong [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3890.48s)]
*  quite easily. If you're overconfident, yes, it can get into that heavily criticized dabbling where [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3899.28s)]
*  you're just completely out of your depth. But I think there's great value to be added from [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3904.64s)]
*  being, it's not really interdisciplinary. You're rooted in one discipline, but you're really not [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3909.68s)]
*  like you're going and learning stuff and you're interacting with the field directly as much as [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3915.52s)]
*  you can. So I think that's kind of how it's been broadly beneficial. Zainab, a real pleasure [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=543ElaaIMww&t=3921.2799999999997s)]
