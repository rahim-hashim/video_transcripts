# David Wolpe on Leadership, Religion, and Identity  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [February 15, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH0VqlPnzpE)
*  Thank you all for coming. This is my chance to ask you the questions I want to learn about.
*  So your latest book, it's called David, The Divided Heart, and the book of Samuel is probably
*  the greatest political biography of all time, one of the most significant books on politics.
*  So I'd like to start with some questions there. And in how you view that book, why is it that
*  David, if indeed you believe this, was a better king than Saul?
*  So first of all, thank you for inviting me to this grilling, the dialogue. I do believe
*  that David was a better king than Saul. The first, look, the first test of a king in the
*  ancient world is what David did that is remarkable, and that is he died in his bed. That's rare among
*  ancient and medieval kings, as you know, and so survival in and of itself is a test of merit,
*  even not speaking about in divine eyes, but just in human eyes. Also, in some way, Saul seemed to
*  have lost the confidence of the people, and while no contemporary analogies are intended in anything
*  that I say, you cannot underestimate the value of charisma in a political leader, and David had
*  tremendous charisma. So when the women of Israel went out into the streets and said,
*  Saul has killed thousands, but David has killed tens of thousands, that was already a signal that
*  Saul was going to fail and fall. So I think that on those two, just survival and charisma alone,
*  you would have to say that David was a more successful leader.
*  So if someone makes the argument that David was a better king because he never committed
*  idolatry, would you accept that description? A better king because he never committed,
*  well, no, because it's not clear that Saul committed idolatry. It's clear, pretty clear,
*  that David didn't. I would say, and also, yes, Saul is told to kill the king and to get rid of
*  all the Amalekites, and he doesn't do that, and that is mentioned again, that that was his failing.
*  And isn't that what appears to be a small thing, a big thing, or no?
*  Well, it's yes. The sin there, I mean, that's actually a very problematic sin,
*  where he's told you didn't kill enough people and you didn't slaughter the king when you were
*  supposed to. But the idea is that, the way the Talmud puts it, is that somebody who is
*  kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind. And the idea that your enemies have to be
*  dispatched or at least effectively subdued was something that Saul didn't have the stomach for.
*  And I would say in the ancient world, maybe that would make you an unsuccessful king.
*  So if the commands of God are not necessarily visible to the rest of us,
*  what for you is the implied political epistemology of the book? How do we know when we have a good
*  king, leader, president, if that's an important feature, and we as outsiders don't know who is
*  received what message or command from God? How do we know in general, or how do we know in a
*  book of the Bible? Because those could be two different... Sure. Okay. So I would say that it's
*  true in the... One of the problems with the Bible is that you can always say, how did the person know
*  that God was speaking to them? Since I can't, as Queen Elizabeth said, cut windows into people's
*  souls, I have no idea if God spoke to David. That's something you have to either take on
*  faith or not. What I do know is that David was successful in unifying the kingdom, subduing
*  rebellion, leaving a legacy of... A lasting legacy where people believed that he would lead to,
*  ultimately, to the Messiah, and also installing his son in the kingship, and his son succeeded
*  in building the temple, which became, for a long time, the center point of Jewish religion.
*  And he established Jerusalem as the capital, which if he had only done that, would have been
*  an extraordinary achievement. So if you want to attribute that to the fact that David listened to
*  God, and that the Psalms are, in fact, an expression of David's soul, I don't have a
*  problem with that. But if you want to be pragmatist about it and just look at results, so I would say
*  that's how you judge the success of a leader, then and now. If you think of it being an implicit
*  question in the book of Genesis, first, how is there a political order at all? And also, why is
*  it that brothers do not kill each other? And those, in Genesis, to my reading, are not at all resolved.
*  Then you have the book of Samuel and the David story. By the end of that,
*  what's the extra thing we've learned? What's the resolution to those questions?
*  To the questions of how is it that the political order is possible at a deep metaphysical level?
*  How is it that brothers don't kill each other? Is there any resolution?
*  Well, first of all, brothers not killing each other is always a provisional statement.
*  I say this with two of my brothers in the audience, and I think that it's fair to say that we have not
*  killed each other yet. But the beauty in some ways, let me first give you my sermonic answer.
*  The beauty of the book of Genesis is all through Genesis, brothers are fighting, even though they
*  don't kill each other in the end. And then the very last set of brothers, the reason that they
*  fight is because generally in one way the younger is preferred over the older and there are questions
*  of birthright and so on. And then towards the very last scene, there are two brothers, Ephraim and
*  Menasha. Menasha is the older, Ephraim is the younger. Jacob blesses as the grandfather, he
*  blesses the younger with the better blessing. And Menasha doesn't protest. He's actually kind of the
*  silent hero of the book. So I would say that there is a degree of acceptance that is taught
*  an unequal distribution of goods, if I can transgress into your field for a moment.
*  And that's the way the world is. And you have to accept that there will be different degrees of
*  talent and gifts and so on and so forth. And the acceptance of that, that is the acceptance of God's
*  gifts at unequal levels, is the way interpersonally brothers succeed in not killing each other.
*  And in terms of the establishment of a political order, I think there the idea, at least in Samuel,
*  what starts to happen is that there is an understood division between the political
*  order and the religious order. That is, Samuel's the high priest and the leader,
*  and he gets very upset when they want to have a king because he says, why am I not good enough?
*  The reason is because you need a political order that is different. You need separation, effectively,
*  of synagogue and state to some degree. Let's say you have a leader who has had several wives,
*  has served the interests of a foreign power, is very good at blame shifting.
*  Should that leader be as self-confident as David seems to be in the book of Samuel? Apparently.
*  I think, according to the standards of the time, having several wives was normative,
*  and they weren't sequential. They were simultaneous. So, as my friend Joseph
*  Talushkin says, polygamy does exist in the Bible. It's just never successful.
*  So, David does have many wives and very strained and interesting and complex relationships with
*  women. David has the most complicated and most described relationships with women of any character
*  in the Hebrew Bible. Those qualities that can be negative in David are, to some extent, positive.
*  One of the things that draws David out of the charge of simple narcissism is that he really
*  listens. He pays attention. He pays attention to women over and over again. He listens to what they
*  say and changes himself because of it. That's not a characteristic of men in the ancient world or
*  the modern one that you can rely on. So, I would say next to his hubris, there's a self-effacement,
*  and next to his charisma, there's also a receptivity. In the complex of his personality,
*  you can understand why people might look at him sort of to draw a very different political figure,
*  the way that at some point, I think it was Seward said about Lincoln, which is he's the best among us.
*  Let me press you on two of the things you say in the book. There are two things you said that
*  surprised me, so let me try to become unsurprised. I think it's on page 33, you said, of all the
*  characters in the book of Samuel, the one you could best imagine as also being a king is Jonathan.
*  Jonathan had a capacity for self-sacrifice. That surprised me because, again, I'm very much a
*  novice on this territory, but I think of him as a little too nice a guy and not strong enough in
*  the right way to actually be a king in that time. I think you're probably right. I could imagine
*  him as a king. First of all, he was the son of the king, so he was the natural heir. As we know,
*  that often happens, that the natural heir may not be the fitting king. Also, I thought that
*  Jonathan was the kind of person that people would be drawn to, but I would certainly, I think that
*  that's probably a worthy caveat. He probably would have gotten killed in the kingship in a way that
*  David was too strong a personality and too crafty an operator to allow himself to be killed.
*  On page 18, there's a claim you make, and I don't want to misquote you here, but I understand you
*  to be saying something like that Chronicles is like a boring retelling of the story of David.
*  That's almost a direct quote. I said Chronicles is Samuel made boring.
*  But again, coming to this as an outsider, I read Chronicles. I think of Chronicles as the very
*  long-run perspective saying that all of these events of the moment, which are so dramatic,
*  so emotional, so engrossing, they seem to be what's so relevant, just like we're all entranced
*  by Twitter or the daily news. But ultimately, what matters is the long run of history. Does the
*  kingdom survive? And it's actually the contrast between the extreme impersonality of Chronicles
*  and the deeply personal story of the book of Samuel that are these multiple dual or competing
*  layers or levels of wisdom, and that that's better than either book taken alone. Am I off base there?
*  I think that's a beautiful explanation. I would say two things about it. One is that if you're
*  writing the story of David and you're writing the story of David as opposed to say a political
*  analysis of David's kingship, then you want the story as its most dramatic, full of blood and fury
*  and sex and betrayal and so on. And that's in Samuel. The second is that Chronicles, it's not
*  just that Chronicles is, when I said it was made boring, what I meant was not that it's a dry
*  textbook as opposed to a bodice ripper of a romance novel, but that it takes the very humanness of
*  David and tries to sanctify him in a way that I think is untrue to David's character. So, you know,
*  it's the first time, for example, that the character of the Satan appears as an insider.
*  He incites David to do something bad so that way you don't have to blame David that he did it.
*  And in that sense, I think that Chronicles is a sort of, it's a sanitizing of the real history
*  of David, even though it may be a more interesting political, I don't know, more interesting, a
*  different political lens. Now let me try asking you about some well-known Jewish thinkers and
*  telling me what you think are their significance, either for Judaism or maybe for you personally.
*  And here's a man who sadly passed away not long ago, but Jacob Neusner.
*  So, Neusner was a very interesting character in a lot of ways. I think the brief biography,
*  and some of you may not know, Jacob Neusner was the most productive and prolific scholar
*  of the 20th century. Notice I did not say Jewish scholar. I said scholar. He wrote,
*  he's credited with almost a thousand books, maybe more. Have you read them all? I've read every,
*  I've read them at least once. I've read several of them, but I mean, some of them were produced
*  by his students and some of them are translations and so on. But even when you strip away all the
*  accretions, he still was a phenomenally productive scholar and in many ways changed the field of
*  Talmud studies, even though traditional Talmudists didn't like to think that,
*  in part because they didn't like to think that and in part because he was a notoriously difficult
*  character and I will leave it at that. But what Neusner did was something very simple,
*  which he learned from his beginning in Renaissance studies, which is when it says Rabbi So-and-so
*  told Rabbi So-and-so this, he started to question the attributions. How do we know that Rabbi
*  So-and-so said that? And he started to apply scientific study of texts in the 20th century
*  to the Talmud in a way that had not been done before and he had a very brilliant schematic mind.
*  So anybody who studies Talmud today, whether they say it or not, they're indebted to Neusner
*  and certainly my teachers were and they made sure that we were as well. Primo Levi, the Italian
*  writer. So Primo Levi is a problematic figure in some sad way because, you know,
*  although it's not a universal consensus, most people believe he committed suicide and
*  Elie Wiesel said that he died at Auschwitz 70 years later. The thing about Levi that is so
*  remarkable is that he's one of those rare, almost like Chekhov, he's a scientific mind
*  that is a brilliant literary writer. So when you read him on Auschwitz, you're reading very
*  careful, detailed prose that is heartbreaking. But there's no, he doesn't appeal to your heart,
*  instead he just tells you in a crystalline way what happened. And I'll give you one analogy that
*  I've never actually written about or seen written about and I thought of it years ago and I hope
*  that I'm remembering it right. There's one place, I think in Survival in Auschwitz, where Primo Levi
*  talks about a brick layer that the Nazis asked him to build a wall and he couldn't persuade himself
*  to build it badly. He just couldn't because that's what, I mean, that was his pride and it reminded
*  me that there's this great, that I haven't read for years and I'm sure I could find it, but there's
*  a de Montpessant story about a guy who's a circus performer and what he does is he fires arrows
*  into his wife's, into an apple on his wife's head and that's their circus act. And he starts to hate
*  his wife and he wants to kill her, but he can't bring himself to do it wrong. He can't do it.
*  And weirdly when I read the Levi thing and I thought of the de Montpessant thing and I thought
*  that in some ways that sense of I must be accurate all the time, that's what Levi is. It's like I can't
*  get this wrong and when you read that on Auschwitz and you know that the person that you're reading
*  won't exaggerate or distort, it makes it that much more painful.
*  Now I'm sure you know Rabbi Jonathan Sacks in his new book Essay on Ethics. He wrote the following,
*  the entire burden of the Torah from the beginning of Exodus to the end of Deuteronomy is about what
*  it is to create a free society as opposed to the slavery the Israelites experienced in Egypt.
*  Agree or disagree? Disagree. Why? Because if you take out the entire burden of the Torah,
*  I might agree, but I think there's a lot of other things that you could just as easily say
*  the Torah is about. So I think that it's too sweeping a statement. It's defensible to say
*  a large you know swath of the Torah is about this but not the entire burden.
*  Abraham Joshua Heschel, what's his importance? I think that I was, there were two thinkers who
*  were most important to me in different ways, although it's hard to say partly because of where
*  I grew up and I think one was Heschel the other Buber. Heschel, the reason that Heschel is so
*  important is less for the content of his thought, although sometimes that's powerful, than the
*  frequently breathtaking prose in which he put it and it was the first time that I read somebody who
*  could move me with the poetry of his language even though as I expressed to you earlier,
*  sometimes he's over flowery, sometimes he could have used a good editor,
*  but there are some passages where like in his little book the Sabbath which everybody who's
*  interested in Judaism or in God or theology should read where you think it's like
*  it's like just so extraordinarily beautiful that it's an illustration of what it talks about.
*  That is, it is something that touches your soul as it talks about the necessity for your soul to be
*  touched. So again, I'm an outsider in this dialogue but say I were thinking of converting to Judaism
*  and I were asking you about Hasidic philosophy. Yes. Now in terms of social connections, I probably
*  would fit better into your congregation than into a Hasidic congregation, but if I ask you on
*  theological grounds alone, is there a reason why I should be hesitant about Hasidic philosophy?
*  From the point of view of theology, what do you think is the greatest weakness there or your
*  biggest difference with it given how much you like Heschel? Well, first of all, I would say Heschel
*  had a Hasidic background but he became a modern scholar so there are things in Hasidic philosophy
*  that he would not subscribe to and among other things, I mean if you, it's just among us, right?
*  So look, there is going back to Yehuda Halevi and going through the tanya and woven through
*  Hasidism is the question of whether Jews have different souls from non-Jews in some
*  essential way. That I don't think you'd be particularly comfortable with, nor am I. It's
*  what a great American rabbi who passed away not so long ago, Harold Chilweiss, used to call
*  metaphysical racism. But if it's correct, right, I'll accede to it. I'm a reasonable man. If it's
*  correct, I would expect you that you would as a reasonable man, but I certainly don't believe it.
*  So the second thing I would say that might give you pause about Hasidism is theurgy,
*  which is, and this is a deep Kabbalistic belief, this is where if I can go on a mini rant about
*  tikkun olam, and I say this deliberately at Sixth and I, tikkun olam has nothing to do with saving
*  the whales. It doesn't. Tikkun olam is actually not a synonym for social action even though
*  everybody uses it that way. Tikkun olam, please by all means, let the record reflect that there
*  were scattered applause. So tikkun olam is a Kabbalistic term that is a term from Jewish
*  mysticism in which you do meets vote in the world to fix breaks in creation and in God, okay?
*  And that means that you're doing tikkun olam when you wrapped fill in in the morning just as much
*  as when you give tzedakah, when you give charity, when you keep kosher just as much as when you,
*  you know, I don't know, when you're kind to animals. Every meets va is tikkun olam. Now,
*  the idea that there are breaks in God that human beings can affect is a beautiful idea, but if
*  you're a rationalist, it's a hard idea to absorb. But if I defend Hasidic philosophy and I say
*  there's something wondrous about the world, yes, a kind of eminence which maybe other traditions
*  have neglected and it was a resurgence in Judaism. It was part of the Enlightenment. It happened at a
*  time where a Judaic philosophy and life was having a lot of problems. It was highly modern. If I think
*  about a lot of 19th century or even early 20th century Jewish writings, that's arguably the most
*  dynamic tradition, again, at that turning point. And in terms of capturing the beauty of existence
*  in a way that reflects how we moderns would call a subjective perspective on that,
*  isn't that the most profound branch of Judaism or no? Okay, well, you asked me to critique it. Sure.
*  You didn't ask me what was good about it. Now you're asking what was good about it. So what I would
*  say, I don't want to call it the most profound branch of Judaism. I don't think that you could
*  say, for example, that the Vilna Gaon who represented the Mitnagdim, those who opposed Hasidism,
*  certainly was not less profound than the Baal Shem Tov. What I would say is that Hasidism,
*  which is a tradition that I deeply love and in some ways my greatest religious hero, was a very
*  offbeat, strange Hasidic rabbi called the Kotzka Rebbe. Hasidism, what it did was, at least from
*  the Baal Shem Tov, is it sought, yes, to restore the sense of God's imminence in the world, the sense
*  of joy in connecting to God and to other people. It expanded the expressions of religious ecstasy
*  in dance and song and also very powerfully and importantly in religious stories. Hasidic stories,
*  especially the stories of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, are the most famous example, but not the only
*  example by far. Hasidic stories are an immeasurable contribution to the world treasury of spirit. So
*  all those things absolutely are true. If we end up elevating imminence over transcendence, do we in
*  some ways neglect Torah study and the special role of Israel too much? So this is a constant back and
*  forth and argument. Heschel was criticized for when he wrote about the Sabbath for calling it a
*  cathedral in time for not being terrestrial enough in some ways and so he wrote a book about Israel
*  called Echo of Eternity. Yeah, I mean there are those who see God as unutterably far and those who
*  see God as unbearably near and the Talmud and Jewish tradition and not only Jewish tradition,
*  Christianity bridges that gap obviously with the personhood of God. Judaism does not. Judaism
*  believes that both exist simultaneously. The rabbis say that God is as close as your mouth to your
*  ear. In other words, God hears what you say as easily as you do and yet there is no representation
*  of God in this sanctuary. God is not invisible because that suggests that God has a body but
*  you can't see it. It's like if you put a hat on God you would see the hat go down the street
*  but God is intangible like love, like justice. That is, God doesn't have a physical being and that
*  makes God transcendent and in some ways incredibly distant and I think that that's important
*  because what I always say to especially to high schoolers when I talk about God, I begin the
*  conversation about God with this. We're going to discuss what God is or what God isn't and so on
*  but I said in the Jewish tradition think about let's say they're 15 or as adults. When you were
*  two years old could you imagine what an adult is? Not only could you not imagine it but you couldn't
*  even imagine what it is that you couldn't imagine, right? You don't know what your gaps are when you're
*  two or three. Now God in the Jewish tradition, the distance between God and human beings is
*  infinitely greater than the distance between a two-year-old and a 20-year-old. So as soon as we say
*  God's imminence or God's transcendence, realize that we're caught in this net of metaphors about
*  something we can't comprehend. Is it permissible to play chess on the Sabbath or if I offer a
*  pawn sacrifice am I a gambler? Yes and no and one day I hope to find out.
*  How would you alter or improve rabbinical training?
*  I have given this a lot of thought. Let me just mention one area.
*  When I speak to rabbinical students I tell them all the time that the single most valuable
*  commodity you have as a rabbi, you can answer that yourself and then I'll tell you what I think,
*  your voice. Most people are going to come in contact with you when you speak to them,
*  not all of them but most. There'll be more people who come to your services than the number of people
*  at whose bedside you will sit as they die and yet most rabbis, most people don't know how to speak.
*  That and that training which is given, we have homiletics classes but the ability to communicate
*  what words to use, what examples to use, how to train your voice so that people can understand you,
*  how often have you been in front of speakers who you have to tell them 10 times put the microphone
*  closer please I can't hear you right? That ability is woefully underrepresented I think
*  in the rabbinic community and it's very much to our detriment.
*  I've thought about social media quite a bit and written on them and I have two questions
*  relating social media to Judaism. If you think about the tradition of the Torah, the Torah is so
*  much itself commentary on the Torah. Yes. And there's Mishnah and Talmud, everything's commentary
*  upon commentary upon commentary but there's something about social media that seems to act
*  to strip away context and people who write for mainstream media will tell you this. Well I wrote
*  an article that ended up on Facebook in a very different setting than how I intended it to be
*  read and you can say all you want are the hyperlinks are there but people don't click through.
*  And what do you think is the intellectual future of a belief system based on commentary on
*  commentary on commentary now injected into a world with this technology that so strips away
*  context and just gives you some bold statement of something? I think that Judaism has the same
*  problem that any thick civilization has in a world in which as you say context is stripped away and
*  not only is context stripped away but attention to any one thing is is scantor and less than it
*  used to be. So for example a lot of Jewish commentary is based on your recognizing the
*  reference that I make. Who recognizes references anymore because people don't spend years studying
*  books and so what I would the the optimistic take on that is that the availability with
*  with ease of the vast libraries of Jewish learning at your fingertips will create a more
*  conversant community and in some ways I think that has happened. The
*  negative is that Jewish culture will get thinner and thinner and Judaism as you said depends on a
*  very deep and thick culture. If I look at the history of the arts and other areas I see a
*  tendency for a kind of centralization of the past. So I think today actually many more people read
*  Shakespeare than they did 30 years ago but older plays and fiction are in general less read.
*  More people read Jane Austen but the second tier authors from that time are less read. Maybe from
*  the 1960s it will be the Beatles but you know the birds will fall away whatever. Do you see that
*  happening with Jewish philosophy and with the Hebrew Bible? There's a kind of centralization
*  of what people know and are falling away of what well I think what you're describing is something
*  that is that is a normal historical process. I mean the commentary that we have is a small fraction
*  of the commentaries that were written. There were always people diving into obscurity right and
*  people who wrote and their books like Hume said his book was stillborn from the press. There were
*  always such people and so of and you never know what's going to survive. So I have no idea who
*  from the 20th century for example will survive. There's a sense in which I think you know
*  when they say history is the final judgment is never written because authors are being revived,
*  they're being rediscovered and the same thing is true with certain commentaries and books and ideas.
*  So as long as they are available and accessible and in this the internet is an invaluable addition
*  to the continuity of learning somebody will be able in 500 years to rediscover a book that we
*  may think is gone forever and suddenly it will it will live again. I worry sometimes that electronic
*  media won't have the durability of good old paper. There are books centuries old you can still read.
*  I have two questions from readers. This is a blog reader of mine quote why do so many American
*  Jews leave Judaism when say Canadian Jews don't?
*  So I think I'm not I'm not sure about the statistics of that and I've spoken up in Canada
*  a few times and it's not as though they don't they're not plagued with many of the same problems
*  although maybe they're a little bit in this sense behind the assimilation rate of American Jews
*  but I think that the reason that American Jews leave Judaism is is some of it is very clear.
*  You know it's first of all it's what Irwin Kristol used to say he used to say the complaint that the
*  Jews made about the non-Jews used to be that they kill wanted to kill us and now it's that they want
*  to marry us. When you say to a child I want you to go to the best schools live in the best neighborhoods
*  work in the best firms but don't fall in love that's too nuanced a message. So the degree to
*  which neighborhoods were coherent and unvarying and constant was the degree to which there was
*  a great deal of in-marriage and communal raising of children and continuity of heritage and that's
*  still true in some Jewish communities and more true in Canada because there's less mobility
*  but in an age of mobility where people don't have extended families and where
*  intermarriage rates are what you would expect from a tiny minority in a big majority where
*  where there's a lot of cultural sharing it's not surprising that a countercultural tradition
*  which demands as you said knowledge and is reliant to a great extent on another language which
*  Americans won't do unless I guess it's Chinese these days. So I mean the the the inability of
*  Americans for example American Jews to learn Hebrew is a sort of intellectual scandal in one way
*  because Judaism really does have a sacred language in another way I suppose it's expected because
*  that's what Americans are like and and so I'm not it's not a shock even though it's a great sadness
*  and I don't think that it is the Jewish tendency is to say well Judaism has not been presented this
*  way or we haven't given it that twist or the leaders haven't done this but I think that that's
*  a function of standing against a tide and I don't know what would reverse that tide but it's a
*  it's a difficult thing. Second reader question do I have to believe in God? Do you Tyler? The reader.
*  Well you have to give me what's the end of that sentence do I have to believe in God in order to?
*  No do I have to believe in God? Well no obviously not since I've since I've had a whole as you know
*  a whole series of debates with atheists obviously there are people who don't and I didn't myself for
*  for a long time. If you're asking do I have to believe in God to be a Jew? I think that's what
*  was implied. The answer clearly is no you don't have to believe in God to be a Jew that's not
*  definitional it's not definitional. All of these conversations simple now but okay no one better
*  all right then I won't go on from there. Okay all of these conversations there's a segment in the
*  middle called overrated or underrated. Yes I know. And I mentioned something to you feel free to
*  pass the goal is not that you have to offend anyone but the first on the list overrated or
*  underrated Los Angeles as a city.
*  In one way overrated and in another underrated. Please explain. Oh okay it's overrated in its
*  in its the degree to which people think of it as a dream factory as an ideal place in the world
*  as a you know as a as a cloud as a cloud city but it's under it's underrated in two ways first of
*  all in its tremendous natural beauty which if you haven't been there really it's tremendously
*  beautiful. There are mountains in the middle of the city coming from Philadelphia I didn't know
*  what they were doing there and and it is much more interesting deep ramified filled with all
*  sorts of intellectual cultural activity than people on the east would think and to dismiss a
*  city of I mean look one one out of every 10 people in America lives in California to dismiss them all
*  as fruits nuts and flakes is is silly. The Israeli television show Srugeem. Underrated. Tell us why.
*  More people should watch it. Why is it special? Because it tells you about the life of a very
*  important segment of Israeli population which are Srugeem means knitted knitted kippot that is
*  modern orthodox which is a very important sort of straddling population in modern Israel and
*  most American Jews don't know about it and it will and it will teach you. One thing I like so much
*  about the show is how it maintains erotic tension. It's a great problem from the 20th century onwards.
*  If you have a romantic dilemma it's not the 19th century yet well why don't they just get divorced
*  or why don't they just sleep together or why don't they just whatever and Srugeem you have
*  a setting where that tension is maintained. That's why in a beautiful essay although slightly
*  problematic many years ago Trilling said that Lolita was was the the modern novel of love.
*  The reason is he said all love require all real love stories require an obstacle and usually it
*  was you know adultery or something like that he says but when all barriers have been leveled
*  and the only obstacle less left is an adult may not touch a child. It was part of Nabokov's genius
*  to make that into a love story which is to some extent what Lolita is even though at the same time
*  of course you feel revolted by the reality of what it's about but that's a very extreme way of going
*  back to what you said which is that religious stories can still do that because there are rules.
*  In a rule-less society love stories have no erotic tension no barrier nothing to vault over.
*  The Iran nuclear deal overrated or underrated? Way overrated and I wish it hadn't I mean I
*  think that it I think that it will prove a mistake I think a bad mistake having said that.
*  I also want to say what I said when when I spoke against it I want to say one other thing though
*  which is when the Iran nuclear deal came out all of a sudden people who had never been
*  who knew nothing about nuclear physics and I include myself except that they watched the Simpsons
*  were pronouncing on whether it was a good idea or not. I don't I can't speak in that in those
*  words but I think that any deal first of all knowing something about Iranian culture because
*  so much of my congregation is Iranian and any deal where the American side didn't leave the table
*  even once is to me by definition a bad deal by definition so so I I hope I hope to God that I'm
*  wrong but I I think overrated. Speaking of Islam what is it that's especially beautiful in Islam?
*  Well first of all I think that in a lot of ways Islam shares more with Judaism than Christianity
*  does. First of all it's a it's a it's a religion of the transcendence of God right it's a religion
*  of law and commentary and and and I and I have a theory for why that is and Christianity isn't why
*  Judaism and Islam are if you want to hear the theory. Sure let's hear the theory. Okay here's my theory
*  my theory is that's because Christianity grew up in the Roman Empire so the laws were taken care of
*  but Moses and Muhammad had to create a people in the desert. Right. So you needed civil law as well
*  as criminal law and the other thing I think that is that is beautiful about Islam although today
*  in some ways very scary about Islam is the enormous power that it has for large populations
*  who one day know very little about it and yet the next day feel tremendous devotion to it something
*  that can some belief system that can do that is you know that that's worth paying attention to
*  on its own terms not just from the outside. If you think of the portrayal of David the David story
*  in the Quran and you compare it to that in the Hebrew Bible do you think that reflects something
*  that later becomes troubling or do you just think it's a you know I think well this is part of a
*  much larger question there are a lot of differences between the Quran and the Hebrew Bible. David is
*  one thing the Quran the Quran is and this in this you should excuse me for the home team I like
*  Judaism much better the Quran is very unwilling to allow any sinfulness in its heroes. He's much
*  more heroic David as much more as much more as is Moses as is everyone in I mean the story has it
*  the story right exactly so so I like the idea of flawed heroes I like the notion that that that
*  there isn't this whitewashing and I feel that the Quran does that but but obviously I'm not a Muslim.
*  When you look at Michelangelo's David statue in Florence yes do you feel that's quote unquote
*  your David or is that a Christian David being portrayed?
*  Huh. And if so what's the difference? I feel that the here's what I would say he's no he's portraying
*  the Hebrew David but the idea of having such a magnificent David statue is a Christian idea
*  so if I could say it that way. Very good answer. On Islam if we look at Islamic countries in the
*  world today we've all noticed in different ways this is a generalization but it seems to me a true
*  generalization their ability to be stable democracies seems problematic at least right now
*  and I'm not just talking about the Middle East if you look at places like Bangladesh Malaysia
*  other parts they're somewhat democratic but they don't seem to mature into quote unquote normal
*  democracies the way say South Korea and Taiwan have and of course much of the Middle East they're
*  not close to being democracies and why at the deepest level you could explain as a matter of
*  intellect theology metaphysics has the doctrine of the religion ended up correlated with this result?
*  If I were wise I would say that I'm not I'm neither an expert in Islam nor in politics and
*  therefore I would beg off this question but I'm not going to because I think that there is incumbent
*  it is an intellectual necessity of the time since I think there is no question that jihadist Islam
*  is right now as great a threat I don't want to say the greatest. I'm sure but not the extreme.
*  I'm talking about but I'm just saying so so there is a necessity I'm saying to put some
*  intellectual pressure on the question of why it isn't creating societies of healthier political
*  climates. I would say if I had to pick one thing that is at the heart of Islam that is
*  that is anti-democratic it is the concept that's very deep that is in the very name of the religion
*  of submission because a population that is trained essentially to submit is a population
*  that will create authoritarians and so I think that the that the recalcitrance I mean when you
*  think about Israel the founders of Israel none of them came from democracies they came from Russia
*  they came I mean they came from Eastern Europe they came from the Levant they didn't know from
*  democracy and yet why did they create a democracy because they were all argued with each other
*  seriously they all did that's like my friend Joseph Epstein has a great line he said Jews don't listen
*  they wait and I think that and and that idea that the disputatious culture of the Talmud and so on
*  it's good for democracy and I think that the culture of submission can be corrosive to it
*  some questions about Israel if I may sure let's say you're talking to someone who is Jewish and
*  who is pro-Israel in a broad sense and would consider themselves a Zionist but they don't
*  have a deep theological belief in the content of the Torah or the Hebrew Bible they may not even
*  believe in God okay and they're posing the question well should I live in Israel or should I live say
*  in the United States Canada other places and that they're feeling some despair Israel's a
*  wonderful country I've been several times myself they might perceive higher danger I'm not even
*  sure that's correct there's a somewhat lower standard of living and if they ask you without
*  invoking theology which won't persuade them what's the best case for choosing Israel rather than
*  leaving or not going at all what would you say I think probably the best non-theological case
*  for choosing Israel is that you would be part of an astonishing experiment that is the revival of
*  a people in its land after thousands of years in an attempt to create something that is important
*  and lasting and a legacy that involves tradition but is not enslaved to it and if you want to see
*  where your people since this is a Jew who's asking where your people is determining its own
*  destiny in a world that too often determined its destiny for it the only place where that is
*  happening on in a full range of areas is in Israel say it's an American Jew and he or she says to you
*  well maybe that's begging the question is Israel my people or America my people and I would say
*  that's too binary a question as an American Jew I don't feel like I have to say this one is and that
*  one isn't what isn't what is binary for the most part I guess is is where you live you have to live
*  either here or there so it depends what adventure you choose to be a part of but that's the adventure
*  of Israel now a question on the settlements which are a hot issue now thanks a lot I know this is
*  very controversial now I'm myself a natural born contrarian so if I hear a lot of people criticizing
*  something my natural instinct is to try to defend it so I'm going to try to lay out I'm an economist
*  I've studied game theory what might be a case from an Israeli nationalist perspective for the
*  settlements and I don't want you to agree or disagree I just want you to tell me if I have
*  understood the case correctly or not okay okay so if I'm an Israeli nationalist I would think
*  a few things I would think there's a danger of a future technology coming along maybe rocket
*  technology that would have the potential say to shut down Tel Aviv airport if Iran or some other
*  hostile country got nuclear weapons there could be a possible nuclear umbrella used to protect
*  terrorist forays into Israel and that there's some future game coming where one needs a kind
*  of chit or pushback or bargaining power or leverage and furthermore on top of that
*  one always wants to keep an option over the notion that yes there would be a greater Israel
*  but a lot of the current Palestinians would become what are now called Israeli Arabs at a
*  higher standard of living and possibly higher level of political liberties and maybe that
*  wouldn't be all of what are now the territories but that maintaining an option on that relative
*  to what else might possibly happen which could be terrible who knows that is itself valuable
*  and that to have a kind of action on each of those two margins actually requires that
*  settlements continue now again I'm not asking you to agree or disagree but have I understood
*  the case Naftali Bennett would be proud of you yes you have understood the case okay now
*  just from an Israeli nationalist perspective would you agree with that case I would agree with parts
*  of that case but which parts not what I what I would say is that that the problem with the
*  case is it doesn't take into account two parts of the calculus that are important that are important
*  pieces of this one is that is an element of security to to allow your neighbors to feel a
*  certain way about their neighbors right and therefore if you build in total disregard of
*  the people in the neighborhood that's not going to encourage goodwill that's the first part of the
*  case that I would that I would urge and then the and and by the way this this works in in in
*  extending circles around the world that Israel is not an island and the opinion of the world also
*  matters in this and the second part of the case is that the idea that ultimately the population
*  around you will be reconciled to this in one way or another the end game doesn't work for me
*  um I don't think that that eventually the Palestinians will be absorbed into Israel and
*  will feel okay about it if their standard of living is high enough or and of course if they're
*  enfranchised then then it's very hard to imagine a Jewish state right so but there are other parts
*  of the case that I absolutely subscribe to so and let's say you took a cosmopolitan perspective so
*  imagine you're not Jewish never been to Israel you're some guy in Western Australia right and
*  Israelis Palestinians they're just names on a map to you and you're waiting everyone's interests
*  and desires equally how then does the case look to you for the settlements I mean I think if it's
*  fairly presented it would well first of all I the other part of the case I want to say there are
*  settlements in their settlements and the word settlements is way too broad way too broad because
*  there are settlements that everybody knows I mean with a nod and a wink they're always going to be
*  Israel they were always going to be Israel in any negotiation they're going to be Israel and they
*  are still called settlements but they're not settlements and then there are outposts in the
*  middle of you know Yenneveld to the middle of another world where there are six guys and a goat
*  and and that's also called a settlement the I think that the case would appear like most
*  like most such cases like Kashmir like Nagorno-Karabakh as mixed as both sides have very
*  powerful arguments and the only people I suspect along with you the only people whose arguments I
*  almost I bridle at automatically are people who don't see that there's another side here
*  because if what I would say look I used to this is the analogy I used to give it's now a little
*  bit out of date but I used to say what would happen I mean think of Hamas in Gaza what would
*  happen if Khomeini had taken over Texas how do you think the United States would react you think they
*  would say well look to stay we should negotiate I mean this is a this is a serious existential
*  issue on the other hand you're not dealing with an alien body that has come and taken over your land
*  and so I think that they would feel like this was a mixed and complicated issue and and neither side
*  can be can be painted with too black a brush I am agnostic on the question if you're wondering
*  what is the under observed under noted trend in contemporary Israel of importance
*  I would say probably what strikes me when I visit Israel is that there is a
*  a an increasing dissatisfaction and disaffection with all political life and activity that is
*  dangerous for the country because the the left wing is virtually declawed
*  the religious right is not really a political entity they they negate the political legitimacy
*  of the country even as they support right-wing policies and and so you're you're raising a
*  generation that I think doesn't feel um and where does that disengagement come from
*  an endless struggle over the same issues that never seems to change and never seems to go away
*  and seems and seems to get worse how much do you think income inequality is a driving issue in
*  Israel today that's yeah but I don't think I see you said you said an unnoticed sure there have
*  been demonstrations in the streets about income that's somewhat unnoticed in this right okay maybe
*  unnoticed in this country yeah no income inequality is a huge issue in Israel especially because
*  in Israel unlike in the United States Americans should forgive me for this there's a sense of
*  national solidarity in a different way as there is in small countries like small countries feel
*  like someone in my country who's like me shouldn't be poor I don't think Americans feel like somebody
*  in New York doesn't quite feel that way about Appalachia like well we're both Americans you
*  shouldn't be poor the same way that someone in Jerusalem might feel that about someone in Netanya
*  you know so now let's say you're talking to someone who's going to Israel they've been before
*  quite possibly they're Jewish they're familiar with the major sites and you're giving them
*  advice about something else they might do or see that they haven't thought of what is it that you
*  would recommend other than the obvious I don't know whether this is the obvious or not but
*  I mean less visited and among my favorite sites is the graveyard in Tzvat which contains the graves of
*  most of the most famous Kabbalists of the time including Luria including the man who wrote
*  and they're all there and you can and you can stand on the hills of Tzvat and see the sun
*  set and it's it's a magical experience now that you mentioned the Kabbalists why is there so much
*  sex in the Zohar and so much talk of devils and is that really part of the Jewish tradition or is
*  that going beyond and it's non-religious speculation say well the sex part in all seriousness is that
*  is I think the the only metaphors for not the most powerful metaphors for human intimacy are
*  sexual metaphors sure and so when you're talking about intimacy with God it's very hard to avoid
*  like zivug which means coupling or you know or at least some other parts of Judaism it's
*  quite kept at a distance in truth that's true but but it's it goes back to the Hasidic question you
*  asked before which is this sense of intimacy with God is very hard to feel without any sort
*  and to express rather without any without recourse to some kind of sexual metaphor
*  so and the role for devils in the Zohar is that simply a mistake I think it's a lot of I think
*  it's a lot of the fact that it was written in medieval times when devils were you know
*  proliferated and if you is it part of Judaism well it's part of Jewish folk culture in the same way
*  that if you read the stories of Isaac by Sheva Singer you'll get a lot of angels and devils and
*  so on but but is it part of the biblical tradition no it's a little bit more part of the Talmudic
*  tradition but it grew and grew as people believed you know in in a world lit only by fire that there
*  was there were magical creatures all around them speaking of that era the book the kusari which
*  you've written about you mentioned the author before Halevi from the 12th century why is that
*  an important book for Judaism it's important book for Judaism because it it the the way it's
*  structured is all these different religions come to the king of the kusars who historically
*  converted to Judaism at least that's the best history we have and it makes a case for Judaism
*  against other religions and Judaism generally did not engage in polemics against other religions
*  and this really was the foundation stone of it and it happened because of the golden age of Spain
*  and where there was a lot of interaction with other religions and Jewish philosophy was sort of
*  born out of unlike the Christian tradition it philosophy wasn't native to Judaism it was born
*  out of an encounter with other cultures and a need to explain ourselves and and it was written by one
*  of the great poets of medieval times who also was a was a distinguished philosopher so and it's
*  written in the form of a dialogue as you know a conversation and Leo Strauss wrote on this he was
*  himself Jewish though I think probably not a believer and he suggested that as with the works
*  of Plato and Hume the fact that it was done as a conversation and dialogue meant not that it was
*  deliberate on truths but many things were deliberately unsaid and there was a hovering ambiguity to the
*  final content about the relative status of religion philosophy and whether prophecy is
*  something truly spiritual or can be naturalized to some degree do you agree with that reading yeah
*  well he was very I mean as we know he was very fond of things unsaid sure Leo Strauss that was
*  that was his bread and butter and um yeah I there is there's a debate in there's a debate in Jewish
*  philosophy between Maimonides and Yehuda Halevi about whether prophecy is something that is
*  divinely gifted or something that you can achieve and and while Halevi is on the gifted side
*  he's Halevi I want to say is is represents the non-rationalist strain of Jewish philosophy as
*  Maimonides represents the the rationalist strain and so for the and that's why that book
*  um nurtures the Hasidic tradition from afar um and that that idea that that comes from a poet makes
*  a lot of sense my last question before we turn over to audience questions and some people have
*  said they're not going to leave until you tell us the correct answer to this one uh-oh
*  book two of Maimonides is creation eternal yes or no
*  yes or no
*  we'll see um or not right yeah we're not uh I I would look I think that um Jewish faith
*  rises or falls Jewish faith whether the Jewish people does is as yet an unasked question but
*  Jewish faith rises or falls and not on whether creation is eternal but whether God is and so
*  I don't think that that's a question for Jewish dogma whether creation is eternal or not
*  as long as God is we're good yes Yana so I actually have a question about Maimonides
*  and your kind of view of the evolution of Jewish thought the evolution of like the history of
*  Jewish thought as it relates to Maimonides I mean two things one do you think there was something
*  lost uh something important that was lost in Maimonides codification of the law
*  that we kind of don't have access to anymore today because of that development and then how much of
*  kind of the work of Maimonides changed the course of Jewish thought in a way that maybe
*  wouldn't have happened anyway with kind of the advent of modernity
*  um so I would say an answer to the first one how much what did we lose with Maimonides aggregation
*  of Jewish law with the Mishneh Torah so what Maimonides wanted to do was take all of this
*  messy giant Talmudic and other tradition and and make it simple and one of the things that he did
*  that he later said he regretted but didn't have the chance to fix was he didn't add footnotes
*  so we don't know I mean scholars have spent generations trying to reconstruct the sources
*  of Maimonides that's a lot that was lost because among other things he might have been basing it
*  on readings and manuscripts that we don't have that's what and also anytime you have a fixed law
*  you rigidify the practices of communities because then people say well it's not in the book so you
*  can't do it so yes a lot was lost but I mean I think probably more was gained in terms of whether
*  he changed the course of philosophical of Jewish history I think you almost can't say no because
*  Maimonides is probably the single most important figure in Judaism certainly post Talmud he is the
*  single most important figure and and he did bring in but and and what he changed which some people
*  like and some don't is he made people who are Jewish rationalists comfortable and people who
*  are not Jewish rationalists forced to argue that it was okay not to be rationalistic that to think
*  of God as omniscient omnipotent and benevolent like you do in a philosophy class is not the only way
*  to think about God and that's why the Hasidim needed to reinvigorate the Jewish tradition in
*  a sense so you know on balance glad we had him next question okay so this is a general question
*  when I went on birthright we talked a lot about the idea that everything happens for a reason
*  in the Jewish religion and so I wanted to know your beliefs and your mindset on when you experience
*  things in life that are really bad and like for instance a lot of nice people and good people
*  passing away or just anything bad that happens in life I guess your belief on that and if you still
*  believe everything happens for a reason okay I'm going to try to make this it's really as quick as
*  possible but but give me some allowance for the fact that I'm making it very quick first of all
*  I don't believe at all that everything happens for a reason not at all I think there's a lot of
*  randomness in the world I think the attempt to say everything happens for a reason can lead you to
*  some moral obscenities like oh this kid in the Sudan who was born with amoebic dysentery and lived
*  for three years and suffered and died it happened for a reason yeah the reason is because the world
*  is unfair that's the reason the now why the world is unfair I have a theory about but before I get
*  that let me just say the question of life is not why did this happen to you but what will you do
*  with it given that it happened to you that's the question that does God give you the power to make
*  something out of what has happened to you even though that doesn't it's like when I got cancer
*  a couple times I had a brain I've had two brain surgeries and I've had chemotherapy and every
*  time someone would say to me why why do you think God did this and and and they were well meant
*  and my answer was I don't think that God said well we could use some chemo I think rather that the
*  question of my life would be given that this happened what do you do with it how do you react
*  to it how do you feel about it and and I would just say very quickly that my working theory is
*  and it's not original with me is that when people say why do bad things happen to good people
*  imagine for a minute the good things happen to good people and I think that's the reason
*  people and bad things happen to bad people everybody would be good all the time because
*  who would be bad if you know every time you steal you're going to get a disease everyone would be
*  good all the time the only way it is possible to be good in this world is if you can be good
*  without knowing the consequences it has to be random or there's no goodness so you know you can
*  be the best person in the world and you can still die young but at least if you know that then your
*  goodness was real goodness you were doing it because you believe good is important or you
*  love other people or you or being good makes you feel good at something intrinsic and not because
*  you're being good because you know God's going to reward you so that's what I would say in a nutshell
*  next question wow what an answer a different subject your thoughts on the rise in anti-semitism
*  in large parts of western europe and college campuses and the intense feelings so many people
*  in the world have about israel many observers think that the anti-israel expressions is just a
*  cloak for anti-semitism so what I would say the quick answer to the to the to the very end of it
*  is not all anti-israel sentiment is anti-semitism but anti-israel sentiment is now the respectable
*  guise for anti-semitism very few p only the most fringy fringers will come up and say we'll stand
*  up and say i'm an anti-semite but you can say i'm anti-israel and be an anti-semite and that's a
*  respectable and and there are i think there are lots of tests that you can apply to the way people
*  criticize israel and the way they criticize other places that will let you know what's behind it
*  it's like the return of the repressed i think post holocaust it had to go underground in a deep way
*  for a while but now it has erupted again and there is some viral strain in well first it was
*  in european dna and now i'm afraid it's very much in world and not not in world dna i mean there was
*  already in islam again there were seeds of it but it wasn't the kind of fraternal fight that there
*  was increased or a paternal fight that there was in christianity and judaism but now it's taken over
*  lock stock and barrel and and the virulence on both sides in islam and in europe is truly frightening
*  it is truly frightening so i say you know the buddhists and hindus that's where we got these
*  days um i don't know it's a very look the one thing that i would say that is important to keep
*  in mind is it's not 1942 in throughout christian europe there are many many many millions the
*  overwhelming number of people are of goodwill the leaders of europe are overtly and for the most
*  part you know very covertly also opponents of anti-semitism in some very significant ways
*  but it's scary it is scary next question thank you i was going to ask whether it's natural for
*  jews maybe especially american jews to be conservatives or liberals but let's get more
*  up to date and pointed um is there something jewish about being alarmed or not about what's
*  perceived to be the trump agenda so here's what i would say about that and i think actually my
*  answer to both would be the same which is it is impossible to say let's let's i know a lot of
*  liberal jews who will say that judaism and democratic politics are virtually identical
*  and if they don't say it they feel it to which i always say look if the most learned and most
*  observant jews that is the orthodox community tends to be republican then it's a little
*  short-sighted to say obviously jewish values and democratic values are identical you can't say that
*  on the other hand you also can't say that the values of the prophets of amos and jeremiah
*  for the poor and the widowed and you know herman cohen said very beautifully in the idea of the
*  stranger judaism was born think about that today right that's what herman cohen said so i think
*  you can make a very powerful jewish case on both sides i don't want to address individuals at the
*  moment i think that that's not the purpose of the forum although if tyler asked me i will i will
*  but i think that i think that you can you can in good conscience be a jew on the right or on the
*  left and the only thing that i that i would say you ought to be uneasy in your conscience about
*  is if you believe that the other side has no good jewish values on its side because you're wrong
*  if i could just try a follow-up question given how many literally billions of people have been
*  elevated from poverty by what is mostly in my account capitalism not only capitalism
*  milton friedman saw this but still the weight of jewish intellectual opinion in the united states
*  has mostly been on the left i think that's a well-established regularity what's the
*  intellectual or sociological reason for that underlying well i'll say why that is and and then
*  one thing about capitalism that i think is profoundly jewish that most people don't realize
*  seriously i think the reason is because they came from east from eastern europe and that tradition
*  like the fdr tradition in america is is very i mean the only way that you could see out of the
*  morass of the the civilizations they were in was the only thing that gave them hope other than
*  zionism was a kind of bundes marxist socialist you know there wasn't really a living capitalist
*  alternative and it looked to to the very first glance it looked like the humanistic face of
*  economics as opposed to i mean what is capitalism competition well that doesn't look like a humanistic
*  face but the one thing that i will will tell you and i think i first heard this many years ago from
*  mentioned by george gilder i want to give him credit for this insight he said a real capitalist
*  has to have empathy because if you're building a business or a product and you don't know what
*  other people want you'll fail the only way you can succeed is if you actually understand what it is
*  that other people want and or need and both that combined with what you said which is that it is
*  the great engine of wealth that lifts people out of poverty i think that that a jewish thinker today
*  and many certainly many in israel would argue this too that you would have to be a capitalist
*  of some stripe i think it's very hard to make the case that certainly communism or even
*  socialism is the jewish although i could find you a few jewish socialists who would argue with me
*  we'll take the three last questions yes please yes rabbi thank you so much for sharing your evening
*  with us when this synagogue here was also the second home for odysseisrael when odysseisrael
*  left here in 1959 i believe conservative judaism was the top stream of judaism in the united states
*  in the decade or 15 years later conservative judaism lost over 600 000 members
*  could you tell us a little bit in your your own words so to speak why you think that happened
*  and what steps are being taken to recover that sort of that attraction that conservative judaism
*  once had for american jewelry thank you so sure but let me let me also add one more thing that
*  i was thinking about about the capitalism thing which is that capitalism also has the almost
*  inevitable byproduct of creating tremendous inequalities and and a jewish value has to a
*  jewish ethic has to address that as well it can't be a capitalism that ignores the fact that it
*  creates a an underclass that suffers so it has to be a capitalist has to be a you know a capitalist
*  socialism um anyway so not that i split differences as a pulpit rabbi but you're right too so
*  that's i don't know if you know that that's an old joke about the rabbi who has two people in front
*  of him and then they each make their case he goes you're right and then the second one makes the
*  case you're right and then his wife says dear they can't both be right it goes you're right too
*  so conservative judaism the the the dilemma that conservative judaism had was that it tried to
*  hold on to a serious jewish observance without conci with with modern scholarship that didn't
*  consistently say god told you you have to do this and modern jewish observance is a very hard thing
*  to hold on to and so people who had grown up with the traditional observance lived that out but as
*  as the motivational piece of it weakened so did that lifestyle that would maintain them as
*  conservative jews and unless and until not only conservative judaism by the way but liberal
*  religion in general unless and but the problem is worse in judaism because it makes greater demands
*  than other religions i mean christianity doesn't make such lifestyle demands
*  on christians as judaism does on jews unless and until there is a compelling non-fundamentalist
*  rationale for why i should eat a certain way and why i shouldn't go out on saturday in other words
*  the ritual behaviors that maintain the cohesion of the tradition until that is created and many
*  philosophers have tried to and many rabbis have tried until that's created conservative judaism
*  is going to face a huge uphill battle that's the short answer even if creation is eternal
*  this session is not the two last questions and answers will sum to seven minutes yes please
*  the united states supreme court is currently comprised only of catholics and jews do you think
*  that these groups naturally produce better jurors if so why and if not why is that the composition
*  of the court i i defer here to an answer that i heard given by my sociologist brother
*  at a at a session we did together in south africa last summer which is probably a sentence you've
*  never heard uttered before right i defer to my sociologist brother in a session we did together
*  in south africa because catholicism has a natural law tradition judaism has a strong legal tradition
*  and protestantism is antinomian it's anti-law that's that's the essence of protestantism
*  right so when you when you're looking for so who around here is trained in law the catholics and
*  the jews now that doesn't mean that there won't be individual protestants but if you're looking for
*  a deep tradition well we got one yes do you think it's uh realistic to talk about an american jewish
*  community or have we become too fractured to be considered a single community and if it is realistic
*  or possible then what is the biggest challenge facing the community okay is it are we a community
*  i have good news and bad news the good news is jews have never been united never only people who
*  think oh my god why don't we have the cohesion we used to our people who don't know jewish history
*  i used to be ex-communicating each other all the time the hasidim and the mignagdim and there was
*  always always always fights among jews and there are all sorts of jokes and things but it's true
*  it's true and by the i don't think this is unique to jews but it but it certainly is true among jews
*  the you can speak about an american jewish community that will mobilize around certain
*  moments of crisis and if god forbid there were a terrible moment of crisis i think most of the
*  american jewish community would mobilize around it if there was a huge wave of anti-semitism in
*  america for example um but having said that the the in some ways there there are look there in
*  jewish theology there are two ways of serving god there's yirah and ahabah there's fear and love
*  and fear in some in many ways is more immediately effective right i mean when you're
*  driving over the speed limit is it love for your fellow drivers or the presence of a police car
*  that will get you to slow down faster right fear is in some ways more immediate and effective than
*  love but love is more enduring because fear passes right but love real love even if creation
*  is not infinite real love endures right love in the words of shirash yrim the song of songs
*  is strong as death so if the american jewish community even if not holy because i'm not i'm
*  not a believer in universal love because then love is diluted it has no meaning right because
*  people that you love you'll sacrifice for and you can't sacrifice for everyone if the american
*  jewish community feels this familial sense and this sense of love and this sense of closeness
*  then we won't disappear and to some extent i'll close with the hasidic story to some extent i
*  feel like our story not entirely but a little bit it's like the story that that rabi chaim
*  halberstam used to tell of the man who was lost in the forest and he wandered and wandered and
*  and he was completely lost he had no idea where to go and he sat down in despair and as he sat down
*  another man comes along and he says oh i'm so glad to see you because i'm completely lost and the
*  second man says i have bad news for you i'm lost too he says but one thing i do know is the way we
*  have gone is not the way now let's hold hands and find the way together thank you
