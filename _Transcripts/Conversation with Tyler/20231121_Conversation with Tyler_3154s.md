Video Description: At the intersection of programming, economics, cryptography, distributed systems, information theory, and math, you will find Vitalik Buterin, who has managed to synthesize insights across those fields into successful, real-world applications like Ethereum, which aims to decentralize the Internet.

Tyler sat down with Vitalik to discuss the many things he's thinking about and working on, including the nascent field of cryptoeconomics, the best analogy for understanding the blockchain, his desire for more social science fiction, why belief in progress is our most useful delusion, best places to visit in time and space, how he picks up languages, why centralization's not all bad, the best ways to value crypto assets, whether P = NP, and much more.

Do you have a world-changing idea like Vitalik? The Mercatus Center is launching a new fellowship and grant program called Emergent Ventures to support transformational thinkers and doers.

# Vitalik Buterin on Cryptoeconomics and Markets in Everything | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ)
*  Hello, this is Tyler. Before we start, I just wanted to tell you about a new venture we're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  initiating at Mercatus. It's called Emergent Ventures. And the point of the venture is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=8.56s)]
*  to seek out ideas that have the potential to be transformational, including strange, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=13.66s)]
*  unusual, high-risk, high-return ideas, and to fund these ideas and to fund these people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  If you'd like to hear more about Emergent Ventures, well, we have a whole podcast on [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=24.96s)]
*  that. You can hear it on the Mercatus Policy Download, and you can find that in your favorite [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=29.4s)]
*  podcast app. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=34.4s)]
*  For more information on conversations, including videos, transcripts, and upcoming dates, visit [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=59.4s)]
*  conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Hello, I'm here today with Vitalik Buterin, who is founder and chief scientist at Ethereum. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=65.88s)]
*  I'd like to start with what I call the Vitalik Buterin production function. That is, how [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  you get things done. So I went back and I re-read all of the papers on your homepage, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=81.28s)]
*  And I found it quite striking that there are two very important economics results, one [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=86.4s)]
*  based on menu costs associated with the name of Greg Monkew, and others a paper on the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=90.56s)]
*  indeterminacy of monetary equilibrium associated with Fisher Black. These are famous papers. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=95.12s)]
*  On your own, you appear to rediscover these results without knowing about the papers at [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=100.64s)]
*  all. So how would you describe how you teach yourself economics? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=104.72s)]
*  I guess it involves a combination of things. Some of it is just reading what various economists [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=110.04s)]
*  on the internet say, some of it is reading papers. Sometimes if I want to dig into some [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  topic more deeply, I end up reading books. I read one on urban transportation economics [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  a while back. I also go to conferences, so I was just at the economics and computation [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  conference with Glenn Weil and other people in Ithaca last week, which I thought was very [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=134.52s)]
*  interesting. I think it's always a kind of indispensable opportunity to physically go [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=140.16s)]
*  to places and actually talk to people, because that way you learn things about both what [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=148.56s)]
*  people are thinking about and how people are thinking and the space that you can't easily [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=153.68s)]
*  find from the internet. And if you think about economics, what you've taught yourself, what do [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  you think of as the central ideas relevant for crypto economics, which is a term I think [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=162.12s)]
*  you coined? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, crypto economics, first of all, is economics, right? So it's not like we're inventing some [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  completely different parallel society with a different parallel economy and different [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=172.96s)]
*  rules, but it is economics specialized to a particular set of circumstances. And then [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=176.56s)]
*  you have to ask yourself, well, what describes those circumstances? And I think there is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=183.12s)]
*  a few major parts to that answer. So first of all, whatever mechanisms you have in crypto [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=187.64s)]
*  economics land have to be fully specified exactly and not exactly to the standards of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=194.32s)]
*  a court judge, but exactly to the standards of a computer programmer. And so what that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  means is that there's a lot of things that you can't do. So for example, you can't [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=204.16s)]
*  say in crypto economics, it's illegal to bribe people because there's really no simple [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  way to define what a bribe is. And if someone really wants to bribe someone else, well, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=214.16s)]
*  he can just go and do that outside of the protocol and the protocol would just have [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=218.56s)]
*  no way to tell. Right? So whatever your rules are for rewarding, penalizing inside of the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=222.04s)]
*  mechanism, they have to be basically specified as a piece of solidity code, viper code, whatever [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=228.12s)]
*  programming language you're using, and that's it. And that's a much tighter constraint [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=234.68s)]
*  than policymakers writing laws have. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=238.2s)]
*  Another one is of course that all of the actors are anonymous. And what that means in practice [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=241.96s)]
*  is basically that you cannot drag people's utility down below zero. Right? So if I have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=246.72s)]
*  70 ether, and I put that 70 ether into a mechanism, the worst thing you can do to me is you can [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  take away that 70 ether, you cannot throw me in jail, you cannot socially ostracize me [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=257.76s)]
*  so I can't earn any money again, because I can always just switch identities. But to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=262.56s)]
*  willing to lock that ether up and make it vulnerable to a mechanism, then you have the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=267.8s)]
*  ability to motivate me to that extent. So crypto economics is basically taking economics [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=273.08s)]
*  with those particular constraints, and then adding together insights from some kind of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=278.68s)]
*  fields that are fairly close by to the cryptocurrency space. So particularly cryptography and information [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=284.2s)]
*  theory and math and distributed systems. So including all of the research around consensus [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=291.16s)]
*  algorithms, hash functions, signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, and what we know about all of those [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=296.44s)]
*  primitives. And so basically trying to figure out, given these constraints and given these [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=301.04s)]
*  building blocks, what kind of systems and what kind of mechanisms can we design to achieve [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=307.12s)]
*  the properties that we want, and under what kinds of assumptions do those properties hold? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=313.52s)]
*  And what's the contribution or understanding you wish economics could give you that it [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=318.6s)]
*  hasn't given you yet? What problem do you want it to solve for you? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=322.68s)]
*  So once you start getting into the weeds, and you try to move beyond very simple things [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=326.28s)]
*  like proof of work and the simplest versions of proof of stake and the tricks that we've [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=333.96s)]
*  known about since 2009 or 2013, then you get into this situation where you realize that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=339.88s)]
*  basically the kinds of problems that you run into when you're trying to incentivize behavior. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=352.24s)]
*  So particularly when you run into things like what I call a speaker listener fault equivalence, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=356.92s)]
*  which is basically this idea that if the protocol requires Alice to send a message to Bob, and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=362.24s)]
*  the protocol detects that Bob never showed a message from Alice, then the protocol knows [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=367.72s)]
*  that either it's because Alice forgot to speak or it's because Bob pretended not to listen. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=372.16s)]
*  And then under those kinds of conditions trying to figure out what is the right way to motivate [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=377.72s)]
*  Alice and motivate Bob while preserving all sorts of different properties, then these [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=382.48s)]
*  are questions that are very close to questions that game theorists, mechanism designers, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  people in the economics community have already had a lot of things to say about. And there [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  definitely are results from the existing fields of economics and game theory that have helped [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=398.8s)]
*  significantly in that regard. Another whole aspect to this is also the kind of more broader [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=407.8s)]
*  and social question of how will blockchain based systems actually end up affecting society. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=412.64s)]
*  And like basically, what is a blockchain's unique competitive advantage? What are things [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=419.0s)]
*  that you can do with blockchains that you can do only with more difficulty without them? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=424.36s)]
*  And trying to like basically go from there and zero in and try to figure out exactly [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=430.36s)]
*  what industries and what kind of applications in those industries should be going after, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=437.08s)]
*  do the things that were the things at the application layer that we're trying to build [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  even make sense? Should we modify them in some way to have them make more sense? And [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=444.76s)]
*  I mean, I do think that people from the economics community have a lot to say about that, right? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=449.88s)]
*  So like I, even like Alex Tabarrok, for example, had that very nice post on marginal evolution [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=454.2s)]
*  a couple of weeks back where he talked about blockchains in terms of being an alternative [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=461.96s)]
*  to platform monopolies. And I thought that was a very good insight. And I thought that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=469.8s)]
*  basically the general idea that a blockchain is one of the few tools that allows you to basically [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=475.96s)]
*  credibly commit not turning into a monopolistic jerk is actually a really interesting insight. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=482.52s)]
*  And one that I've kind of arrived at myself, but it definitely helps to have it be crystallized [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=488.36s)]
*  in that way. If you had to explain blockchain to a very smart person from 40 years ago, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=493.88s)]
*  who knew computers but had no idea of crypto, what would be the best short explanation you [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=499.24s)]
*  could give them basically for what you do? So one of the analogies I keep going back to is [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=503.88s)]
*  this idea of a quote world computer. So the idea basically is that a blockchain as a whole functions [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=510.52000000000004s)]
*  like a computer. It has a hard drive. And on that hard drive, it stores what all the accounts are, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=517.48s)]
*  it stores what the code of all the smart contracts is, what the memory of all these smart contracts [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=523.72s)]
*  is. It accepts incoming instructions. And these incoming instructions are science transactions [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=528.52s)]
*  sent by a bunch of different users and processes them according to a set of rules. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=534.52s)]
*  And on a blockchain, you can ultimately build anything that you can build on top of a computer. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=539.08s)]
*  So from a computer science, a theoretic point of view in terms of what it provides, you can think [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=545.8s)]
*  about it as being a computer. But what it provides on top of that is these extra trust guarantees, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=550.04s)]
*  right? So the guarantee that the computer will run in the way that you expect it to run, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=555.4s)]
*  and that a few people can't make that guarantee fail by going out of business, getting hacked, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=560.52s)]
*  dying, having their company go bankrupt, deciding to be evil one day, deciding they have some [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=567.08s)]
*  monopolistic interests to start acting differently one day and all those different issues. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=573.4s)]
*  A reader wrote to me this question, quote, a crypto token is in some ways a shelling point [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=577.56s)]
*  achieved through charisma. Is that secretly what he's best at? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=582.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I did write that blog post a couple of months back where, and I think this might be one [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  of those things that you referred to where I talk about this and if signaling theory equal a realm [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=594.28s)]
*  of cryptocurrencies where I basically try to answer the question, well, if there isn't just [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=599.32s)]
*  going to be one cryptocurrency, then what prevents the entire cryptocurrency space from [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  hyperinflating as people can just costlessly issue more and more? And the answer that I came up with [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=608.5200000000001s)]
*  is basically that issuing a cryptocurrency by itself is costless, but issuing a cryptocurrency [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=613.72s)]
*  that people care about is not costless. And so the equilibrium is basically that there exists [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=619.32s)]
*  this kind of club of cryptocurrencies that people recognize as having value. And it is possible to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=624.36s)]
*  join the club, but joining the club basically requires that you undertake some kind of costly [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=631.72s)]
*  signaling expenditure. So basically in some ways, burn capital, burn resources, or consume [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=637.4s)]
*  something unique, which is just difficult enough that it prevents people from just doing it willy [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=642.68s)]
*  nilly to the point where all of cryptocurrency hyperinflates. Don't people trust ether and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=648.12s)]
*  ethereum in part because they trust you? And in a sense, there's this Russian tradition of kind [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=652.12s)]
*  of holy men who come along, Dostoevsky, Zaliosha, Prince Mishkin, like a non-evil Rasputin, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=658.2s)]
*  and the person is innocent and has some very wise message and people flock to that person. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=664.04s)]
*  Are you in a sense the contemporary version of those figures? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=669.0s)]
*  Matthew 18 I know people have different theories about the kind of influence that I myself have. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=672.04s)]
*  I think part of it is that at least I feel like the innovation in the crypto space isn't just [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=679.72s)]
*  technological innovation or political innovation, it's also to a large degree cultural innovation. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=688.5200000000001s)]
*  And even I with my own behavior, right, I end up talking to people at different conferences, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=694.0400000000001s)]
*  reply to random people's Reddit messages, try to make myself maximally accessible in a bunch of [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  ways, try to bring different people in different communities together, perform a kind of social [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=706.44s)]
*  coordination function, which is probably from an economist's point of view, similar to some aspects [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=713.0s)]
*  of management, but without the aspects of management that kind of evoke images of centralized [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=717.72s)]
*  control and all those different things. And that's not just myself, you know, that's the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=722.12s)]
*  Ethereum community, it's other cryptocurrency communities. And I do feel like there definitely [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=727.24s)]
*  is a real sense in which the crypto community is also at the epicenter of all of these different [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=732.04s)]
*  cultural ideas of like, how projects should organize what it means to be a leader, what it [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=738.68s)]
*  means to be a developer, what it means to be part of a project, what it means to be part of a team. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  And there is, there are social dimensions to that, there's ideological dimensions to that, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=749.7199999999999s)]
*  there's dimensions of like, how different ideas get spread and become more popular. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=756.92s)]
*  And I mean, I definitely do agree that that aspect of things is one that's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=763.0s)]
*  very important, probably not talked about enough. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=767.3199999999999s)]
*  – If we think of Thomas Schelling's notion of a focal point, something that people coordinate upon [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=769.9599999999999s)]
*  and come to accept as somehow centrally important, doesn't that mean centralization always reemerges? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=774.8399999999999s)]
*  You look at something like Twitter, we're both on Twitter. I don't think Twitter is dominant in its [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=780.92s)]
*  sphere because its AI is so good. It's just people know the name and people are used to going to Twitter. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=785.64s)]
*  And will the crypto space end up as centralized as Twitter, Google, and Facebook? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=790.12s)]
*  – So I wrote this blog post a couple years ago where I talk about different kinds of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=794.76s)]
*  decentralization. One I talk about is architectural decentralization, which is basically the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=799.16s)]
*  difference between a system being based on one computer and say a system being based on lots of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=804.6s)]
*  computers and being fault tolerant. And lots of things are actually decentralized already, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=810.12s)]
*  large parts of Amazon AWS, lots of military hardware, traditional airplanes, lots of things have [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=815.0s)]
*  aspects of architectural decentralization. Another one is political decentralization, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=821.16s)]
*  which is the thing, and blockchains are trying to achieve the architectural side of decentralization [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=826.44s)]
*  of it's not run on one piece of hardware. And political decentralization, it's not run by one [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=832.44s)]
*  single person or small cobalt people at the same time. The third kind of decentralization I talk [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=837.88s)]
*  about though is logical centralization versus decentralization. One example I gave in my post [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=843.16s)]
*  is kind of the English language, right? The English language is architecturally decentralized [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=848.36s)]
*  because there's no one single dictionary. It's politically decentralized. There's no one who [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=853.0s)]
*  really has the ability to practically regulate new words into and out of existence. But it is [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=857.16s)]
*  logically centralized in the sense of there is one thing which is the English language. And if you [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=863.0s)]
*  start deviating from that one thing, then you're going to have a harder time. And the conclusion [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=867.88s)]
*  of my post is basically, or at least part of it, is that I do think that blockchains are logically [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=873.24s)]
*  centralized. And like basically because there is one blockchain, it is a shared ledger, it is a [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=879.0s)]
*  canonical history, you're either part of it or you're not. And I argue that this logical [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=884.76s)]
*  centralization is actually good. If you're looking to hire someone either for Ethereum or to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=889.5600000000001s)]
*  collaborate with, what quality or qualities do you look for that may be other people under eight? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=894.12s)]
*  Because you've also built a successful company, right? You're not just chief scientist. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=899.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, and company is not even necessarily the right emphasis once again, right? It goes [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=903.08s)]
*  back to my point about cultural innovation. Ultimately, there are different kind of circles [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=907.5600000000001s)]
*  in the Ethereum community, some overlapping, some nod. And there is different ideas of what it means [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=915.88s)]
*  to be Ethereum. So for example, you could be a full time employee of the organization based in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=921.0s)]
*  Switzerland called the Ethereum Foundation, or it's outpost in Singapore called Ethereum Asia [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=926.84s)]
*  Pacific Limited. You could be someone who has received a grant from the Ethereum Foundation. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=932.04s)]
*  You could also be basically a groupie, someone that has intellectual ideas, likes hanging out [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=938.68s)]
*  with us and just happens to fly around everywhere to the same cities that we're in. And you could [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=944.04s)]
*  be someone working on some Ethereum project. And there's definitely people who work outside of the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=948.76s)]
*  Ethereum Foundation as a formal organization that are that have made much bigger contributions [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=956.2s)]
*  than even some people inside of the foundation. I think that's part of where a lot of the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=961.72s)]
*  successful innovation has come from. And one of the things that this gives you is it basically [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=969.08s)]
*  means that there are many different ways to be an Ethereum, right? Like you can either follow along [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=973.32s)]
*  and have the same kind of lifestyle that I do, or you can work for some traditional company and have [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=979.8000000000001s)]
*  some Ethereum Foundation grants be one of your projects. You could work on some Ethereum [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=985.32s)]
*  application and be adjacent, you could just be a lone wolf working at home, you could [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  pick any linear combination of these that you want. And so there's trade offs, like basically you can [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=995.32s)]
*  be part of Ethereum while being part of a structured team, you can be part of it being a lone wolf, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1000.7600000000001s)]
*  you can be part of it as part of some traditional large corporation, you can be part of a startup. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1005.08s)]
*  And I do feel like this is part of what makes cryptocurrency is interesting, right? In that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1010.92s)]
*  they are not just a decentralized censorship resistance, whatever system as a product, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1017.96s)]
*  but they are also this cultural evolution that itself incorporates many aspects of decentralization [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1024.68s)]
*  in terms of how they're produced and in terms of a way of living and collaborating and building [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1032.3600000000001s)]
*  things. Now while building Ethereum, you've also taught yourself French, German, and Chinese [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1037.4s)]
*  without having lived in those countries. On YouTube, I've even seen you answering questions [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1042.52s)]
*  in Chinese about the blockchain to a Chinese audience. So how did you teach yourself such [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1047.3200000000002s)]
*  good Chinese? First of all, like as I said on Reddit, I definitely did not learn Chinese and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1051.72s)]
*  especially not Cantonese in three months on a mobile app. Like that's stuff that like people [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1057.72s)]
*  people come up with about me. And like, I don't know, I don't like it because it makes me look [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1063.08s)]
*  more like Kim Il Sung and it doesn't make me look like a real person. Not to say Kim Il Sung is not [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1068.4399999999998s)]
*  a real person, but like Kim Il Sung, the demigod definitely isn't. What actually happened was that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1072.9199999999998s)]
*  basically around 2013, I just decided, hey, cool, the Bitcoin community in China looks like it's [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1080.1999999999998s)]
*  really big and really interesting. And there's this big world that I haven't really been connected to [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1085.6399999999999s)]
*  and maybe I should try. So I started going through PIMS over podcasts initially. And once I went [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1090.2s)]
*  through those, then I went through some other learned Chinese podcasts. In parallel to that, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1095.96s)]
*  I also did started going through flashcard apps that taught me the most popular, maybe like 500,000 [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1101.16s)]
*  characters and words. And then once you get to an intermediate level, you're basically [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  high enough that you can participate in WeChat conversations, go to China and participate in [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1112.44s)]
*  conversations in person. I mean, I was never a long term resident of China, but realistically, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1117.16s)]
*  I did spend more than half a year there in total in my life. And once you get to that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1121.72s)]
*  intermediate level, like basically, as long as you put yourself in environments where you just [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1127.48s)]
*  continue keeping it up, eventually, it just continues getting better and better. And eventually, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1133.24s)]
*  you get to the point where you can improve it further by watching movies on airplanes. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1137.48s)]
*  My colleague Robin Hansen has promoted the idea of prediction markets or betting on ideas. Why are [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1141.64s)]
*  there right now so few prediction markets? You can bet on the outcome of an election, there's plenty [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1147.0s)]
*  of sports betting, but they seem quite thin when it comes to sort of actual economic events. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1151.64s)]
*  So I know that on the centralized kind of traditional prediction market side, there's a [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1156.36s)]
*  lot of regulatory issues that make it more difficult to set one up. Also, even on top of that, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1161.56s)]
*  I think part of what makes cryptocurrency so attractive is that traditional financial systems [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1167.16s)]
*  have a lot of inefficiencies and annoyingness that go beyond the strict regulatory. Even [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1171.88s)]
*  something like, oh, I have money, how do I move it into some particular application? Very often, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1179.4s)]
*  it involves bank wires, it involves all of these various systems, which each individual person may [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1185.96s)]
*  or may not have, you have to figure it out, and there's a lot of friction involved. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1191.56s)]
*  And I kind of see cryptocurrency in part as this grand experiment of, well, what happens if you [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1195.1599999999999s)]
*  create a financial system that really is fully frictionless, where moving Bitcoin or Ether from [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1201.96s)]
*  your wallet into an application, into a smart contract or whatever, really is as simple as [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  logging into a website or clicking an email. And I do think that even already the cryptocurrency [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1214.04s)]
*  ecosystem has managed to do, first of all, it's managed to get people to accept micro payments [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1220.36s)]
*  for and specifically paying for transaction fees, when a lot of people thought that that's [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1226.6799999999998s)]
*  impossible. And I do have hopes that kind of the higher levels of, I guess, liquidity and efficiency [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1230.76s)]
*  in the cryptocurrency space could make cryptocurrency prediction markets succeed more. So that's one [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1237.6399999999999s)]
*  aspect. Another aspect is that even taking in, if the cryptocurrency-based solutions actually [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1243.08s)]
*  manage to be censorship resistant, and if they manage to be more convenient, then there is the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  possibility that this kind of gambling or betting or whatever just is a kind of betting that people [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1259.48s)]
*  just aren't as interested in. And basically, the amateurs don't find it interesting enough, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1266.04s)]
*  and there's not enough people playing for it to be worth the professionals to really participate. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1271.56s)]
*  And that is possible, though I guess I don't really think it's fair to say that prediction [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1278.44s)]
*  markets as a category can be really called a failed experiment yet, given that there have only [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1284.9199999999998s)]
*  been a few years of trying to make them work in only a couple of different approaches. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1290.6799999999998s)]
*  But if the agro and gnosis and all of these other Ethereum and blockchain-based prediction [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1298.2s)]
*  markets end up launching and it continues to be the case that lots of people don't end up using [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1305.64s)]
*  them, then it's probably more reasonable to consider that idea as kind of at least a failure in [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1310.2s)]
*  its dream of growing beyond the niche. But I don't think we're quite there yet. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1317.4s)]
*  As for frictionless trading, let's take what's called the oracle problem. So as you well know, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1321.48s)]
*  you can have smart contracts on Ethereum, but those are closest to frictionless when everything [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1326.28s)]
*  is within the system. But if you have an external event, a property title, and you need someone in [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1331.96s)]
*  the physical real world to rule how an actual piece of property is assigned to someone and how [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1336.76s)]
*  that information is then translated into cyberspace, does the oracle problem mean that the frictionless [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1341.8799999999999s)]
*  trading of, say, Ethereum is never actually that scalable, or is there some way around it that we [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1347.8s)]
*  don't yet see? It depends what specific thing you're trying to do frictionlessly. So for example, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1352.92s)]
*  moving ether from one accounts to another is absolutely frictionless. Now converting ether [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1357.88s)]
*  into fiat currency is absolutely not frictionless. And it is very possible that it's not going to [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1362.8400000000001s)]
*  significantly get more frictionless in the near medium term future, basically, because of all of [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1367.72s)]
*  the banking issues where cryptocurrency exchanges have a hard time getting and maintaining bank [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1373.64s)]
*  accounts. If you're talking about participating in some kind of pure financial derivative system, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1378.76s)]
*  then I think it will be frictionless. And- But determining how and or why someone should be [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1385.08s)]
*  paid. Someone has to rule that, right? Well, okay. So here's one example, right? So there's a system [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1389.32s)]
*  called MakerDAO, which is basically a decentralized currency that has a more active monetary policy [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1393.64s)]
*  that attempts to keep its price as close as possible to $1. And this clearly requires a price [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1400.28s)]
*  feed. And the MakerDAO definitely includes a decentralized price feed mechanism. And it [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1407.08s)]
*  definitely is the case that there is some overhead in maintaining that that Oracle inside of the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1413.32s)]
*  MakerDAO system. But at the same time, just using MakerDAO is completely frictionless, right? Like [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1417.72s)]
*  if I have ether, I can convert it into die very quickly, I can open up collateralized debt [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1424.04s)]
*  positions, I can do all the different things inside of the MakerDAO system all from just inside of [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1428.6799999999998s)]
*  one wallet. So basically, even especially in those cases where the data is data which is fairly [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1433.88s)]
*  publicly accessible and fairly easy to get at and fairly easy to verify, at least as a person, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1443.72s)]
*  I don't think that those issues are going to be that large. Now, once you get into issues like, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1450.6000000000001s)]
*  oh, me and you are going to enter into a smart contract, where it's say it's like fire insurance, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  where if your house burns down, then I have to pay you some amount to cover the cost. And if [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1463.0s)]
*  nothing happens, you pay me $500, then that suddenly becomes a lot harder, because then the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1467.48s)]
*  cost of getting the information actually is very high. And it's very specific to one transaction. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1472.92s)]
*  And I don't really expect smart contracts by themselves to solve the problem. Now, what could [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1478.44s)]
*  happen, of course, is you could try to come up with mechanisms that basically build in who the [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1484.6s)]
*  arbitrators are. Right? So you could imagine some system where say, you have a village and people [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1489.72s)]
*  in the village all put some amount of money into a smart contract. And if people vote and agree that [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1495.5600000000002s)]
*  one particular person is in need of cash, then they vote and they vote and he gets the cash. So [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1500.5200000000002s)]
*  that sort of thing is potentially completely doable. And I do kind of hope to see it. And [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1505.5600000000002s)]
*  I know we are starting to see people trying to design applications like that. But it's definitely [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1510.6000000000001s)]
*  not the same thing as some magic oracle that absolutely knows everything. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1515.16s)]
*  Has Ethereum and perhaps other groups moved from proof of work to proof of stake, or some kind of [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1520.3600000000001s)]
*  intermediate weighted average solution? To what extent will this require more institutional trust [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1525.96s)]
*  in Ethereum or the other intermediaries? And will that be centralizing? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1532.1200000000001s)]
*  So I would actually expect that on net, it would require less institutional trust. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1536.3600000000001s)]
*  And like part of this is basically just because a lot of people don't realize the sheer level of [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1542.36s)]
*  centralization in proof of work already, right? Like in Bitcoin, basically, there is one person, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1546.84s)]
*  Jihan Wu, who basically controls the largest two mining pools in Bitcoin that add up to 42% of the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1552.4399999999998s)]
*  network. And 42% isn't enough to do a 51% attack, but it is enough to do selfish mining, which is [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1557.9599999999998s)]
*  enough to, like, basically reduce other people's profits to the point where they drop out and you [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1563.8s)]
*  can do a 51% attack. And granted, like, these are pools, but a very large portion of that 42%, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1567.88s)]
*  I believe, actually is his own hardware, right? So basically, I think, because we're kind of used [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1574.44s)]
*  to it, people do underestimate the kind of oligopoly and the rich get richer and the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1580.44s)]
*  trust that's necessary inside of proof of work systems already. So for example, like, we, like [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1587.0800000000002s)]
*  Bitcoin users already basically trust Jihan Wu and Wang Chuan to not team up and start doing a [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1593.56s)]
*  51% attacks pretty much every day. And, you know, they seem to be nice enough or at least [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1600.92s)]
*  rationally self-interested enough not to do that, but that's definitely still institutional trust. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1607.8s)]
*  What's the biggest tech or engineering breakthrough you feel you need to realize the full vision [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1612.2s)]
*  that you started with? I think scalability is a huge one. Ethereum blockchain's capacity right now [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1616.84s)]
*  is about 15 transactions a second. And if you even consider something like putting all of the [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1622.6s)]
*  Uber rides on the blockchain, well, that's 12 transactions per second already. And if you [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1627.1599999999999s)]
*  talk about moving PayPal over, that gets into the hundreds and then anything more complex [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1631.6399999999999s)]
*  starts moving into the many thousands. So I do feel like just raw ability to process more [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1635.8s)]
*  transactions per second is important. And that could happen through sharding and other base layer [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1641.56s)]
*  scalability upgrades to the system, which we are working on. It could happen through layer two [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1647.1599999999999s)]
*  technologies like state channels and plasma, which we are also working on. And but as basically, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1651.96s)]
*  if any of these approaches end up succeeding, then I do think that blockchains will end up being [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1657.48s)]
*  substantially cheaper and substantially more ready for actual mainstream use. Another big one is user [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1664.52s)]
*  experience and both user experience in terms of using the blockchain not being as clunky as it is [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1670.44s)]
*  today, but also user experience of security. So basically, how easy is it to set up a wallet [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1676.44s)]
*  that does not allow all of your money to get stolen overnight or lost overnight if your key [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1683.3200000000002s)]
*  gets lost or stolen. And those are challenges that I do think we need a lot more innovation in. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1687.56s)]
*  And I think we will see innovation over the next few years. What change in the legal or regulatory [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  environment would help the most to realize this vision? I am actually don't really think that [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1696.8400000000001s)]
*  there are many legal or regulatory kind of changes that can help, at least on the technological [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1705.4s)]
*  development side. Basically, because like ultimately, you know, the US already has already [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1711.5600000000002s)]
*  has all of these like CODIS free speech precedents and like most other countries, even those without [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1717.3200000000002s)]
*  significant free speech protection still are still willing to kind of follow along in principle. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1724.2800000000002s)]
*  So I think for development in tech, the environment is very close to us friendly as it can be. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1729.8000000000002s)]
*  Then the next question is, of course, the question of what happens when the tech is built and you [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1735.5600000000002s)]
*  start talking about actual wider deployment and adoption. In that case, it depends on what kind [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1741.64s)]
*  of adoption of what application you're looking for. Like I feel like a lot of the drive toward [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1747.24s)]
*  regulatory friendliness so far has been on the cryptocurrency exchange side. But like cryptocurrency [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1752.2s)]
*  is really only one of the things that you can do, right? And trying to make it easier for like [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1758.84s)]
*  very large piles of money to move into the cryptocurrency space is I don't necessarily [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1765.48s)]
*  think the thing that that the cryptocurrency space needs most at this point. And like honestly, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1769.3999999999999s)]
*  especially when you hear things about like CEOs of exchanges trying to move into in like Africa, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1774.6799999999998s)]
*  where the levels of financial literacy are very low, and there's all sorts of Ponzi schemes already [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1781.8799999999999s)]
*  and then institutional like institutional investors and pension funds and so forth trying [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1786.36s)]
*  to get into cryptocurrency, like there's definitely reasons to believe that stuff can be actively [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1790.9199999999998s)]
*  counterproductive. So I think for other kinds of applications, it's a very application specific [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1795.56s)]
*  question, right? So like, for example, if you look at ICOs, and then I've come up with, you know, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1803.0s)]
*  like DA ICOs, and then you can also talk about like airdrops and like decentralized product [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1808.28s)]
*  launches and all of these ideas, which are basically innovations in fundraising, then [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1813.64s)]
*  like that basically requires a regulatory environment, which is open to experimentation. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1821.0s)]
*  That's something that I do think that places in Asia tend to be fairly ahead of the curve on in [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1826.52s)]
*  terms of like sandboxes in Singapore. I know Hong Kong and Taiwan are looking into sandboxes as well. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1832.04s)]
*  Whereas I don't it doesn't seem like the US has quite quite that kind of approach, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  at least at this point in time, right? It's possible the political environment is just kind [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1847.16s)]
*  of not organized enough to maintain it. And there's bigger priorities to worry about at this point. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1851.88s)]
*  What's the best theory out there for valuing a given crypto asset? It doesn't have to be either, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1856.6s)]
*  but there's a new crypto asset that comes along. Let's say it's cleared some minimum threshold of [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1861.16s)]
*  interest. What theoretical apparatus from economics or elsewhere should we apply? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1865.48s)]
*  So I've thought about this a lot, and I'm still not sure what the kind of best answer is, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1869.96s)]
*  because ultimately, it depends a lot on kind of the way the cryptocurrency goes. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1874.92s)]
*  So one way to measure this is to treat a cryptocurrency as basically being a kind [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1878.84s)]
*  of corporation that collects revenue through transaction fees. And particularly in the case [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1884.76s)]
*  where transaction the transaction fees either are burned or get redistributed to the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1891.0s)]
*  proof of the cryptocurrencies own mistake validators. In that case, you can basically [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1895.64s)]
*  take the simple model and say, Oh, a cryptocurrency is valuation is the net present value of the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1899.88s)]
*  transaction fees that it's getting. And now this by itself surprisingly does give like fairly [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1904.84s)]
*  decent valuation. So for example, Ethereum transaction fees tend to be about $500,000 a [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1911.0s)]
*  day recently, which is about $180 million a year. So if you try to kind of value the ether market [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1916.76s)]
*  cap as some kind of corporation, then the kind of quote PE ratio is only somewhere in the low [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1924.6s)]
*  200s, which is, you know, high for a company, but not like, but not off the charts absurdly high. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1929.8799999999999s)]
*  Then you can also look at trying to value cryptocurrencies in their capacity as a [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1937.4s)]
*  medium is of exchange. And then you have, you know, MV equals PT and all of these other models. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1942.36s)]
*  And then there's also this model of store value where basically people hold it because they expect [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1947.3999999999999s)]
*  more people to hold it in the future. And because people keep getting richer and the population [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1952.2s)]
*  keeps growing, as long as prices grow slow enough, it can be stable in the long term. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1956.84s)]
*  I expect and there are a lot of people that are really pushing the store value angle. I guess my [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1961.6399999999999s)]
*  practical answer is I don't really know. And if you're looking to design a cryptocurrency that's [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1967.72s)]
*  sustainable, then I definitely think it's important to have a story for why it would maintain its value [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1974.84s)]
*  under a variety of different economic models. What do you think of the portfolio competition [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1979.56s)]
*  with gold theory? So if you measure the total stock of gold out there, and then you conclude, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1983.88s)]
*  don't ask me how well, people will want to shift 5% of that into crypto assets. And you figure out [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1988.2s)]
*  the value of that, and you then get an aggregate figure, not for any particular asset, but for [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1993.8s)]
*  crypto as a whole. Does that make sense to you? Or do you think that's a lot of fallacy? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=1998.44s)]
*  No, that's definitely something that I've considered as well. And that's [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2002.04s)]
*  part of what I mean when I talk about the store value model, right? Like basically, I think, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2005.3999999999999s)]
*  even if cryptocurrencies by themselves do nothing, it's you can, like if there's an established [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2010.2s)]
*  equilibrium where they roughly grow at, you know, the same or similar rate as other things, then [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2015.3999999999999s)]
*  you could have a situation, as long as they grow in a way that's at least somewhat uncorrelated [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2020.84s)]
*  from other things, that it makes sense for impure portfolio theory to have some of your money in [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2024.6s)]
*  them. I definitely fully agree with that position. Like as you said, I reinvented it myself. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2029.16s)]
*  In most of these sessions, we have a segment in the middle called overrated versus underrated. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2033.56s)]
*  Are you game for doing this? Advertising, overrated or underrated? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2037.96s)]
*  Probably, I'm going to guess my answer to a lot of these is going to be [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2042.6s)]
*  correctly, roughly correctly rated, but in a different way from how other people expect. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2047.3999999999999s)]
*  So like, for example, I think advertising in terms of traditional advertising, definitely overrated, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2052.2799999999997s)]
*  but advertising in terms of the broader category of trying to influence how people in the public [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2058.68s)]
*  think in order to benefit your product, I think we're going to see lots of innovation, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2067.0s)]
*  you know, like both good and bad in term over the next couple of decades. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2071.88s)]
*  Travel as a method of learning? Definitely, I would say still underrated. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2075.56s)]
*  And what's the thing one gets from travel that a lot of other people don't grasp? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2081.08s)]
*  First of all, it depends what kind of travel. So like I think like going to Beijing and seeing [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2085.0s)]
*  the summer palace and then going to Tokyo and seeing some shrine and whatever is like basically [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2089.88s)]
*  useless because you don't really get more than you would get by going to Wikipedia. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2097.96s)]
*  But I think the kind of traveling that is valuable is the kind where like it's not even [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2102.04s)]
*  set up as explicit sort of travel for the sake of travel, you're traveling there in order to do [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2107.72s)]
*  something. And in the course of doing that, you end up interacting with people, you end up seeing [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2113.48s)]
*  what the different aspects of the culture look like, you end up seeing like how people think, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2118.84s)]
*  how people interact with each other. Is there something that they're doing that's better than [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2122.92s)]
*  what you're used to as other things are doing that you can really say are worse than what you're used [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2126.84s)]
*  to? I would say, and I personally definitely learned a lot of that from say going to China [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2130.84s)]
*  that I would not have learned, and Asia in general, that I would not have learned by [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2136.36s)]
*  just reading about those places from the internet and the various mainstream ideological [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2140.84s)]
*  blabhouses that talk about those places all day long. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2148.28s)]
*  And what's your favorite part of China to visit? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2150.6800000000003s)]
*  As far as cities go, I like Shanghai. I have mixed feelings about Shenzhen. There's definitely [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2153.16s)]
*  innovativeness, but then there's definitely also all of this kind of like let's make 500 shopping [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2162.8399999999997s)]
*  malls culture. To me, it's boring Shenzhen. I prefer almost anywhere else in China. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2168.6s)]
*  Right, right. I would say Beijing is kind of growing more on me over time, I guess. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2172.36s)]
*  I mean, it's obviously on the periphery of China, but Hong Kong is interestingly all in its own [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2181.64s)]
*  right as well. How about Zug, Switzerland? Forget about crypto, just as a city, underrated or [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2186.76s)]
*  overrated? Depends for what purpose. So for example, I used to spend a lot of time in Zug, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2191.7200000000003s)]
*  but now I spend much less time. And part of that is that I do think it's overrated as a place to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2198.76s)]
*  live. And basically, I think the problem is that there is this broader kind of subculture of people [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2204.7599999999998s)]
*  trying to make basically libertarian tax havens of different levels of extremeness. And I think one [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2215.48s)]
*  of the problems of libertarian tax havens and libertarian havens in general, both online and [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2221.8799999999997s)]
*  offline, is that they attract both people who like freedom and rich people who are not particularly [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2227.96s)]
*  interesting. And in Zug, basically, you just have a very small number of people. It's relatively [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2234.36s)]
*  difficult to get to, a lot of people in the finance industry. And it just doesn't have the sort of [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2242.36s)]
*  things that attract me about cities that would make me want to live there. And on top of that, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2248.44s)]
*  you have to pay $5.50 to buy anything in Starbucks. And even places like, there's people [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2253.7200000000003s)]
*  trying to make a kind of Crypto Valley in Puerto Rico, and I'm starting to worry it's running into [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2262.52s)]
*  that kind of effect as well. In terms of places to kind of just set up a crypto project, I think, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2267.48s)]
*  could be totally legit. The Disney Star Wars movies. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2273.64s)]
*  The most recent one, episode eight, is underrated. I would say the thing that I liked about episode [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2278.2s)]
*  eight is that it seems to have a certain kind of realism that was lacking in some of the previous [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2284.6s)]
*  ones. And what I mean by that is that it's not just glorious rebels versus the evil empire, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2291.64s)]
*  first order, whatever. First of all, for most of the movie, the rebels are losing. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2296.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's how conflicts work in real life. And second of all, it shows the enemy as something [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2300.8399999999997s)]
*  that's kind of a bit richer and even having its own internal conflicts. And to not knock some evil [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2307.0s)]
*  Borg where every member of the evil Borg agrees that they're the evil Borg and they need to fight [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2312.12s)]
*  for the collective good of the evil Borg. I feel like one of the ways in which all of these [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2316.04s)]
*  kind of modern epic myths mislead me when I was much younger is they do make it look like [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2322.2799999999997s)]
*  the world basically is just a bunch of good guys fighting against the evil orcs, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2327.24s)]
*  Sauron, empire, or whatever. And I'd be more interested in seeing kind of social science [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2331.8s)]
*  fiction. So like basically like science fiction or fantasy or whatever that explores also all [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2338.84s)]
*  of these kind of complex ideas about how people can interact and kind of how political systems [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2346.1200000000003s)]
*  can work, how economic systems can work, how they can fail, and particularly how they can fail in [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2352.28s)]
*  ways to create interesting stories without anyone being literally Hitler. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2359.48s)]
*  If you could go back into the distant past for a year, a time and place of your choosing, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  you have the linguistic skills and immunity against disease to the extent you need it, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2368.2799999999997s)]
*  maybe some money in your pocket. Where would you pick to satisfy your own curiosity? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2372.44s)]
*  Where would I pick to do what, to spend a year there? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2377.3199999999997s)]
*  Spend a year as a quote unquote tourist. You could pick ancient Athens or pre-conquest Mexico or [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2380.3599999999997s)]
*  medieval Russia. It's a kind of social science fiction, right? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2386.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, totally. I feel like, let's see, first possibly first year of World War II in one, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2391.16s)]
*  obviously one of those areas that's close to it but still reasonably safe from it. Possibly [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2398.7599999999998s)]
*  sometime in the night, in some period of kind of political upheaval, revolution, whatever, like in [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2406.68s)]
*  the, like basically in the time before this kind of great stagnation, this kind of great, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2417.6400000000003s)]
*  not quite stagnation but great moderation of pretty much everything. Like basically, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2425.32s)]
*  you kind of experience more what human behavior or what collective human behavior would look like [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2430.52s)]
*  once you push humans further into extremes and people aren't as comfortable as they are today. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2435.88s)]
*  What kind of social delusion or irrationality do you think should be more prevalent? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2440.84s)]
*  That's a very interesting one. In modern times, possibly a belief in progress. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2447.32s)]
*  And you think more people should believe in that even though it may not be true? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2454.28s)]
*  Even though it's true in complicated ways, well it's true sometimes in complicated ways and parts [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2457.88s)]
*  of it are definitely false in a bunch of situations. Is there a word in Russian you use when you think [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2465.0s)]
*  or talk that is no obvious English equivalent? I don't think so. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2471.16s)]
*  So you pretty much think mainly in English at this point. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2476.7599999999998s)]
*  I'd say so. Yeah. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2479.24s)]
*  The geography of tech innovation. So many things are crowded into San Francisco, Silicon Valley, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2480.52s)]
*  rents are very high, crypto has not really been the same. But what do you think the geography [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2485.48s)]
*  of tech innovation will look like 20 or 30 years from now? So first of all, I think that like it's [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2490.36s)]
*  definitely not possible for it to concentrate more basically just because the rents are too damn [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2496.84s)]
*  high. And as I've been led to understand one of the latest attempts to make sure more actual supply [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2501.8s)]
*  of living space can get built in California recently got shut down. So basically if rents [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2510.36s)]
*  continue being too damn high, then even like, it's just a matter of basic economics and math [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2516.36s)]
*  that the majority of developers are going to live in places other than the big centers. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2522.36s)]
*  And I think as technology in terms of ability to communicate remotely improves, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2527.1600000000003s)]
*  it seems to only make more sense that the premium from being inside of a center is going to reduce [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2534.2000000000003s)]
*  to some extent over time. So I would definitely say that more geographically distributed, at least [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2539.88s)]
*  in those kinds of industries that aren't physically capital intensive and that are more [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2548.04s)]
*  sort of lone wolf friendly is going to happen. Even in the crypto space, which is very lone [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2556.36s)]
*  wolf friendly, I think it's extremely geographically distributed already. Then there's another [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2560.44s)]
*  question of how do you measure technological innovation? Because there's a lot of metrics [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2565.8s)]
*  under which the US is really great, China is really great, but Europe is completely not even [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2570.2s)]
*  on the charts. But those metrics tends to be fairly kind of big money oriented. And if you look at [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2574.36s)]
*  broader innovation, people doing interesting stuff and plenty of things happen in Europe as well. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2580.6800000000003s)]
*  And you're from Europe? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2584.92s)]
*  Well, and Russia, the Eastern edge of Europe, sure. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2586.1200000000003s)]
*  How will quantum computing matter if at all for crypto assets? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2590.04s)]
*  Oh, it absolutely matters. Basically because quantum computing will make a lot of cryptography [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2593.48s)]
*  that's used in modern times just not work anymore. So digital signature algorithms won't work anymore. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2599.72s)]
*  Public key encryption won't work anymore. Now, the good news is zero knowledge proofs, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2606.68s)]
*  snarks won't work anymore. The good news is that for everything that doesn't work anymore, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2611.08s)]
*  people have already come up with replacements for the over a decade ago. And so, you know, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2615.3199999999997s)]
*  you have hash based signatures, you have Starks, for zero knowledge proofs, you have [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2620.3599999999997s)]
*  fancy elliptic curve, I saw Jenny based public key encryption. So I think it will force a transition. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2626.2799999999997s)]
*  But like, ultimately, we do know how to adapt. And basically, the cryptocurrencies that will suffer [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2632.04s)]
*  the most are just the ones whose governance is the most kind of stalled and dysfunctional and [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2638.4399999999996s)]
*  will be able to figure anything out in time. Is P equal to NP? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2643.3999999999996s)]
*  I would bet 90% no. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2647.16s)]
*  That's my guess as well. Is backward time travel possible? And if so, is that also a problem of [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2650.2799999999997s)]
*  computation? If someone goes back in time and they see Hamlet, and they capture Hamlet? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2655.72s)]
*  So I definitely don't believe in the theory that says you can go back in time. But like, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2662.3599999999997s)]
*  somehow, the the forces of fate basically ensure that whatever you cause to happen ends up turning [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2667.48s)]
*  into whatever is the modern world. Because that just seems very, it just seems computation [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2673.72s)]
*  theoretically incredibly implausible to like, it just requires it would require some kind of [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2678.52s)]
*  conscious God that keeps on like pushing the consequences of people's actions so that into [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2682.84s)]
*  so that they end up not having an effect. So if you what that means is that if you do travel back [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2688.6800000000003s)]
*  in time, you basically what you're really doing is you're traveling diagonally back in time into a [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2693.08s)]
*  different universe. And is that possible? I don't know. If I was like, if you put a gun to my head [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2697.48s)]
*  and force me to give a binary answer, I'd say no, but the answer could totally be yes. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2707.6400000000003s)]
*  The fees of the financial sector seems stuck at around 2% of GDP for a remarkably long period of [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2712.2s)]
*  time. And this is across an era where many other costs, even in percentage terms have come down. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2718.44s)]
*  Why do you think there's this stickiness with financial fees? And where's the first place where [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2724.44s)]
*  those fees will start to give in your vision of the future? So it could be that these are kind of [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2729.48s)]
*  constants that have to do with rent extraction rather than with the any particular features of [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2734.6s)]
*  the technology. Right. So for example, when I was at this economics and computation conference in [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2739.64s)]
*  Ithaca, there was this presentation on high frequency trading. And one of the things that [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2745.08s)]
*  was mentioned in this presentation is that how even though between the year 2000 and now, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2752.04s)]
*  the ability, like basically the the rate at which kind of disequilibria between different markets [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2758.12s)]
*  and between different assets that should have the same price kind of snap back into position, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2765.3199999999997s)]
*  even though that time has decreased from something like one second to something like 50 milliseconds, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2769.64s)]
*  the rate of profit that these HFT firms have been making has stayed pretty much constant. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2774.84s)]
*  And he came up with this economic model that basically said, if you look at what a market, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2780.36s)]
*  how a market works, and you come up with a model that basically says, oh, it's not actually about [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2786.44s)]
*  the absolute speed of the market. It's about basically what are not the kind of arms race [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2792.7599999999998s)]
*  between trying to cancel orders as they become irrelevant and trying to snap up other people's [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2798.76s)]
*  orders that that that are now mispriced, then you get this results that the rate of rent extraction, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2803.7200000000003s)]
*  the rate of profit, the rate of social loss, basically totally does not depend on the [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2810.44s)]
*  the actual absolute levels of technology and absolute levels of speed. So I think like, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2816.92s)]
*  if there is some dimension to finance, which is some kind of zero sum conflict, then that's, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2823.2400000000002s)]
*  that seems very plausible. And another thing that I might want to look at is like, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2830.44s)]
*  percentages of expenditure that's military expenditure, like over 1000s of years, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2836.44s)]
*  like I know that it and two, like two to 4% globally is definitely low compared to historical [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2841.2400000000002s)]
*  norms. But it seems to be very possible that there's some constant amount that at least [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2848.12s)]
*  got or that humanity has been kind of hanging around between, you know, 3000 BC and 1945. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2853.08s)]
*  Aaron Powell Why are there bid ask spreads at all? And is it possible to get rid of them without [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2859.24s)]
*  just putting them somewhere else, such as into mining costs? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2863.56s)]
*  Peter T. Leeson So ultimately, bid ask spreads basically have to exist and for a couple of [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2866.2799999999997s)]
*  reasons. So one of them is that offering a zero fee market maker is itself a costly activity, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2871.8s)]
*  basically, because if you do the equations, you get this result that, like you're instead of [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2879.6400000000003s)]
*  earning the average of two of the earnings of two assets, you're earning the edge, the geometric [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2885.8s)]
*  mean of those two assets, which is lower than the arithmetic mean. And so you lose a bit of money. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2891.1600000000003s)]
*  And another one is this kind of adverse selection argument that basically says, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2895.4s)]
*  if someone is trying to trade against me, then that or rather, if someone is willing to take my [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2900.44s)]
*  offer, then that by itself is evidence that my offer could be mispriced. And so because of that, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2906.76s)]
*  people are not going to be inclined that put pushing bid offers too close to other people's asks. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2912.12s)]
*  So I think it's a combination of inefficiencies, some of which are technological, some of which [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2917.56s)]
*  are fundamental. Aaron Powell [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2928.04s)]
*  And last question, by the way, if we're asking what could economics teach us that would help us [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2929.48s)]
*  more, I would think a better theory of bid ask spreads is one of the big gaps, because even [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2933.88s)]
*  sunshine trading, where you would think the information asymmetry would be away, there's [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2938.84s)]
*  still a bid ask spread. It may be lower, but not as much lower as you might have thought. But final [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2943.2400000000002s)]
*  question, what's the most fundamental reason why there seems to be a cost disease in say, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2947.72s)]
*  healthcare and education? And is this also rent extraction? Or is it something fundamental [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2952.04s)]
*  about teaching humans and fixing them up? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2956.92s)]
*  Peter T. Leeson I can't say I'm an expert on cost disease topics, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2959.7200000000003s)]
*  though, if I had to kind of blab for my knowledge of economics and personal experience, both with [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2964.52s)]
*  North America and places like Asia that have less of them. First of all, it definitely is the case [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2971.88s)]
*  that places that don't have that seem to not have cost disease have more of a kind of just get things [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2978.6s)]
*  done culture. Whereas places that do seems to have more of this culture of like, oh, you need [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2984.12s)]
*  five kinds of approvals. And I don't even mean just regulatory, it could even be [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2992.2s)]
*  intra-institutional conformism of some kind. It could also be because if you want to get things [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=2997.24s)]
*  done cheaply, then you have to basically get in people's way. And getting in people's way is more [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3006.04s)]
*  difficult in kind of more established societies where people have more expectations about things. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3013.08s)]
*  So it's basically a fancy way of the equivalent of like building a subway is cheaper if you can [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3018.2799999999997s)]
*  just bulldoze a bunch of people. But that applied to many more context and in much more abstract [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3022.36s)]
*  ways as well. Another one is probably that, like Robin's Hans's argument that wealthier societies [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3030.04s)]
*  tends to do kind of more signaling expenditure and also tends to do like a lot of the higher costs [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3037.56s)]
*  may have to do with basically increasing kind of comfort and enjoyment, even though that's [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3047.0s)]
*  even though people are willing to admit that that's what they're optimizing for. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3053.72s)]
*  Like when you think of universities having impressive campuses instead of like just being [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3057.08s)]
*  based in like piles of cheap real estate scattered across downtown, I think that's part of why [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3061.16s)]
*  that happens. And then another thing is that there are cases, I think, where like higher [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3068.12s)]
*  efficiencies are only possible because of economies of scale that just aren't there in some contexts. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3078.6s)]
*  So in the case of like land transportation infrastructure particularly, you know, like you [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3086.12s)]
*  go to Asia and like China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, like all have very impressive fast trains and you [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3091.7999999999997s)]
*  might ask, well, why don't we have them here? And then you look at people that are actually [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3097.64s)]
*  trying to build those trains and it's like, oh, five billion dollars for like how many people? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3101.64s)]
*  And the cost disease is part of it. But also I think part of it is that there is there just are, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3106.52s)]
*  especially in lower population density environments, there are going to be [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3112.8399999999997s)]
*  contexts where more kind of decentralized solutions. And in this case, I mean, like [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3116.92s)]
*  decentralized even as an Uber pool actually do end up making more sense. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3121.7200000000003s)]
*  Peter Tatevich It's been a pleasure. Thank you very much. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3125.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzAFYZeEUrQ&t=3128.0400000000004s)]
