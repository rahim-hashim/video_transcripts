# Daniel Carpenter on Smart Regulation  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [May 05, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmByOSUzlyQ)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I am here with Daniel Carpenter.
*  He is one of the world's leading experts on regulation.
*  He is perhaps the leading academic expert on the FDA.
*  He has a new book coming out this May called Democracy by Petition, Popular Politics and
*  Transformation 1790 to 1870, and he is in the Department of Government at Harvard University.
*  Daniel, welcome.
*  Thanks for having me, Tyler.
*  Now we will get to the AstraZeneca vaccine, but first let me ask about a few other topics.
*  The Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, right?
*  The goal was to replace hires by patronage with hires by merit.
*  How should we be changing that act today?
*  Oh, good question.
*  I think I would begin by saying that I'm not sure we need examinations, which by the way
*  still exist in many areas of the civil service, that we should have perhaps minimum criteria,
*  but the criteria should not be reduced to say a four-year college degree.
*  I do believe that the Pendleton Act created the basis for the decline of patronage, and
*  it took a while.
*  The Pendleton Act depended heavily upon presidential enforcement.
*  It was actually Theodore Roosevelt two decades after the act, more than two decades after
*  the act, who really implemented the pivotal administrative decisions there.
*  But I would say if we were trying to do this today, I would actually reduce the number
*  of political appointees at the top levels of the civil service.
*  It's actually relevant to some recent politics regarding the FDA.
*  Surely the leaders of an administrative agency, executive branch, or so-called independent
*  commission are appointed by the president.
*  That's an Article II power.
*  They should continue to be appointed by the president.
*  It's all of the other folks, communications, undersecretaries, and so forth, that I think
*  I'm not sure about the added value of those appointments, and I think we would do better
*  by restricting their number.
*  But the regular appointees, say the G-14s, just people in the agency, how should the
*  standards for their hiring and firing be different, or are we at some kind of actual optimum?
*  Oh, no, I don't think we're anywhere near an actual optimum.
*  I think it's worth pointing out, by the way, that the federal civil service, which we're
*  talking about here, is quite different from the state and local level civil service.
*  One of the things that merit reform did is it got rid of one form of politics by reducing
*  the link between partisanship, party organization, and appointment at the middle and lowest
*  levels, but it introduced another.
*  It accentuated and facilitated the growth of public employee labor unions.
*  And I have a mixed judgment on those.
*  I don't think you can have a conversation about policing like we're having in this country
*  right now without calling into question the value of some of those unions and the degree
*  to which they protect their members from egregious actions.
*  Obviously, there's a huge literature there as well on teachers' unions and other public
*  employees' unions.
*  At the federal level, I actually think the federal employee unions are pretty weak.
*  Part of that is just basic political science, just about nowhere other than a few western states.
*  I guess you'd probably say parts of Virginia now are federal employee unions politically strong
*  enough to make a difference in the kind of electoral calculations of a congressional majority.
*  I don't know that we've reached an optimum there.
*  I do think termination at some level should be easier for basic non-performance.
*  I do think using career incentives among a whole bunch of positions in the civil service
*  should be easier to do.
*  But I would say at the federal level, you've got a situation where, again,
*  I'm not going to say optimum.
*  If anything, I believe the last presidential administration showed us the value of having
*  an independent civil service, one that cannot be used by a party or a leader who verges on
*  authoritarian energies, while at the same time avoiding some of the problems that one sees in
*  the worst case of public employee union abuses, such as we see in some police departments.
*  If one studies the history of postal supply and regulation, as you have done, postal supply,
*  what lessons can we learn about regulating the internet today?
*  Oh, goodness.
*  Because the Postal Service was a kind of early internet, right?
*  Remarkably cheap and fast by the standards of its time.
*  Everyone had a voice.
*  It was hard to censor.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, look, there are whole sorts of folks you could talk to about net neutrality and its value.
*  I would say that our political culture in the history of the United States and much of our
*  economy and much of our education system presumed an open access, I mean, minimal cost for sending
*  letters with all these cross subsidies.
*  So the letters subsidized the newspapers, which was crucial because the newspapers kind of created
*  a much more informed society.
*  It was a platform for advertising, things like that.
*  So I don't want to go, I don't want to make a simplistic mapping from that to, say,
*  net neutrality because there are a whole bunch of other issues involved there.
*  But I do think the degree to which providers can close off access or make access to
*  this large externality much more costly is a grave concern.
*  And for what it's worth, at some level, yes, we're there with the internet now,
*  and at some level it's replaced the post office.
*  But as I recently argued in the Boston Review, not entirely.
*  There are still a large number of magazines, newspaper subscriptions, for that matter now,
*  pharmacy activities and others that rely heavily upon the postal system and probably will for the
*  foreseeable future.
*  In the 19th century, how was the Postal Service central to the progressive reform movement?
*  I think it was seen as both the exemplar of what a potentially open access
*  public service could be in a way that nobody had really thought about any other
*  function of the federal government being so universal.
*  I mean, even consider the army, which we would today say is, okay, how can you define a state
*  without its military and its army?
*  But as we know, not really until the progressive era was the United States Army unified and the
*  Civil War was fought through militias.
*  Any number of other services were, of course, decentralized to the state level, sometimes to
*  the local.
*  And so progressive saw at one moment in the Postal Service, well, here's actually something
*  that the national government can do.
*  And it can provide this platform, this platform for a democratic republic, open deliberation,
*  markets, and a much more universalized cultural dialogue.
*  I don't want to say singular cultural dialogue.
*  Pluralism was there.
*  But a much more globalized dialogue.
*  That said, I think the other thing they saw in the Postal Service, and this is something
*  that Theodore Roosevelt saw in the Postal Service, was something that was being eaten from
*  within by the patronage system.
*  And it was in part the folks in the Pendleton Act, but I would argue even more the presidents
*  who kind of really pushed civil service reform forward with their administrative decisions,
*  who said if it's going to happen anywhere, it has to happen in the Postal Service, in
*  part because there's a big part of our economy as well as our society that depends upon it.
*  And Roosevelt, before and after he made these very controversial moves to cover in, as it said,
*  thousands of postmaster positions under the merit system, actually received a lot of support from
*  shipping industries and sort of medium-sized, smaller-sized retailers.
*  Steve McLaughlin
*  If we just outright privatized the entire postal system in America today,
*  what is the most significant change that would result?
*  John Del Vecchio
*  I think you'd be cutting off
*  vast sections.
*  I mean, truly privatized without a universal service standard, right?
*  Steve McLaughlin Correct.
*  No price regulation.
*  John Del Vecchio Yeah, we're not doing
*  Ma Bell. We're not doing—truly privatized. I think basically you would accentuate and accelerate
*  the bicoastal concentration of culture, wealth, talent, and economic innovation in the United
*  States. That may be—
*  Steve McLaughlin Isn't that a good thing though, right,
*  to induce people to move to higher productivity regions?
*  John Del Vecchio Agreed. I think there's all
*  sorts of reasons to think that depopulation of some rural areas might be potentially a good thing.
*  But I also think that there are ways to do that. We certainly have lots of those pressures right
*  now. And there are also, I think, ways to do that that still—I mean, the concern I have is that
*  you're cutting off a vast number, I mean, tens of millions of people from a part of their culture,
*  again, that they still use.
*  Steve McLaughlin But those people can use Federal Express today,
*  right, or UPS?
*  John Del Vecchio Yeah, but I don't think that's going to be,
*  at least not until we get different models, I don't think that's going to be a viable model for
*  Express Scripts. Express Scripts uses the postal system for good reason. They don't use Federal
*  Express.
*  Steve McLaughlin What kinds of records should the Postal Service keep about itself?
*  John Del Vecchio Great question. Well, there's a whole set of things that they don't since the
*  Griswold decision and since the kind of First Amendment decisions. They don't keep as much
*  they don't keep as much records of kind of what goes through the mail. They can't prohibit things
*  like pornography, contraception. I think, you know, well, I guess it depends on what you mean by
*  itself. I would start with the idea that I think basic privacy restrictions, which governed the
*  postal system as much through norm as by law in the 19th century and early 20th century
*  should govern the system. So, you know, it's a crime. If I were to walk past your mailbox
*  and open your letter, I'm committing a federal crime. But there were also norms that, you know,
*  seals were not to be broken, things like that. So I do think whichever way the Postal Service goes,
*  and it's quite possible that you could imagine an electronic platform for the US postal system.
*  I think basic privacy restrictions have to be guaranteed. I also think, actually, in some
*  respects, I think we need to know a fair amount about what postal workers do without, say, calling
*  for Amazon-like tracking. But if we think that postal workers are misplacing ballots, are
*  not providing birth control pills or something like that, then, you know, we should probably
*  have some way of picking up on that kind of nefarious behavior. If we consider regulation
*  in general at the state and local level, should we think of that as simply a one-way ratchet
*  that basically just goes up over time and hardly ever goes down and eventually gets to be too
*  complex, too cumbersome, too restrictive? No, I think that narrative is pretty easily falsified
*  in the United States as well as some other countries, definitely as a one-way ratchet.
*  I mean, if we want to talk about pure monotonicity, you know, take into account first that the degree
*  to which we see price regulation, which was exactly what the Chicago School and other capture
*  theorists were so concerned about so long ago, we've seen a whole range of areas where the
*  government regulates prices far less. I mean, governments, I should say, regulate prices far
*  less. We see far less regulation of antitrust M&A than we used to. I actually think that's a problem.
*  And I'm happy to say I think that the case against price regulation, especially
*  micro-level regulation of prices, is generally a strong one, the case against price regulation.
*  We've seen a fair degree of deregulation in environmental spaces. And I would argue,
*  depending on which part of the FDA you want to look at, even in medicines approval and things
*  like that, we've seen some deregulation. This is state and local level, right? If you look at,
*  say, freedom to build, many more cities are putting restrictions on building than are
*  liberalizing. And you might expect over time, the entire southeast will become a bit like, say,
*  the California cities or Cambridge mass for that matter, where they just don't want that much new
*  to be built. Isn't that a one way? Yeah. So I think this gets to some of the differences
*  between an economist and a political scientist. I see what you're talking about as a kind of
*  regulation. Although to me, I see it much more as kind of housing policy. And I think there are
*  folks who say, well, let's try to construct a unified theory that puts the EPA installing
*  smokestack scrubbers, mergers and acquisitions regulation, zoning regulations, because it's
*  called a regulation, and say some set of price constraints and puts them into a unified theory.
*  I think the point that you're talking to right now, whether it's kind of, I think there's a
*  development in local level valuation of housing in American culture that is leading many governments,
*  I agree, to crack down on building. It happens in my own town to make building new construction
*  harder. And I could see that as ratcheting one way, except, of course, now let's talk about some
*  of those very rural areas that we just mentioned a few minutes ago that are depopulating. It would
*  be interesting, I don't know the answer to this question, to see whether there's more freedom to
*  build in areas like that. My guess is where you're going to see less freedom to build, if you want to
*  use that metaphor, is in precisely the kinds of places on the coasts and maybe in certain aspects
*  of the southeast, places that are driven in part by racial and ethnic discrimination, but also by
*  wealth discrimination, that are going to crack down much more heavily upon new building, especially
*  new residential building. Which are the most and least captured federal agencies in the technical
*  use of that term? Oh, good question. So I don't have a rank ordering for you from which I can draw
*  the top and the bottom. I think knowing some people who've been involved in the space
*  and seeing also what's gone on worldwide, I would say one agency that has been captured
*  or plausibly captured would be the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And I think there's a
*  complicated story there. The story in France, where they also have nuclear regulation, is that
*  so many of the folks who work at that agency come through the country's formidable technical schools,
*  and they're trained in a certain kind of way that leads them to be much more likely to see
*  nuclear power as a good thing. For what it's worth, I happen to be a believer in nuclear power
*  as part of a bundle of non-carbon based energy sources. That said, I think it's very plausible
*  that due to kind of professional training, things like that, nuclear regulation
*  may be a plausible case of capture, both here and again in other countries.
*  And who has captured it in the US? I think it would be some of the very power companies and
*  interests there. Again, they're the argument. Isn't that the case where the state and local
*  governments are so restrictive? Right? You cannot really get a new nuclear power plant built today.
*  That limits the supply. That's the one way street we were talking about earlier. And it's just
*  harder and harder to access what seems to be a pretty good solution for a lot of climate change
*  problems. I think that's right. But let's keep in mind that that restriction of supply
*  raises the price in some equilibrium sense for those who supply nuclear power.
*  And so it's not that I think you're right that it's state and local governments. It's a certain
*  degree of, you know, nimbism on nuclear power plants. But I would also suggest that there are,
*  it's not like you have a really robust coalition pushing for stronger or shall I say,
*  more laissez-faire attitudes on whether to build more nuclear power plants or not.
*  Let me just flip it by one. I would say for the moment, probably the least captured agency,
*  and I wouldn't say the least, an agency that is newer and less captured would probably be the
*  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That's not to say that I believe in every decision it makes.
*  I do think there's something to the way an agency gets set up that when it's new,
*  assuming it's set up in a certain way, it's got certain kind of staffers, it's got merit
*  service protection, things like that, that it is less likely to be captured. And this is at some
*  level a difference between the early political science theories of capture and the Stiglarian
*  theory. Stigler, I'm about to participate in a 50th anniversary, it's another podcast with
*  Luigi Zingales on the 50th anniversary of Stigler's theory of economic regulation.
*  His theory was really much more about legislative design and in much of the ways that you and I have
*  been talking about. But before him, there were two political scientists who were thinking in
*  similar but not identical terms. One was my late colleague Sam Huntington, who actually wrote in
*  the ICC, and the other was Marver Bernstein. And Marver Bernstein, who was at one point dean
*  of the Woodrow Wilson School, he talked about the life cycle of agencies. And so capture wasn't
*  something that was designed kind of de novo into an agency. It was something that evolved in an
*  agency that wasn't originally captured, but became so. I'm not saying that's a better model
*  necessarily, but clearly sometimes that happens when capture by design does not.
*  If your least captured agency is a very new agency, doesn't that make you out to be a lot more
*  sympathetic to the capture theory than your published work might make it sound?
*  Well, you have to remember my published work in the book with David Moss suggests that
*  the problem with capture is it's too sexy a term. David and I wrote during the midst of the
*  financial crisis, when every time somebody didn't like the decision of a regulatory agency,
*  a pundit, an academic, the term capture would be thrown around.
*  And you can think that an agency is doing a good job, a bad job, efficient,
*  non-efficient, and capture can be potentially orthogonal to that. That's the first thing I
*  would say. The second, and we really got hit, I'd arguably say more from the left than from the right
*  on this, is we actually argued it's kind of hard to prove capture. You know, you have to
*  have a counterfactual of what an agency that wouldn't be captured would in the same situation
*  Keteris Paribus be doing. And a lot of the existing empirical studies, and this goes back,
*  you know, generations, and I'm indicting a set of things in political science as well as economics,
*  suffer from the usual omitted variable bias problems. And some of them, I think,
*  were making the wrong inferences from the evidence that exists, such as, you know,
*  noticing, for instance, that in certain kinds of patterns of regulatory decision making,
*  larger and older firms did better, enjoyed, say, quicker or more favorable decisions
*  than did smaller and newer firms. And as I, you know, wrote in a, it was a mathematical essay
*  published almost 20 years ago, that can be true even when the underlying regulator or the regulator
*  in question has zero implicit or explicit preference over the kind of firm it's regulating. It has
*  everything to do with kind of, not even risk avoidance, but uncertainty avoidance.
*  How can we improve the process for public comments on regulations or pending regulations?
*  This is something I'm actually working on a bit right now.
*  Let me say two things. The first is there's a paper that your audience should check out by
*  my student Brian Lee-Gobber. He's a collaborator of mine too. And what he did, and excuse the
*  digression, but I think it's a very important paper. So if you look at the Volcker rule,
*  for instance, it was a multi-agency rule issued under Dodd-Frank. Long before the
*  comments rolled in, there were a set of hundreds of meetings with the agency that happened even
*  before the notice of proposed rulemaking. And essentially the architecture that we have in
*  the Administrative Procedures Act doesn't regulate those meetings at all. And a legal
*  scholar named Kimberly Krawiec, I believe she's at Duke or she was when she wrote the article,
*  noticed that the vast majority of these meetings, and I just go to the article,
*  but I'm going to say 90% were with either large bank holding companies. So not the smaller regional
*  banks, fifth, third, things like that. We're talking JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi.
*  Law firms representing those companies like Sullivan Cromwell. And associations representing
*  those companies. Get into a whole question about why the hybrid representation in another, but that
*  was one thing. So pre-rulemaking, pre-proposed rulemaking, earliest agenda setting meetings are
*  dominated by industrial interests. The second, and this was an asset pricing study by Professor
*  Liebgober, who's now at UCSD, showed that the banks that met with the Fed, and he only looked
*  at the Fed, and then he used a very small window for when the proposed rules were announced.
*  And they witnessed and enjoyed a statistically significant and financially significant
*  continual abnormal positive return on their stocks the moment the proposed rule was announced. Not
*  so much the final rule, because that comes much later, but the first. And he totaled up, I think,
*  40 to $70 billion of positive abnormal returns just from those meetings with the Fed, just in
*  the first hour, which is what an intraday study has to do after the proposed rule was announced.
*  So you're telling me this is good, yes? I'm not so sure. I mean, yes and no. Recapitalizing
*  banks, it's making them more valuable. It means the trading isn't all that risky. Well, not so.
*  Let's go back to your original question though, Tyler, because your original question was about
*  procedure. And to me, I guess I'd like to see open access. So I'm not saying, I'm not by any
*  means saying, hey, we need to get rid of these meetings. I do think we need to embed consumer
*  and non-industry perspectives more. And what that might mean is inducing rule writers to more
*  regularly meet with advisory committees, consumer labor, other groups, folks like the group at better
*  markets, Americans for financial reform, things like that. I'm not saying I agree with all of
*  these folks, but I do think that right now, all of our attention on notice and comment rulemaking,
*  and for that matter, cost benefit analysis as concomitant to it, misses the fact that there
*  are people who are close observers of this space. And now a very empirically sophisticated observer
*  in this space, Brian Liebgaber, who believe that most of the action is actually occurring
*  before notice and comment starts. If we take say nuclear power regulation,
*  do you think that giving all these groups you mentioned a bigger role in nuclear power
*  regulation would improve the outcome or make it worse? It seems to me it would make it worse.
*  Well, why do you think that? Citizens groups mostly don't want nuclear power. Homeowners
*  organize, try to build a nuclear power plant in Fairfax County. You have zero chance.
*  I don't know. Asking whether I know how folks would, whether the policy would be better or
*  worse is a tougher call. But here it might operate in some unpredictable ways.
*  Nuclear power regulation, you might get Steven Pinker-like voices. He's a person,
*  Harvard scholar who wrote a kind of a pro-nuclear power op-ed in the New York Times recently.
*  You might get some other voices at the table, less voices, less organized, particularly if
*  you embedded them in. And there's a great chapter in our book, Preventing Regulatory Capture by
*  Daniel Schwartz, who's shown that at least an insurance regulation in Minnesota, that Minnesota
*  has been able to do this, whether it's made folks better off or worse off, that's much harder to
*  tell. But I would argue in fact, that if you proactively embed voices, interests that wouldn't
*  otherwise be represented, that you'll actually open up the conversation. My guess, if I had to
*  think, would be the folks in Fairfax County, the NIMBY folks, the anti-nuclear power folks,
*  they're already pretty well represented in this process.
*  Is the impact of FOIA laws overrated or underrated?
*  Depending on how enforced, I would say underrated. They have had one
*  cost, which is it used to be the case, I don't want to say it's a cost, but they changed an
*  equilibrium in one sense, which is that it used to be the case that reporters had to cultivate a
*  relationship with an agency insider, a bureaucrat, in order to get information out of that person.
*  And what that led to sometimes was, of course, well, we didn't see as much, but it also meant
*  that the reporter became better informed about what was going on in the agency.
*  And there are stories you can tell, reporters and mid-level agency folks who would talk on a
*  semi-regular basis for years. Now, they kind of don't need to have that relationship to get
*  the information they want, and so they just file a FOIA request and they get it. Now, that said,
*  and again, going from the experience of the last few years, going from what I regard as a critical
*  worry for our globe, for our country, kind of creeping authoritarianism, I think FOIA is,
*  and strongly enforced because it was just weakened by the Supreme Court,
*  is one of the most important laws that we have.
*  Just clarification, what do you mean by ethics laws, like revolving door?
*  That would be one example, but restrictions on people who work, say, in federal agencies.
*  If you work at a financial regulator, you can't just let the people at Goldman Sachs take you out
*  for a fancy dinner, right? That's an ethics law. We have lots of them.
*  I see. Yeah. So I'm going to say, again, it would be easy for me to say underrated or overrated.
*  I'm going to say, you know, it really does depend. The revolving door constraints
*  might be overrated. I think I worry a little bit less about people moving back and forth than
*  others do. It turns out there's some evidence that banks and other agencies, or excuse me,
*  other firms, companies that want talent are most likely to get the regulators who are toughest
*  earlier on. And so I'm not sure it leads to the usual kinds of stories. In terms of small favors,
*  let me say that I think that's underrated. I think the psychological literature
*  has demonstrated that small gifts are sometimes the most powerful ones.
*  Okay. Now, the FDA, you've written yourself that the main function of the FDA is often
*  about information rather than safety. If that's the case, why don't we have what my colleague,
*  Robin Hanson, called the banned product store? That is, the FDA would announce what it has approved.
*  But say treatments or drugs or vaccines that had not approved, within reason, would be available
*  for purchase. You just would know you were taking your chances. Why not do that? Have the FDA provide
*  the information only? Yeah, I think I would say two things. Number one, it's a brute mechanism.
*  But the mechanism of what I would call approval regulation, which is basically the FDA is a veto
*  player, granting access to profitable markets, creates very, very powerful incentives for R&D.
*  And those are incentives that we would otherwise not have. My worry is that in the Robin Hanson
*  case, and by the way, I haven't read this particular case, but I've seen some FDA is
*  good housekeeping seal of approval. There are different ways of generating information. We want
*  the good stuff. We want the RCTs. We want credible information. I'm happy to talk about Bayesian
*  clinical trials, so-called real-world evidence. That's a term that's thrown around a little too
*  much without definition. But if we're thinking about ways that, say, a pharmaceutical company
*  can inform its potential consumers, and I mean consumers at all levels, so payers, physicians,
*  nurse practitioners, pharmacies, folks who decide on formularies, and then relevant to vaccination,
*  the people who get the shots in their arms or whether or not they adhere to the drug,
*  well, they've got other ways to do that, and that's advertising. And so you could have a world in
*  which it's kind of like a Lemons equilibrium in which essentially you would have lots of
*  bad products out competing good ones. For what it's worth-
*  Why would they ever compete the good ones? So the UK approved the Pfizer vaccine.
*  The US hadn't approved it yet. I would have the option of going to a special store and trying it.
*  We would have saved thousands of lives. But that's kind of a partial equilibrium
*  story. I'm talking about a world where these institutions didn't exist, where neither the UK
*  nor the US had anything like the FDA, anything like an approval record.
*  No, we have an FDA, but it issues judgments that are like a good housekeeping seal of approval.
*  Then there's no incentive or very weak incentives for anybody to do randomized
*  clinical trials, which I would argue is one of the most important scientific revolutions
*  of the 20th century. You want to get the seal of approval, right? That's one reason to do a trial.
*  But why if you can just go and sell it offline and then advertise your way into the marketplace?
*  This is exactly the way the patent medicine industry worked.
*  Well, look at Tesla, all the R&D they've done to create a better version of their car,
*  which they sell for a higher price. Let me ask you a different question.
*  But I think let me just stop you there because I think there's an important difference. I think
*  you're an economist. I'm not professionally trained. My wife has spent a lot of time
*  around an economist. I think the biggest difference here is that cars are experience goods,
*  maybe even inspection goods, and drugs are credence goods. We can't really know
*  whether or not, even if we were cured, whether the drug was the cause.
*  And that gets into a lot. I've written about these kinds of issues and other things.
*  And so I don't usually buy the model of cars or other kinds of experience goods
*  as mapped onto drugs because I think the information structure of those markets is
*  quite different. And I think that the role of beliefs is far, far more important.
*  And collective beliefs, if you will, Bayesian priors about whether or not such things work
*  is absolutely central and deeply endogenous to the value of the product itself.
*  A doctor today can attempt a new method of surgery without getting FDA approval, right?
*  Should we change that? And it seems to work fine, right?
*  Well, yeah.
*  And there's plenty of RCTs for surgery.
*  Yes, although keep in mind that if the doctor rolls out a new medical device, which leads to
*  a lot of surgical innovation, that device has to be approved by the FDA. There are, of course,
*  other kinds of bodies. And it's not just the tort system, but medical professional societies,
*  things like that that regulate that space very well. When I say very well, very strongly,
*  I'm not saying that's an optimum policy. But if anything, I'd say far more than in the case of
*  drugs. In the case of surgery, it's the tort system that regulates that.
*  And well, pick your poison. I'm not sure the tort system is... I mean, you could say that's
*  a system that works well. Really? I mean, do we know that surgical innovation has provided
*  that much more in terms of health benefits than pharmaceutical innovation? I haven't seen the
*  aggregate accounting. But if it has, the form of regulation there is deeply decentralized, subject
*  to all forms of bias. And that's juries. It's at the state and local level, not the federal level.
*  Right? Take off label prescriptions for drugs,
*  which are a highly significant phenomenon, as you know. That's not subject to FDA approval.
*  Should we change that? In essence, a significant percentage of total drug usage is not regulated
*  directly by the FDA for the purposes it's being used for. Right. Right. Excellent. No, good
*  question. I've thought about this a little bit. I think there's a lot of room for flexibility in
*  the current system. And one of the things that I try to say, I'm happy to criticize the FDA on any
*  number of things. And I'm sure we'll get a chance in what time we have today. But there's actually
*  been a fair degree of flexibility. Maybe it's come slower than you might hope for in cancer.
*  But cancer is kind of sui generis in many respects. Adherence rates are very high because
*  a lot of the drugs are given just directly in the clinic. It's a community of researchers that
*  it's essentially highly closed. I mean, there are some doctors here and there who do things. But
*  governed immensely by ASCO. There's a kind of a community of practice there. And so what the FDA
*  does in a lot of these cases is allows for a molecule to be approved. Say cisplatin would
*  be an example of the first platinum based chemotherapy. And then basically knows, I think
*  the FDA knows that when a lot of these molecules are out there, there's going to be off label
*  prescribing. That's not to say, however, that off label prescribing is not regulated. Whether
*  something is on the label or not is still a significant decision. And I've written about
*  the case of Bevacizumab for breast cancer. And that was a pretty significant decision by the FDA
*  and one that a number of industrial interests fought against pretty hard in part because they
*  knew that money was on the line. If we think about testing for COVID-19,
*  starting maybe with Paul Romer and Glenn Weil, who have been on this podcast, Michael Mina,
*  a variety of commentators, Alex Tabarrok now as recline, all have believed and in some cases
*  shown using measurements, mathematics, statistics, that if much earlier COVID-19 testing had been
*  available, although imperfect, that the United States would have been much better off. And the
*  FDA only now this week in the end of March is allowing such testing. Doesn't that verify
*  the old style Sam Peltzman argument that the FDA is too risk averse, too slow? And when the FDA
*  finally did let some of that testing through, you had to do it with a prescription, which seems makes
*  no sense under any worldview. Right? So was Sam Peltzman right about the FDA?
*  So let me just say, I agree with the criticism of the FDA on testing. And I'm pretty sure I
*  mentioned this to a reporter back in the spring. I don't know whether they ever, I've said this to a
*  number of folks. For what it's worth, again, keep in mind that that's actually not the same division
*  that approves drugs, which by the way, is not the same division that Sam Peltzman critiqued. So I
*  don't think it verifies Sam Peltzman. And it's not clear to me. But the general view that the FDA is
*  too slow, right? Whether it's Peltzman or not. I hear you. But actually Peltzman, for what it's
*  worth, the original article was more about sort of number of new chemical entity introductions.
*  And it was really much more about the regulation of the research process. And people like to say,
*  well, is it FDA too slow, FDA too fast? A lot of that just came from Congress, from legislation,
*  including the 1962 Kefauver-Harris drug amendments. But in this case, I think there's a very
*  plausible case. In the case of testing, yes, I think there's a very plausible case that the FDA
*  was too slow. Exactly what the public health, did that cause more deaths than say, a culture that
*  didn't take COVID seriously. People not believing COVID was a problem. Vaccine hesitancy in the
*  United States, which I think is pretty significant. That's much harder for me to, or I think for
*  anybody to judge what the marginal contribution. But I have no problem in saying that, yes, I think
*  that that was an issue. But look, we can always find a single example of where an agency was too
*  slow or too conservative, or, and I think this is the other way, stuck to its scientific procedures
*  too much without adaptability, which I think is one of the problems with the FDA and testing.
*  And not think about all the other cases in which, no, the FDA was right to abide by a certain
*  procedural conservatism. But shouldn't there be a button within the FDA that can be pushed
*  where the FDA goes into a kind of wartime mode? Let me give you another example. The AstraZeneca
*  vaccine was approved by over 15 nations, including Canada and the United Kingdom. FDA still has done
*  nothing. You might think now much later, well, only approve it for men who are over 50 due to
*  some data on thrombosis. But basically it seems many responsible countries approved AstraZeneca.
*  FDA did nothing. Had we had that vaccine earlier, would have saved thousands of lives. FDA didn't
*  seem to care. Why isn't that an example? Again, if the FDA being too slow and too conservative.
*  So I actually think the AstraZeneca vaccine is more complicated than the story that you're
*  saying. So in part, it's what, you know, Dr. Fauci, now our national healthcare celebrity,
*  but deservedly so, called an unforced error. So you should check out the Karen Landman op-ed at
*  the Times back on March 23rd. She shows that AstraZeneca has had managerial issues all along,
*  with production, with testing, early problems in data reporting, manufacturing problems in Belgium.
*  Then there were study design and data reporting issues that were called by the company's own
*  DSMB, the Data Safety Monitoring Board. So there are a whole bunch of folks. You could say, oh,
*  well, there's a whole bunch of folks who've approved it. Of course, as we know, in many cases in Europe,
*  there are people who don't want to take it in part because of its bad reputation.
*  So to me, I think- But that comes from the regulators itself, right?
*  I disagree with that. I disagree with that. I just agree with that strongly, Tyler. Yeah,
*  I just agree with that strongly. Back and forth on who should take it, below 60, above 60.
*  Again, AstraZeneca has had credibility issues all along. So the idea that vaccine hesitancy is
*  just some regulatory construct or some byproduct, I think is number one, demonstrably false.
*  And number two, I think it misses the big problem that corporate reputation matters.
*  And AstraZeneca, I could grant that, yeah, maybe we should roll AstraZeneca out there.
*  About the thousands of lives counterfactual, I'm going to disagree because it's not clear to me,
*  and you might see this problem with Johnson & Johnson. I clearly see it in a lot of conversations.
*  It'd be interesting to see survey data about whether people trust certain brands more than others.
*  And part of it is vaccine nationalism. The French don't trust the British. The British trust
*  what's endorsed by their national health service, but also their own company, far more, things like
*  that. Look, it's the same AstraZeneca company. So the British saved many thousands of lives
*  by being prompt with AstraZeneca. Surely, we don't think that is a mistake. We've had a supply
*  constraint on the vaccine side in the United States, maybe up until now. We could have done
*  the same had we approved AstraZeneca. So the company made big mistakes, but why penalize the
*  people who can get the vaccine for that, when again, you could save thousands of lives. I just
*  don't get it. To me, actually, I'm not sure that the AstraZeneca vaccine would have been taken
*  in the United States. So you referenced the Ezra Klein story, and I gave a talk recently to
*  a group in Israel and Europe on regulation, where I said the big bullet we dodged in the past year
*  was one in which there was all this pressure in summer 2020 on the FDA to quicken a whole set of
*  therapies for coronavirus and COVID-19. And this obviously started with hydroxychloroquine,
*  which I think the jury is in on that now, not effective. Convalescent plasma, probably very
*  effective, but its rollout certainly didn't help. And what you see in at least two different surveys
*  over the summer of 2020 is a pronounced drop in expressed willingness to be vaccinated,
*  anywhere from 10 to 15 percentage points. And deeply concentrated, and I think that's
*  and deeply concentrated among the young. And the mathematical models would suggest that's
*  exactly the population you want to have vaccinated sooner or later. Why? They're more mobile. They're
*  much more likely to be vectors. So I've done some back of the envelope calculations. I shared them
*  with Ezra. I've also presented them to this group. And if you just, you know, if we start to think
*  about what's the social value of, you know, good vaccination just for the United States,
*  right? And we think anywhere in the area of 10 to 20 trillion, I know some economists who think
*  it's much higher. But now we think, okay, what if the vaccine, because you could talk about,
*  could have said this with vaccine, just about any vaccine, you know, Pfizer's readout from its data
*  wasn't until November, but you could have said, well, why didn't we approve that vaccine in May
*  or June? And you would have had, I think, a social catastrophe. You know, tens of millions of people
*  not taking the vaccine. It's very consistent with those polls that right after the convalescent
*  plasma debacle showed a 10 to 15 percentage point decline in and possibly greater in
*  vaccine confidence. And you would have lost thousands and thousands of lives that way.
*  At the end of the day, vaccines are only as good, especially a treatment with positive externalities.
*  Vaccines are only as good as the set of population that takes them. And again, I emphasize,
*  it's the young that you need for herd immunity. The marginal benefit of vaccinating the young
*  is higher for herd immunity. If we look at actual behavior, if you take the United Kingdom,
*  which was the first to approve Pfizer, was quick with AstraZeneca, has a government that in some
*  ways has a reputation for being reckless, right? They have arguably weaker approval procedures than
*  the FDA. They've been one of the countries with the least vaccine hesitancy. They got vaccines out
*  there. The results already are shown to be good. More people want the vaccine. They see that their
*  uncle is not keeling over dead. Why isn't that a better theory of public opinion, that if you get
*  people good vaccines quickly, that make them healthier. More people are going to want vaccines.
*  So two things. Number one, I think that the UK is again kind of sui generis. In part, they trust
*  their own company and they trust their national health service. They've got a very good sort of
*  public system, which if we recreate it in the United States would really dramatically transform
*  that. Look, the correlation between vaccine hesitancy factors is expressed in public opinion.
*  Vaccine, vaccination, first dose vaccination of eligible population in the United States is 0.6.
*  That's an extremely high correlation. So rather than just use a story, let's actually look at data.
*  The data suggests in fact that public opinion on vaccine confidence is a very, very strong predictor
*  of actual vaccinations in the United States. The other example I would say is part of my theory of
*  the FDA is let's divorce it to some degree from vaccination more generally. Let's look more broadly
*  at what happens. It's not that just that people said last summer, oh gosh, we don't trust Trump.
*  It's that we don't trust certain kinds of procedural irregularities that are going on
*  at the FDA, which of course are very deeply Trump related. But I'll give you another example. It's
*  a completely different example in a different world, but I think it's important. It's a tragic story.
*  There's this deadly disease, Duchenne's multiple dystrophy, for which was developed a really
*  important drug called etiplersin or exondis. And it was approved under a very, and I say it's an
*  important drug, it's an important drug therapy. It's actually still not known whether it works in many
*  respects. But the FDA approval procedure was, shall we say, different and marked by much more
*  controversy than usual. The advisory committee voted against it. The division director voted
*  against it. Janet Woodcock, senior director, voted for it. I believe it was then Commissioner Robert
*  Califf who approved it over and above the other objections. And that's fine. He had his right to
*  do that. But it was clear from everybody watching that this was not the usual approval process.
*  So you say, no, what's the problem? Now we've got this drug for a deadly disease that's on the
*  market. Well, the problem is lots of insurers now won't cover it, still won't. And the New York
*  Times ran a story about this, and they got one exec to say, and I'm paraphrasing, you can look
*  up the story, but I know that I just looked up a whole bunch of Blue Cross Blue Shield groups,
*  still won't cover exondis. They basically said, we don't know whether this works.
*  And these are not folks, this is not vaccine hesitancy where you've got all the kind of
*  standard psychological, these are informed purchasers, right? And so part of what happens
*  when you have procedural irregularity or corners cut or bad evidence underlying approval decisions
*  is you get, in some cases, what might be rational hesitancy on the part of treatments.
*  I think we can say right now with the benefit of hindsight, hey, look, we've got these great MRNA
*  vaccines, we've got some other vaccines out there. Sure, if we had done things differently,
*  that's right. But of course, that's not what I would regard as a proper rational and Bayesian
*  way to think about it. The question is, what decision should we have made at the time,
*  given the information we had? You might be saying, well, I want a value function that places heavy,
*  heavy emphasis on the option value, that things could just go right here. I'm very much open to
*  that. But what I want also is a world where the unknown, deeply unknown product studied
*  or being potentially approved gets studied massively, thoroughly, and where the studies
*  continue well after approval. And that's, by the way, something else that you miss with the good
*  housekeeping model. You don't have any incentive for continual study of things that are sometimes,
*  something like Prozac or Astatin, are taken for five, 10, 15, 20, 30 years of a person's life.
*  Now, you can often get better data when you do a human challenge trial, right?
*  So do you favor those? Should the federal government have started those and say may?
*  Yeah, I can see an argument for that. I don't have any. A challenge trial,
*  I'll just, yeah, I think that's fine. Yeah.
*  That seems like a huge gain, right? It's not a small thing. Hardly any public health people
*  came out for them. Derek Lowe said he wasn't on board, would have saved hundreds of thousands
*  of lives. If our public health establishment doesn't-
*  I'm not sure about that causal estimate.
*  I'll say the vaccines would have been ready by October, right? The whole winter wave,
*  we would have had significant protection against.
*  Yeah, again- Hardly any public health
*  experts would come out for this. So again, I'm going to put out a different
*  counterfactual, Tyler. I wonder, again, and a part of this is inseparable from the fact that we just
*  had a really, really divisive election. But I actually think one big feature of the
*  increased confidence in the vaccines is that they were approved after the election. I'm not
*  saying they should have been, but I'm saying if you would have rushed things out in September
*  and October, which was precisely when vaccine confidence was at its nadir, it was actually
*  much higher during the summer beforehand, but it had sunk again 10 to 15 percentage points,
*  you would have had a vaccine that tens of millions of people were not taking.
*  How should we improve our system of drug labels? Does anyone read them? Do they give real
*  information? Can we make it better? Actually, so there's an argument. So I think one of the
*  findings out there is that black box labeling definitely changes behavior, sometimes for the
*  worse. So there's an argument out there that when you added suicidality to SSRIs, that one of the
*  results was that people were, psychiatrists and primary care physicians were prescribing them less
*  commonly to teenagers, adolescents and others, and that we had increased suicides as a result.
*  So I think we need to think very carefully about there ought to be, to call it a cost benefit
*  analysis, I think is both right and wrong. I think there needs to be a perspective consideration of
*  what the costs are of putting the health costs of putting something on a black box label that would
*  do it. The other thing I would say is, the usual argument is that doctors only what, 50 to 60% of
*  the time read the label. There are some people who say, well, then the label beyond the black box
*  really isn't effective. I actually agree. It's not that I'm generally a glass half full guy.
*  I just happen to think that actually 50 to 60% of people reading the actual label is actually
*  something that we should be pleasantly surprised about. Should we allow for placebo prescriptions
*  for depression, for back pain? It seems they might work. We do already in a sense, right?
*  Yeah, we kind of already do. I mean, vitamin D was that way for a long time, right? And so that's
*  one of the things. And again, there's where we get into a different kind of form of regulator.
*  In part, it's the FDA, but in part, it's state medical societies and practice boards.
*  If major pharmaceutical companies want to run drug trials in poor countries, often it's Africa,
*  but it could be Latin America, other parts of the world, outside of the scrutiny of US regulators,
*  should we allow that? Should we encourage it? Should we stop it?
*  I think it should be allowed, but I also think that the FDA is, or any other regulator, say it's
*  Britain's regulator, which by the way, I don't think is that laissez-faire. I think compared to
*  Europe, if anything, European pharmaceutical regulation from which Britain has just only
*  recently broken, has long been at least as procedurally conservative as the US say since
*  the 1990s. I think it's entirely fine for some of these wealthier countries to say, well, we don't
*  trust those trials, and we're not going to rely upon those trials alone in say a pivotal phase
*  three or a really important phase two trial. You get into problems with what's the quality
*  of a country's institutions, and this is something we usually think about from the standpoint of say
*  somebody like Robert Putnam or Douglas North or Margaret Levy, but I think institutions and the
*  credibility of scientific institutions is also important. Back when I wrote the book on the FDA,
*  I spent a little bit of time in India and thinking about its issues in regulating drugs,
*  and of course there's a lot of drug manufacturing in India, a lot of generics manufacturing and so
*  forth. I don't know the stats offhand, but the FDA has any number of times had to crack down
*  on generic drug manufacturers in India. There have been a whole host of quality problems there.
*  So if we think that a country has weak scientific and kind of credibility-based institutions,
*  then I'm fine with allowing the trials there, but I'm also fine with regulators in advanced,
*  so-called advanced industrial countries saying, yeah, we're not going to allow those trials,
*  or we're not going to accept those trials as pivotal for approval.
*  Okay, we now get to your new book. Again, I'll repeat the title,
*  Democracy by Petition, Popular Politics and Transformation, 1790 to 1870. It helped me
*  think about a whole host of issues anew. First question, how and why were petitions key to the
*  women's rights movement in the 19th century? Well, I think really a great question, and so I think
*  if you think about the international women's rights movement, not just the United States,
*  but also New Zealand, Australia, Canada, even France, Britain, in part women saw themselves
*  signing these petitions, not just individually, but collectively. They saw the weight of numbers,
*  and they saw that especially white women, as they learned actually, at some level,
*  Native American women in the United States were petitioning in ways that were more innovative,
*  even compared to white women. But as they saw this, what I call the accountability of voice,
*  the idea that their voices could matter, not only in the arguments they put forth,
*  but also in the weight of the numbers. I think that became a much more powerful motivator for
*  women's rights movements to make bolder and bolder claims for the vote. Why was early 19th
*  century French Canada so important for the history of petitions? This is the Hardcore Podcast,
*  in case you hadn't known. No, and by the way, your questions have been challenging and thought
*  provoking all along. This has been great. So yeah, I think actually we tend to think, oh,
*  what are the big petitioning societies? The United States, Britain, Anglo-American societies,
*  and in part, French Canada is that because it's still technically a colony. But I would say two
*  things happened. At some level, it was a Jacksonian revolution before Jackson, 1822 and even 1827 and
*  1828 before Jackson was president. You get what would be called kind of a producer's revolution
*  in favor of parliamentary responsibility and parliamentary sovereignty. And at some level,
*  you could say, well, weren't they just doing what had already happened in the United States with
*  the American Revolution? And I would say no. And let me be clear, what I'm talking about here is
*  arguably the largest on a per capita basis petition of the Atlantic world of its time,
*  a single petition with over 90,000 names attached, excuse me, 87,000 names, roughly 90,000 names
*  attached that was signed in what is today Quebec. And with which
*  the French Canadians did several things. First off, they fought off colonial fusion.
*  If you ask yourself, you know, why does French Canada still French Canada and why is Canada
*  bilingual? You kind of have to point to these petitioning campaigns as one of the reasons that
*  colonial fusion was fought off. The other thing that they did, which was not easy to do at the
*  time was to depose a colonial governor. Even in, you know, British North America, you know, the 13
*  colonies that eventually became the United States, getting a colonial governor deposed was much easier
*  through elite mechanisms going through the colonial office, going to the crown than by
*  massive protests. And that's exactly what they did with deposing Governor Dalhousie in the United
*  States. Finally, you know, as I mentioned, and there are other historians who have really, I think,
*  cemented this story better than I have Malcolm Chase, who's, you know, arguably the historian
*  of the Chartists, you know, working class reform in Britain depended heavily upon lessons that the
*  Chartists and other working class agitators in Britain learned from the French Canadians.
*  They called them our brothers in oppression in the 1830s and a whole host of things that happen
*  as the suffrage is open, as a whole bunch of changes happen in 19th century Britain, were
*  taken with at least partial inspiration from French Canadians, the patriot movement, as I
*  describe them, and these petitions. Let me ask you an analytical question and please try to give
*  me an answer for both the middle of the 19th century and then for today. So there's a bunch
*  of different hypotheses you might have about petitions, that they strengthen the relative
*  power of what is truly popular, or you might think it strengthens the relative power of groups who
*  organize well, or maybe groups who are good on the media, groups that are good at fundraising.
*  On net overall, on average, for each of those two periods, what do you analytically see
*  as the major effect of petitions apart from any particular case?
*  Yeah, excellent question, Tyler. So I think the 19th century is easier to answer because that's
*  what I just wrote about. What I see is, particularly during this crucial period,
*  say the 1820s to the 1850s in the United States, Canada, parts of Mexico, people who didn't already
*  have organizations, didn't already have parties, which of course in the United States especially
*  were really important technological innovation, didn't already have lobbies, didn't already have
*  interest groups, were able to successfully harness the petition to make their voices better heard,
*  to set the agenda. I think agenda setting is really important when we think about democratization,
*  and also to organize. I mean, what I argue in the book is that everything from anti-slavery societies
*  to new parties such as Canadian reform parties, the American Whigs, and others drew much of their
*  energy and structure from early petitioning campaigns. Look, we're in a different world now,
*  especially in the United States, where I don't think petitions have quite the societal and
*  historical imprint that they used to. There's a whole bunch of reasons for that, but I want to
*  answer your question. I would say now, in part, we don't have, let me just first bracket this by
*  saying we don't have anything like the legislative petition process that we used to have in the 19th
*  century. By the way, Canada still does, and Canada still gets I think 1500 paper petitions per year.
*  Now we could get into a whole argument about whether that changes anything. I think what
*  you're going to see with petitioning nowadays, especially of the electronic variety, occasionally
*  of the plobiscitary variety, like the initiative and referendum, is that select
*  groups and interests that know how to make something go viral. And virality, if I can use that
*  term, was there in the 19th century now, but you have to make it get hot right away. I'm reminded
*  of that. There was an electronic petition signed about 10 years ago contesting new card fees at
*  Bank of America. I think it was by somebody in Chevy Chase. And I think that was a very
*  controversial issue. I remember the story was in the, and immediately, like within days, hundreds
*  of thousands of signatures, Bank of America backed down. I don't know what, by the way, whether
*  that's good or bad economic policy, probably an effective petition from the standpoint of having
*  changed things. And can you imagine any other institution, the courts, parties, through which
*  that would have happened? Nowadays, we could say social media, somebody could jump on the social
*  media and say, hey, look at this awful card statement I just got. And then you get a bunch
*  of likes. So it's some kind of aggregation mechanism like that that can do that. But I don't
*  think we have the kinds of institutions that we used to, in part because we don't have a petition
*  institution that structures robust public debate as much as we used to. And I think that's a problem.
*  If I look at state level referenda, I tend to think it's a bad idea to make them too easy,
*  California being Exhibit A. Do you agree with that view or differ from it? And if you agree
*  with it, doesn't it mean you now think petitions actually have become on that somewhat harmful?
*  Yeah. So I do agree with that. I teach a course at Harvard called Republica, or it used to be
*  called What is a Republic? And I argue that I think it's problematic when not just say a policy,
*  but any constitutional amendment, as has occurred in several states, can occur with just 50 plus
*  epsilon percentage of the vote of the people who happen to show up on a given day. And we know that
*  some of these are small turnout elections. So let me just say that's about initiative and
*  referendum. I'm not going to wax much more generally about, say, school financing or bond
*  issuances, things like that. But at the level of California, yeah, I do have problems with those
*  institutions, in part because it weakens the separation of powers. It weakens deliberation.
*  One advantage of representative government is that there are certain kinds of deliberation
*  and investigation that go on. It weakens compromise. It's either we're going to have this
*  ballot proposition or we're going to have the status quo. And nobody gets to go into the ballot
*  and say, oh, let's think about a third option between the two that might be better than both.
*  The ballot and the plebiscite doesn't give you that option. I distinguish for that reason between
*  plebiscitary petitions and what I call directed petitions. I also worry about plebiscitary
*  petitions. And I don't think they have the same value, institutional robustness,
*  and benefits that directed petitions, which are the kind of petitions that I write about
*  in Democracy by Petition, do. And so in part, the answer to the question is, yes, I agree that I'm
*  not that high on the initiative and referendum process. Ohio, by the way, if I can bracket,
*  has a policy that might be a little better, which is to say, all right, we're going to let the
*  legislature pass a law. So we're going to respect the Republican small r process, separated powers,
*  things like that. We're going to allow the people to veto it. But then the agenda is then set by
*  the Republican process, mixed regime and so forth, not untrammeled, purely discretionary
*  lawmaking power or constitutional amendment power, again, given to that 50 plus epsilon
*  percentage points of people on a given day. And then what I will just say again is I think in part,
*  you know, petitioning, I don't want to, I don't know if it's net harmful, it's definitely become
*  less beneficial in part because of the way that plebiscites have transformed the petition.
*  What would be an example of a reform you would like to see that would make current
*  American government more democratic at any level? Well, let me extend
*  part of the logic of my book a bit. I actually think it wouldn't necessarily be such a bad idea.
*  If legislatures were to reintroduce, I'm not saying this would be the top ranked
*  reform, but I don't think it would be such a bad idea if legislatures at all level of government
*  had to reintroduce petition days, such as govern the United States until the 1950s,
*  and many state legislatures. And what it would mean is that I think part of the problem that we're,
*  you know, we've got institutions that are efficient at some level. If we want to take a mass of, you
*  know, millions, hundreds of millions of people, and condense their preferences down into a single
*  platform, and a single label, parties do that well. The problem is, is that so much gets left out of
*  the process to say nothing of the kinds of polarization that can end up really kind of
*  breaking a society into two, which I do think we're in at risk of in the United States. And of
*  course, which has happened before. And so it would basically be a way to make not just the United
*  States more democratic, but actually to make the democratic republic more deliberative,
*  which would be to, and it would be inefficient, I'll be honest, you know, and at some level,
*  you could say, well, yeah, wouldn't legislators, you know, be better off, you know, reading,
*  you know, scholarship from economists and doctors and things like that, and getting
*  presentations from people in the know, you could argue, yeah, maybe they would. But I actually think
*  it would potentially increase social trust. And by the way, New Zealand and Canada do this now,
*  right? Of course, you can always say, well, yeah, New Zealand and Canada do everything better. Maybe
*  they do, maybe they don't. But, you know, it's not unknown for this to occur in the modern,
*  in the modern day. And so again, giving the, you know, the people a sense of being heard,
*  and then I would say arguably potentially opening up the legislative agenda, because I think there's
*  a degree to which, you know, the closure of agendas, which makes parties efficient,
*  often prevent some of the best ideas from, you know, reaching the table of policy.
*  Last two questions. First, can you tell us a bit about your work with Native Americans and
*  Indigenous peoples more generally? Yeah, so I grew up in a very small town in Michigan.
*  My wife also grew up in a very small town. She actually grew up on a farm,
*  right next to an Indian reservation, and we had one near us as well. I didn't think about it for a
*  long time. But when I got digging into this petitions project, I spent a lot of time in
*  the archives, as I did in the FDA book. And as I began to look into the petitions, I just saw more
*  and more petitions from Native Americans. And that's part of the reason that I emphasize them
*  as much as I do in the book, is that on a per capita basis, you know, maybe the French Canadians
*  aside, you know, few people are petitioning as much as they are. And then that got me into thinking,
*  also, you know, why don't political scientists study Native Americans? I mean, there's, you know,
*  millions of them, you know, especially you start to take a look at Alaska, First Nations,
*  things like that. You've got all this variation in tribal governments. So part of it was an
*  intellectual interest. And then without getting into a long personal history, I'm not Indigenous
*  myself, but I've got a number of family members who are on different both sides. In part, it was,
*  you know, hearing just different stories around dinner tables, family reunions,
*  things like that, that made me start to think that these are things that we should probably be
*  studying. The work I do now is in part work on Native history, allowing these people to understand,
*  not allowing them to understand, they understand it pretty well. Working with them to better
*  understand their histories of petitioning, advocacy, things like that, lobbying. And in some cases,
*  like one of the courses I'm teaching right now, part of what we do is work with particular tribal
*  communities, nations that are dealing with some pretty significant issues like, you know, suicide
*  and suicide prevention at the Fort Peck Reservation, or, you know, traditional food gathering practices
*  and the way they're regulated by state governments and the kind of maze that
*  different Native Americans have to navigate as they practice their traditional cultures.
*  Last question, how and why do you enjoy fly fishing?
*  Thanks.
*  Thanks. I think maybe you'll disagree, but I think most of your academic visitors
*  would agree that sooner or later you need something where when you do it, you can't think about work.
*  Not that you just don't, but you almost can't because of the absorption into a task. I disagree
*  with those who say that fly fishing is some kind of Zen practice. I mean, I've spent enough time,
*  you know, freezing on a stream fishing for steelhead in the Great Lakes or the Pacific
*  Northwest or fumbling with my knots and things like that. There are moments that are, I don't
*  even know what Zen is because I don't practice it, but there are moments that are definitely
*  contemplative and lovely, but it's absorbing. And it's absorbing in some very beautiful places.
*  I've got a brook trout right behind me in a picture. It's one that my students see in all
*  my lectures. I happen to think that brook trout are some of the most beautiful creatures on the
*  planet, proof for the existence of a divine. And I like spending time around brook trout.
*  Daniel Carpenter, thank you very much.
*  Thanks so much, Tyler. It was an honor.
