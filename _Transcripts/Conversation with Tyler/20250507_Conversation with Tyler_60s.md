# What Jack Clark plans to do next with Claude Code | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k)
*  And just what would you do personally? I'm not saying the world, but just you, Jack Clark, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=0.0s)]
*  you have all this free compute. Will you have a try to write another play by Shakespeare or [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=4.4s)]
*  something else or how Brighton might've developed differently from year 1830 or what are you going [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=8.56s)]
*  to do with it? The thing which I currently do with Claude Code is I'm trying to write a really [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  detailed, good paperclip factory simulator, partly because of the inherent comedy of it, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=18.8s)]
*  but also because I find these very complex simulation games incredibly fun and engaging. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=24.16s)]
*  And I also think there's a massive space in which you can create them, of which we've only [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  created a tiny subset. And one of the things that we haven't ever really done is because it's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  computationally so unbelievably expensive, is actually put AIs as agents inside the games. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  Really early attempts were actually the MS of DeepMind. Before he did DeepMind, he did a game [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  called Black and White, which had actual very primitive reinforcement learning driven agents [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=50.8s)]
*  playing in the game. I think there's tons of stuff you can do there, which would be amazingly [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  interesting. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2KTaTjaj0k&t=59.519999999999996s)]
