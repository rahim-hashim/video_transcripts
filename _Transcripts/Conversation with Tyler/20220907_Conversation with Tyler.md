Video Description: Vaughn Smith is fluent in eight languages but with a beginner’s grasp of at least thirty-six (and counting). His talents are so remarkable that the Washington Post did a feature story on him and neuroscientists at MIT requested he do a brain scan for them. But for Vaughn his language skills aren’t about attracting attention or monetary gain. “Language is a key to someone's culture, to someone's world,” he explains. Whether it’s watching a client’s face light up when he speaks to them in their native tongue or showing Indigenous children in rural Mexico that their language is valuable and worth preserving, Vaughn views his gifts as a way of connecting with other people.

He joined Tyler to discuss how he began learning languages, the best languages for expressing humor, why he curses in Slovak, why he considers Finnish more romantic than Portugese, what makes Hungarian so difficult to learn, the best way to teach people new languages, how to combat language loss, why he’d like rural Mexicans to have more pride in their culture and way of life, his time as a roadie for a punk rock van, the most rewarding job he’s had, why he wants to visit Finland, how enjoying films from different eras is similar to learning new languages, the future of English, and more.

# Vaughn Smith on Life as a Hyperpolyglot  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [September 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQTc6eBKUTg)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I am honored to be here with Vaughn Smith, who is a hyperpolyglot, and he lives
*  in nearby Maryland.
*  Vaughn, welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  How many different languages do you dream in?
*  Dream, let's see.
*  I think I've had dreams in about 10 languages or so.
*  And what would those be?
*  Recently I was dreaming in Czech.
*  I think I had some Latvian words sprinkled in there.
*  I dream in Nahuatl, Spanish, Russian, English, of course.
*  Some others, I can't exactly remember.
*  It might have been a long time ago.
*  Slovak also.
*  Oh yeah, I did.
*  I had a dream in Slovak.
*  I was speaking to somebody in Slovak.
*  In my dream, of course.
*  And that's about all I can remember right now.
*  And to varying degrees, how many languages would you think you have at least a beginner's
*  grasp of?
*  At least a beginner's grasp of?
*  That would be about 36 or so.
*  And fluent in?
*  Fluent in about eight.
*  About eight.
*  What's your history with being a hyperpolyglot?
*  Did you wake up one morning and you're five years old and you just start learning other
*  languages or you realized in school you were good at this?
*  How did this happen?
*  Slowly a realization, I grew up bilingual when I was very young because my mother-
*  English and Spanish.
*  English and Spanish.
*  My mother would take us to Mexico and learn Spanish there, come back.
*  So as far as I remember being bilingual, and then I think when I was about, let's say 11,
*  I took an interest in learning French.
*  And when I was about 13 in school, started learning German just on my own.
*  And this was not directed by the school, you just did it?
*  No, it was not directed by the school.
*  So it started with my mother having material in French, my mother's fascination herself
*  with the French language.
*  Did they make you take language classes in school without a form of torture or you enjoyed
*  it or?
*  No, no one made me take any classes.
*  I didn't take any classes.
*  I simply just took out, studied out of my own interest.
*  And was there this moment in your life where you think, well, I'm going to do this as a
*  thing or just you kept on going and here you are, you know, dreaming and speaking however
*  many languages?
*  When I was about 15, leaving Alice Steele Junior High School, going to Wilson, that's
*  when I decided, OK, I want to do this.
*  I want to learn more languages.
*  And this is going to be my thing.
*  This is going to be something that I'm good at.
*  I can see that I can learn it pretty quickly.
*  My peers are telling me, wow, I've got good pronunciation.
*  I can memorize the words, the vocabulary pretty fast.
*  So that was the turning point.
*  Which languages of those you know do you think are best for expressions of humor?
*  Expressions of humor, definitely Spanish, Russian, to a degree, Finnish.
*  I think those three.
*  What makes Spanish and Russian good for humor?
*  Spanish, what we are from, particularly the Mexican Spanish variety that we speak, which
*  is from Orizaba Veracruz State.
*  It's a very vulgar and a very colloquial Spanish.
*  And every other sentence that anybody says on a regular daily basis is either some sort
*  or a pun on something, a metaphor.
*  And it's a very rich language in that sense.
*  And Russian?
*  Russian, so like the Russian friends that I learned from are also very witty and they
*  enjoy telling jokes all the time.
*  Mucha.
*  What makes Nahuatl such a beautiful language?
*  Nahuatl is, I think it's just the sound, the way it flows.
*  It's a very quickly spoken language.
*  And like when I'm listening to it, when I speak it, it just kind of puts me in the place.
*  And the place where it's spoken is a very beautiful, lush, mountainous, natural, bucolic
*  place.
*  And I've never spoken Nahuatl that associates with someplace boring.
*  There's nothing boring about it.
*  And the people are very friendly when they speak the Nahuatl language.
*  And I think those things kind of like give me the picture of Nahuatl being beautiful.
*  It also has this very rich civilization behind it, which is not in every way still there
*  today.
*  But unlike a lot of languages spoken only by, say, two million people, it was language
*  of an empire, right?
*  Absolutely.
*  Could you say something for us in Nahuatl?
*  Altepec, ito casa, Rafael Delgado, nozo San Juan del Rio.
*  And Nahuatl varies a lot from village to village.
*  How do you decide which one to learn?
*  I learned the one that was closest to me.
*  You mean physically closest to you?
*  Well, when I talk about this, I'm sorry, let me back up a little bit.
*  So I forget to mention that for a part of each year, I live in Mexico, in Orizaba.
*  That's my mother's hometown.
*  And just south of the city, about like a 10, 15 minute bus ride is the village of Rafael
*  Delgado.
*  That's where everybody speaks it on the street.
*  They speak mostly Nahuatl and then Spanish is secondary to them.
*  So that would be the proximity that gives me that plus the fact that it's a distant
*  cousin of mine who is a professor of the Nahuatl language who taught me.
*  And you try to study written Nahuatl?
*  That's hard to do, right?
*  There just isn't that much.
*  You just speak it and that's it.
*  Now when you say written Nahuatl, you're talking about the phonology that's the Latin characters.
*  That the Spaniards imposed on Nahuatl in varying forms after the conquest.
*  That's not difficult for me at all, no.
*  So you could read something in Nahuatl?
*  Well, I could write it perfectly, yes.
*  Yeah, okay, great.
*  Yeah, as far as the actual words that I know.
*  If there's some new word, I might have to find out.
*  But usually if I go by pronunciation, then I can write pretty much anything.
*  Do you think it's more fundamental to your learning the written form of the language
*  or the spoken?
*  Spoken.
*  Spoken.
*  And then you move to figuring out how to read it?
*  Yes.
*  Do you feel you think different thoughts in different languages?
*  Yes, I do.
*  And how does that operate?
*  I don't know.
*  When I get angry, when somebody cuts me off or something, I'll curse out in Slovak.
*  And I think that the reason for that is because when I lived with Dusan and Tanya Pavelkovy,
*  they were the people from Slovakia, the eastern Slovaks.
*  Vychodnárya, that's what we call them.
*  Eastern Slovaks are known for their aggressive demeanor, just hot-blooded people.
*  And they're always cursing and swearing.
*  And when they get upset, they always have something to say, which is pretty nasty.
*  And I picked up on this a lot because I spent every day working with these people.
*  And it pretty much picked up as a habit.
*  I'm driving and someone comes to me, I was like, I don't want to say it because, you
*  know, bad things, they would be bad words.
*  Pri sáham bohu, like I swear to God, that sort of thing.
*  That's just like a lighter version of what they say.
*  And it's just like that's stuck with me over the years.
*  So that would be one of the examples.
*  Yeah, feelings of, you know, little fits of rage here and there.
*  They come out in Slovak a lot, even if I'm in Mexico, I'll say it.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, when I hear Russian, and Russian is a language spoken in my home, though not by
*  often sounds to me like the people are angry.
*  When you speak Russian, do you sound more like you're angry?
*  When I speak Russian, you know, I tell people this when I'm teaching them Russian or tutoring
*  Russian, Russian is a loud language, just taking into consideration the majority of
*  the people that I've met that speak Russian, it's always loud.
*  Vsigda gromka, náda pár ruský gromka govít, eto ne chvátit tak tícha, eto amerikántsy
*  vod tích chváriát.
*  It's twice the energy output when someone's speaking Russian, even if you're just at a
*  table at the house.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you read much historical linguistics or you just focus on learning languages?
*  I focus on learning languages and periodically I'll delve into the history of linguistics.
*  One of my favorite books is a one that was sent to me by Neola Skrypskyte.
*  She's a Lithuanian and she sent me a book called The History of the Lithuanian Language.
*  And it's a very fascinating read.
*  I haven't read the whole thing from front to back, but I'll read little chapters here
*  and there when I have some free time, I look into it.
*  And it goes into the older Baltic variants that were much closer to, well, I guess what
*  people consider Sanskrit, for example.
*  From the loan words, from Old Norse, and the other interesting little facts of how
*  the words are put together.
*  So something like Chomsky on structural linguistics.
*  Do you have an opinion on that?
*  I have not read the book.
*  The Sapir-Warif hypothesis?
*  I'm not familiar with it.
*  Do you think the Romance languages are in fact better for Romance?
*  No.
*  What's the best language for Romance and why?
*  I don't think about it that way.
*  What's the best language for Romance?
*  I guess any language has a capacity of being romantic.
*  If you're thinking about romantic feelings of couples getting in love, that sort of thing.
*  No, even Finnish is more romantic to me than say Portuguese.
*  That's amazing.
*  And what makes Finnish so romantic relative to Portuguese?
*  I had a girlfriend who taught me Finnish.
*  Ah, that will do it.
*  Which kinds of languages are hardest for you to learn?
*  What kinds of languages?
*  Would it be tonal, agglutinative, click languages?
*  I think when I study a language, grammar is super important to me.
*  So I think it's always like I don't have a problem with pronunciation.
*  I can learn different writing scripts.
*  That's fine.
*  So I think the two biggest challenges here for me would be something that's a very complicated
*  grammar.
*  For example, Estonian or Finnish, Hungarian and Lithuanian, I think to me are grammatically
*  very challenging.
*  And as far as orthography and writing systems, certainly kanji or Chinese symbols, Chinese
*  characters, Mandarin characters would prove difficult because there's a lot more to memorize.
*  What do you think has been for you the hardest language to learn?
*  The hardest language for me to learn, I would say Hungarian.
*  And what makes Hungarian so hard?
*  Several noun cases and a very rich vocabulary, very large vocabulary.
*  And a lot more words are in regular use to say specific things more so than say any of
*  the Germanic languages.
*  An opposite of that would be, for example, Norwegian would super easy.
*  You just have one little word.
*  It doesn't change.
*  It doesn't inflect the verb.
*  The person of the verb is the same.
*  No matter who is it that does it, there's simply the infinitive form.
*  There's the past participle.
*  And then there's the present, which you'd simply put the letter R after the vowel of
*  the infinitive.
*  And that's grammatically just giving an example of how easy it is for me to learn Norwegian
*  grammar.
*  Everything is difficult about Hungarian as the case is knowing what case, the singular,
*  the plural form.
*  The verb changes when the recipient of the verb, if it's in the first person verb, it
*  changes when the recipient is in the second person singular.
*  Set at nælek instead of set at næk, for example.
*  Set at nælek, I like you.
*  Set at næk, I like.
*  And these little nuances and all these exceptions to rules and irregularities that make the
*  language grammar very difficult.
*  Do you ever learn languages through music?
*  Yes, I can say that.
*  By singing, by listening to songs, or how do you do it?
*  Translating lyrics, listening?
*  I started with when I was back at Wilson High School.
*  I met Sergey Kuznetsov and he loved music.
*  And he gave me these tapes.
*  This is the early 90s, everybody used cassette tapes.
*  He gave me these cassette tapes with bands like Kino, Krematori, Nautilus Pampelius,
*  Russian bands.
*  And from there I would listen and already some of the words I could recognize, little
*  words here and there.
*  But then I started putting it together.
*  If I listened to the songs, if I knew about 50% of the vocabulary of a sentence, I could
*  figure out the rest of it.
*  And I could guess some of the words or at least bracket down the possible meanings of
*  certain words and later find out, oh, okay, it was this or it was that, it meant this.
*  And certainly a lot of other music that I get from, in Czech and Slovak, I decipher
*  it the same way.
*  How do you think about your own memory?
*  Do you feel you have a good memory for all things or just languages or the variance of
*  your memory is high or what's your own model of that?
*  I have a good memory for languages, certainly, but also for numbers, words, directions, how
*  to get places, good land navigation.
*  As far as things that are difficult for me to remember, it's difficult for me to remember.
*  I find it sometimes, schedule memory.
*  For example, someone would say, hey, Von, at seven o'clock on Saturday, do this.
*  And the time would come around.
*  I'm not thinking about it.
*  It's simply that's an attention span thing.
*  It's not like the recollection, but it's simply not memory, not catching something at
*  the time when it was scheduled.
*  Now, of course, I have a calendar, I put everything in the calendar, so it's not a problem.
*  But that was difficult.
*  That was a difficulty for me prior to that.
*  I have a good memory for economic arguments, but I have a very poor episodic memory.
*  That is, I don't remember episodes from my life very well, and it's hard for me to
*  tell stories from them.
*  Does that sound familiar to you at all?
*  Not really, no.
*  So you have good episodic memory.
*  I have good episodic memory.
*  Yes, that's good.
*  The other hyper polyglots, I mean, do you know them?
*  You're like, what's up with them?
*  Or just like you read about them once and that's it.
*  I'll see some here and there.
*  I met Richard Simcott via Skype.
*  So I've met him, spoken with him.
*  That was while the Washington Post article was being written.
*  And are they fun?
*  Like, are those the people you hang out with or they're just another group of people?
*  Well, Richard Simcott, I've never hung out with him in person, but I really enjoyed the
*  conversation and I made plans to meet with him in Mexico in October for the Polyglot
*  conference that he is hosting.
*  But other than that, I have not met polyglots that know more than say eight
*  languages or so.
*  And the ones that I do that know some languages, we have a meeting that we do
*  every Sunday, the district language exchange, and it happens at different places
*  on typically on Sundays at about 5 p.m.
*  We used to meet at Meridian Hill Park on 16th Street, Northwest D.C.
*  We'll meet at places such as Dacha Beer Garden.
*  And when I meet with someone, it's really fun just to skip from language to language.
*  And we're just kind of like, yeah, we're practicing.
*  We're impressing all these other people that are standing around us looking at us.
*  And so it's always fun to just, OK, I know this one, too, and we'll jump from this to
*  that. Yeah, not people that I hang out with on a daily basis.
*  I don't have a close friend that's a polyglot or nor do I have a close friend that
*  knows more than, I don't know, regularly that would speak more than five languages.
*  How many hyper polyglots do you think there are?
*  I don't have no idea.
*  But we know what a thousand at least a thousand at least.
*  It's what I would imagine.
*  And is it your intuition that everyone who has that skill learns it and does it?
*  Or is there some expansive people out there who could do it but somehow have never been
*  attuned to it?
*  I agree with that second possibility.
*  There are people that are simply they have the capacity, but they just don't live in a
*  place where they're exposed to the languages and they might not.
*  They might not participate in active language learning to the degree that I have or that
*  other hyper polyglots have.
*  They might use superior memory capabilities for other things.
*  How does language retention differ from language acquisition?
*  Or is it just the same?
*  It's you have to maintain languages or they just stick with you.
*  So I'll give an example.
*  Recently, I think it was two weeks ago, I was in front of the Bulgarian embassy and it
*  was a Saturday that the European Union, European Union embassies were having their open
*  house and we were going from embassy to embassy.
*  I went to the Latvian embassy, had a pretty good conversation and I realized I had not spoken
*  Latvian for more than 15 years, but I was still able to converse.
*  Yeah.
*  Some of the words, they're there, but it might take me some time to think about the words.
*  OK, well, that word is saldaiums or jautaiums, little simple words like that.
*  Actually, those poor examples, because those are words that I know too well.
*  But if I, is veitsinat, they would just come slowly.
*  It's just a matter of just putting myself in the place of the language and just kind of
*  like a slow computer rebooting information, bring it to the forefront so that it's ready
*  for use. Bulgarian was the same thing.
*  I was in front of the Bulgarian embassy and then someone comes up and I had not spoken
*  Bulgarian for about 10 years or so.
*  And here I am having a conversation Bulgarian again, but it was a lot faster than, for
*  example, the Latvian conversation for the Latvian embassy.
*  So I saw an answer to that.
*  I remember I don't have a problem memorizing the words that I studied well, but some of
*  them, if like if I'm learning new words, then of course I have to come back to it
*  repetitively to actually commit them to long term memory.
*  You mean some technique of spaced repetition?
*  Yes.
*  Could you say something in Latvian for us?
*  For example, manliekas, manliekas, lislietu sara, un vel, spiidsaule, varut velak spiidsaule.
*  Nezinu.
*  Now you're in a typical case, but do you have views on how we should teach languages to
*  other people better?
*  How to teach language to other people better?
*  Don't cram so much vocabulary into one little session.
*  Mix it up.
*  Some writing, some reading, but a lot of listening.
*  People learn by listening.
*  Humans grow up listening, doing nothing but listening, and that's how they acquire
*  language, and that should be reflected in teaching methods.
*  If you think of your own acquisitions.
*  So for most individuals, it's relatively easy to learn a new language without an
*  accent also at a young age, and it gets progressively harder.
*  Do you think that applies to you or not really?
*  I think that it got a little bit more difficult, but not by much.
*  But not by much.
*  Are you willing to tell us how old you are?
*  Yes, 46.
*  46.
*  And you just think that will keep on going for some while still, and you can just keep
*  on learning.
*  Yeah.
*  And you have particular aspirations such as, well, I want to learn Otomi or whatever
*  the next thing is, or it just happens.
*  Otomi, it's pretty interesting that you say that because it's one of the ones I
*  would like to learn.
*  Oh, good.
*  And why Otomi?
*  Otomi, because that is spoken also in the State of Veracruz.
*  And I've had some contact with some Otomi speakers, but never really sat down with
*  them to learn anything.
*  But I have literature and music that is written in Otomi.
*  It looks very beautiful.
*  Otomi probably is dying out, or don't you think so?
*  Dying out as far as the state of indigenous languages in Mexico, it's pretty much the
*  same.
*  It's like they're, okay, well, there's less few and fewer speakers every year
*  because the youngsters are not willing or they're just for some reason sticking to
*  Spanish instead of their own indigenous language, or they're learning English instead.
*  As far as actual numbers, I'm not exactly certain, but I know that many indigenous
*  communities are putting efforts into preserving their languages.
*  Do you worry much about language loss as an issue?
*  Absolutely.
*  And is there anything we can do?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  There are different methods I see.
*  For example, I'm in Orizaba, Mexico.
*  The two of them, there are two professors, Armando Alonso Limon, Miguel Torre.
*  They're both related.
*  One is an uncle and one is nephew.
*  The two are pretty much the fluent go-to people of the town.
*  They know all the vocabulary, the words for every plant and animal pretty much as far
*  as memory can go.
*  And they are actively thinking of ways, efforts that they can continue to teach the
*  language.
*  They teach at bilingual schools.
*  So the kids go to the school, they're learning Spanish, they're learning Nahuatl at the
*  same time, and he speaks to them in Nahuatl as much as he can.
*  And so looking at these methods, you know, when I started to learn it, the Nahuatl
*  language about 25 years ago, I arrived at Armando's house with a pen and a book to start
*  writing things down.
*  And then I realized when I went into his house, that about six other kids had come also
*  with pens and books to do the same thing.
*  I think that when the kids saw that an outsider, even though I'm half Mexican to them, I'm
*  an outsider.
*  I look like an American.
*  I don't speak 100% native Spanish like a typical everyday Mexican there because I don't live
*  there all the time.
*  So for them to see an outsider, someone coming from the United States, even though I spent
*  my childhood in Mexico, I'm looked at as pretty much a gringo.
*  And here is this American coming and he wants to learn our language.
*  Well, wow, that's all of a sudden they realized, okay, well, people want to learn our
*  language. Our language has value.
*  And I see that when it's kind of like I'll take interest in a language that's not spoken
*  by very many people.
*  And when I do and I'll have sometimes my niece will be with me and she'll want to learn some
*  words, too. And we have this really friendly approach.
*  Hey, I'd like to learn some of these words.
*  What does this mean?
*  And it just really just kind of gives them a sort of reminder.
*  It's an uplift. These things that this language that we know that's spoken by very few
*  people and this culture of ours is very valuable.
*  People see it and they appreciate it.
*  Linguistic issues aside, how do you feel rural Mexico is doing now?
*  Rural Mexico, rural Mexico struggles economically.
*  Absolutely that much there.
*  So many different ideas how to put it all together.
*  Their land is sort of being taken away and used for commercial reasons.
*  They're being exploited.
*  They're very they're laughed at when they come to the city and they get a lot of discrimination,
*  especially from the young kids.
*  They'll go to school and they'll be made fun of because they're indigenous.
*  That would be like indigenous people from rural areas all over Mexico.
*  Yeah, I think what you know, when I when I see the people, they seem very happy and
*  they're smiling and they're going about their business.
*  But I think there's there's an underlying sort of melancholy and the sort of like this
*  feeling of being second class.
*  They don't say it directly, but I can sense it.
*  And if you could change one thing in the parts of rural Mexico you're familiar with,
*  other than just more resources in every way, what would that be?
*  If I could change it.
*  Well, certainly set up schools, prioritize the language and make it so that rural people
*  see themselves the way city people or urban's see themselves and they live.
*  That just that same amount of pride, that value, that self-worth needs to be brought up.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah, I'm sorry.
*  Go ahead.
*  Yeah, I'm sorry.
*  Go ahead.
*  Do you think more people should leave rural Mexico or fewer should leave?
*  Leave rural Mexico.
*  Before the cities, not for the US, but just move to Mexico City, move to Guadalajara,
*  or Veracruz, wherever.
*  That would be something that's that's really not for me to say that people they move for
*  economic reasons or something they need to find a job here or there or they just need
*  work.
*  I think that there's an importance to the rural way of life that's for every place,
*  even in the United States, a lot so in Mexico too.
*  And I think that it's just more resources, a better economic stance, just an economic
*  foundation for rural areas.
*  People need to stay where they are.
*  They move away from the rural areas and the rural areas are missing something already.
*  What's your favorite food in rural Mexico?
*  My favorite rural Mexico, it would be barbacoa.
*  Yeah, it's amazing when they put it under the earth overnight.
*  It's incredible.
*  It's the best barbecue in the world, I think.
*  I've seen it done.
*  Yeah.
*  Mole, of course.
*  But that means many things.
*  I mean, which mole?
*  Mole, the one that is made in Orizaba is the mixture of the chocolate base and all the
*  nuts and oil and the various kinds of pepper and seeds.
*  When they say mole, they only mean that one thing.
*  It's that brown sauce and it's usually served with turkey.
*  Yeah.
*  You'll put turkey in there, it's really good.
*  And that's very rural.
*  That and the barbacoa.
*  As far as other things, they'll probably just like roasted chicken, but that's not
*  especially a rural thing.
*  That could be done anywhere, but I just happen to enjoy a rural barbecue here and there.
*  The part of Mexico I used to go to in Guerrero, mole would mean a sauce with pepitas and maybe
*  white onion and herbs, but nothing like chocolate nuts, not at all like Puebla or Oaxacan mole.
*  No, that's very different.
*  I'm not familiar with that variety of mole in that case.
*  And very, very hot, sometimes almost impossible for me to eat.
*  And Oaxacan mole is not really spicy, right?
*  No.
*  But I think mole is actually the Nahuatl word for sauce.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it means.
*  Yeah.
*  It's striking to me, there's a whole bunch of Nahuatl words in English, like tomato,
*  coyote, right?
*  Coyote, chocolate.
*  Yeah.
*  Your abilities with language learning, what is it exactly that you think makes you special
*  with those abilities?
*  Is it memory or dedication or some combination of qualities?
*  I think a combination of those, memory, the dedication and the love of language.
*  Yes.
*  So it's just super fun for you.
*  It's very fun for me.
*  And it will just always be fun.
*  It'll always be fun.
*  Yeah.
*  It'll always be rewarding.
*  Up and down the street, I'll be at the grocery store, people are speaking, they'll sing something
*  Lithuanian or like they're looking for something in Russian, they don't know where to find
*  it.
*  I'll point it out and say, oh, okay, cool.
*  And so I just help somebody.
*  Maybe there are some people that don't speak things very well, so I'm always there to lend
*  a hand.
*  And that's always rewarding.
*  Duolingo apps, are they good?
*  Do you use them?
*  I use a Duolingo app to learn Welsh.
*  Welsh.
*  Yes.
*  It has been very useful to me, although it's very slow paced for me.
*  Welsh is hard.
*  How is your Welsh?
*  I can speak Welsh.
*  I can have a basic conversation in Welsh.
*  And what is Welsh?
*  Do you speak Welsh?
*  That sounds good.
*  What do you think of tutors, online tutors on services such as Italki?
*  I am not familiar with those at all.
*  You can use a Zoom call or Skype and just talk to someone around the world.
*  You might have to pay them, but they'll talk to you for as long as you want in their languages.
*  I think the tutoring, for someone who cannot go to the country, who cannot be immersed,
*  I think that would be a very valuable tool, certainly.
*  Thinking of your own life, if you were to go back to your 12 or 16 year old self and
*  tell that person something, advice, whatever, what would it be?
*  Keep at it.
*  But you did keep at it, right?
*  So that's not what you needed to hear.
*  Not necessarily, because I wasted time in doing other stupid things.
*  So I think a better word would be stop doing the stupid stuff and focus on this.
*  And you were a kind of roadie for a punk rock band?
*  That's right.
*  Was that a smart thing or a stupid thing?
*  No, to me that was not a stupid thing.
*  Sounds like fun.
*  What was the band?
*  The Goons.
*  The Goons, yes.
*  I drove the van.
*  I was pretty much a designated driver for about a year.
*  I think it was 2000.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  And that was traveling in the US?
*  They might have traveled somewhere in the US, but when I went, it pretty much took them
*  from DC to New York, Hartford, Connecticut, and all those shows.
*  We'd stay with Gabby of Molotov Cocktail in Manhattan, or stay some places in Hartford,
*  Connecticut.
*  We'd see Boiling Man and other shows, and a lot of other bands would come and play together
*  the same shows.
*  And that's still what you like best in music, is punk?
*  That's my, I think in my formative years, that's what I listen to the most, punk and
*  hardcore.
*  So, yeah, that's like my go-to music.
*  Yeah, great.
*  What's the story of how you ended up in your current job as carpet cleaner?
*  It's my brother's business.
*  So you work for your brother?
*  Yes.
*  Does being a carpet cleaner make it easier to learn languages?
*  Because your mind is not full, say, in the way it would be if you were a lawyer, that
*  you have to worry about memorizing parts of the law, and you're just free to focus on
*  language, or that doesn't matter?
*  No, there's nothing rewarding about carpet cleaning that's conducive to learning languages
*  at all.
*  I think my most rewarding job was just the caretaker at the grounds of the Central East
*  European Art Foundation, because that's where I was speaking language all the time, every
*  day.
*  It's where I learned to speak Czech fluently, where I learned to speak Slovak fluently.
*  That's where I brushed up on my Bulgarian, and Romanian and Serbian as well.
*  I'd speak those languages because I worked with people from those areas.
*  As far as carpet cleaning, maybe I'll have a customer, or I've had a customer who speaks
*  Latvian and a customer who speaks Finnish, a Norwegian customer.
*  I had a customer, the same customer, I think three times or so, a woman from Ireland who
*  speaks Irish Gaelic.
*  And she was very surprised.
*  Oh, I'm sure.
*  Yeah.
*  How good is your Irish Gaelic?
*  About as good as my Welsh.
*  And how do they react when you just speak to them?
*  Well, they get this look, they're just taken aback.
*  They're like, what?
*  Is it curry?
*  With gaelic yogurt?
*  Yeah.
*  And what do you tell them?
*  What do you tell them?
*  What do I tell them?
*  I've been speaking Gaelic for about 10 years.
*  I'll say, would you like to come down and have a look at the carpet?
*  Stuff like that.
*  A little sentence here and there.
*  Not much of a standard conversation and getting into details, but just some simple sentences.
*  What's the hardest stain to get out of a carpet?
*  The hardest stain to get out of the carpet, I would say wood stain, Kool-Aid, dyes.
*  Kool-Aid, really?
*  I'm surprised.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all just dye.
*  They might have changed the formula so it's not as permanent of a color, but like colors,
*  dyes, that sort of thing.
*  Nearly impossible.
*  The purpose of dye is to stain.
*  That's what it was designed for.
*  So if you've stained the carpet, the dye did its job and there's no reversing it because
*  it's that good of a dye.
*  Would it make sense for you to work as a translator or do you think being interested in so many
*  languages is in some way inconsistent with that?
*  I would be interested in working as a translator, yes.
*  For the languages you know best?
*  For the languages I know best, I would say, yeah.
*  Do you still put time into learning those even better or it's more like I want to do
*  Oto Mi Next?
*  I'm always switching it out.
*  I'm always going from book to book.
*  So no, certainly there's much more to learn and even the languages that I speak more or
*  less fluently, I'm still learning specific words.
*  I don't know the words for makeup in a lot of those languages because it's never a subject
*  that I had spoke about.
*  Specific terms, being able to speak about chemistry, physics, that's also kind of important.
*  That's something I want to learn to do in areas that I can explore to improve languages
*  that I know.
*  Are you keen to do an interlude where you just speak a few languages for us?
*  Yes, I could.
*  Okay, shall we try Vietnamese?
*  Vietnamese, I'm not thinking Vietnam five.
*  Just like a simple question like do you speak Vietnamese?
*  My Vietnamese is just super elementary.
*  It's really not enough to have a conversation.
*  How about Dutch?
*  Dutch?
*  Dutch, yeah.
*  Dutch I can speak well.
*  I had a friend from Groningen.
*  He was from the north and his name was Bram Stahl.
*  We became friends after three years.
*  He invited us to Silver Spring for a summer trip.
*  Finnish?
*  One day I was in Mexico and I heard a man say to a man, someone asked him where he was from.
*  He said he was from Finland.
*  I said yes, I speak Finnish.
*  I want to get to know you.
*  Do you speak Sinhalese?
*  Sinhalese.
*  My mother speaks Sinhalese.
*  She speaks Vietnamese.
*  Again, Vietnamese is just very simple.
*  Portuguese.
*  I know that one.
*  Today is Thursday.
*  Portuguese.
*  I can speak Portuguese because my friends from school, I spoke with them every day.
*  After school we went out together just to enjoy the city.
*  So that's why I can speak Portuguese.
*  And you know both Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese?
*  Mostly Brazilian Portuguese.
*  I would not know how to specifically imitate the accent of Portugal Portuguese because I don't have enough exposure to it.
*  And even in English, can you speak different ways?
*  So could you speak the way a Scottish person would speak?
*  Or that doesn't count.
*  I don't know, like a Scottish person, I suppose I was, I met someone who was talking about the color green.
*  She was talking about the color green the whole time.
*  She was kind of like mimicking her accent.
*  But yeah, I really like the way the Scottish English sounds.
*  As far as other dialects, I spend a lot of time on the bayou and the wall to come through the house.
*  That's all the people talk about is the wall to come through the house.
*  How much do you travel in terms of going to these places?
*  Last time I was in New Orleans was in 2007.
*  2006 and then 2007.
*  That was it for Louisiana.
*  But I spent a good two weeks there with a Nealick family just outside of Chalmette, Louisiana.
*  And as far as other places, my father used to have this pilgrimage where we would travel all across the US
*  and go visit my grandparents who lived in Santa Rosa, California.
*  It's in Sonoma County, about an hour north of the Bay Area.
*  And on the way, we'd stop at different places, explore Lewis and Clark National Park, for example, in Montana,
*  the Badlands in South Dakota, or we'd stop somewhere in Kentucky.
*  And the accents, they change from place to place.
*  Some of them are a lot deeper than others.
*  What especially stood out to me was the English spoken in rural Kentucky,
*  the southern tips of Indiana and Illinois, and then going into Missouri, just those rural areas.
*  It's very different. There might be some super old style of speaking,
*  a much deeper accent than what I would typically hear in the middle of West Virginia, for example.
*  But say, do you want to go to the Netherlands so you can hear Dutch for two weeks?
*  Oh, certainly, yeah.
*  But you don't have the chance to? Is it part of your program?
*  Or you think you will, you hope you will, or you have?
*  I hope I will. Just looking for other employment.
*  Post-COVID, work got pretty slow, and I started doing five different jobs.
*  I had five part-time jobs.
*  I've been doing away with those because work's getting a little bit busy,
*  but I'm not in a financial scenario where I could do that very easily now.
*  And is there a country where you think, well, that's where I want to go,
*  if you had a number one choice?
*  A number one choice.
*  To go and live for a month, two months?
*  Finland.
*  Finland. And what interests you about Finland, in addition to Finnish?
*  Yeah, Finnish.
*  The Lapland, just the northern climate,
*  the lakes and the nature, and that people say it mimics.
*  Minnesota, of course, I'm familiar with Minnesota.
*  And the Kymmenejärviä Kaikkialla.
*  Just like hundreds of lakes all over the place.
*  Being able to go north and see the northern lights,
*  the reindeer, the flora and fauna of the country,
*  and visiting friends.
*  It's one of the very best countries for architecture, I think.
*  And oddly for Russian food.
*  Russian food in Finland is much better than Russian food in Russia.
*  Which is generally not that good.
*  That's pretty interesting.
*  Well, the ingredients are better, it's more of a market economy.
*  This is all pre-sanctions, of course.
*  I've only been to Finland once, but I really quite liked it.
*  I want to go back.
*  I was only in Helsinki.
*  But I thought it was quite an underrated city.
*  That's what I hear from other people as well.
*  It's a place I gotta go and visit.
*  And there are just no hassles to being there.
*  I mean, not an issue for you, but you can just speak English to people if you want.
*  Right, of course.
*  What's your favorite movie?
*  My favorite movie? The Thing.
*  The original The Thing.
*  What do you think of the remake?
*  The remake was, they made a prequel to it.
*  Is it not exactly a remake?
*  No, actually there is an original The Thing that's prior to the Kurt Russell.
*  The James R. Ness.
*  And then there's the 1982 one.
*  The 1982 one is the one that's my favorite.
*  That's excellent. I think the earlier one is also good, though.
*  It's scary only by, say, 1950 standards.
*  But if you can get yourself into that mindset, it's quite a good movie.
*  That's the key to enjoying a film from different areas, getting yourself into the mindset.
*  I'm glad that you mentioned that.
*  And a lot of people can't do that. It's not unrelated to linguistic issues.
*  It's like you have to crack the cultural code of some era.
*  That's very true.
*  And most remakes of movies are much worse, but with The Thing, it wasn't worse.
*  They understood what was good about the original, but still improved on it.
*  Is it like the horror element or the science fiction element that draws you more to The Thing?
*  I think it's a combination of both.
*  I do like science fiction as long as it's not too far-fetched.
*  It's like, come on, this doesn't make sense.
*  But certainly fathomable in what goes on in The Thing.
*  And I really like the creepy aspect of it.
*  Not knowing that someone's infected before the person's infected.
*  That mystery, that it's kind of like a surprise.
*  It's, oh, this person was one of them this whole time.
*  And that really brings out that scary element.
*  What are the open tabs on your browser right now?
*  Open tabs on my browser? I don't know.
*  Language learning? They're in different languages?
*  That's all up in your head.
*  That's just all up in my head.
*  Yeah, tabs on my browser.
*  I guess like the phone browser, just things that I've been looking up.
*  Like I have an open browser tab, the Washington Post article about you.
*  Because that's what I'm working on, for instance.
*  No, I just don't keep open tabs like that.
*  I have a lot of open tabs at the moment about other hyper polyglots.
*  Because I write up on them to talk with you.
*  Yes, that's a good analogy.
*  That's a good example.
*  But I don't really keep the open tabs in that manner.
*  I'm more of an old-fashioned person.
*  I carry books around with me. I read books.
*  Paper books. They're in my car.
*  I probably have ten or so books in there.
*  But open tabs on my browser,
*  I think maybe I'd see like the YouTube.
*  I'm trying to put more YouTube channels up.
*  So it's something that I'm looking into.
*  So you might reopen your YouTube channel?
*  Well, the YouTube channel is...
*  It's active.
*  But I want to upload more videos.
*  Yes, I'm going to upload more videos on the YouTube channel.
*  How many videos are on it now?
*  Probably only three.
*  There were more and I took some of them off because I simply didn't like the quality of them.
*  Some of those were open tabs on my browser until I found them.
*  I finished listening to them last night.
*  And what's your goal with the YouTube channel?
*  To promote language.
*  Talk more about language.
*  Give lessons in languages here and there.
*  Give some cultural advice along with it.
*  Have little snippets of conversations with other people.
*  And just giving you an example.
*  Hey, this can be done.
*  This is something that's not impossible.
*  If you want to visit this country, here are some tips.
*  I'm going to give you a couple of tips.
*  One, you can go to the YouTube channel.
*  Two, you can go to the YouTube channel.
*  If you want to visit this country, here are some important words and phrases to know.
*  Things such as of this manner.
*  And also, I'd like to focus on a digital language as well.
*  Nahuatl and other languages that are found throughout the North American continent.
*  Being a hyperpolyglot, what do you think would be something other than the languages themselves?
*  But something that you've learned that the rest of the world should know better than they do?
*  Language is a key to someone's culture, to someone's world.
*  Even if you do not happen to be in that person's country at that time.
*  It's very sacred and it's very private for some people.
*  Not everyone will be very open to immediately speaking to you in their own language.
*  But the majority of the people that I approach or I'll ask about,
*  they have this very pleasant sort of reaction to it.
*  And then when the language is being used,
*  it's not just a language.
*  When you get into learning the language,
*  you start to think in a different way.
*  You realize every language works differently.
*  It makes people think differently.
*  The nuances of how the words work,
*  when you put them together,
*  but then when you learn the language,
*  you realize there's more to it.
*  There's a soul to the language.
*  It's like you're starting to become this new,
*  miniature other person version of yourself.
*  When you use that language,
*  it comes with the native speaker's sense of home,
*  sense of belonging, sense of identity.
*  Language is identity for many people.
*  It's much more than just mimicking words.
*  It's knowing what phrases to use,
*  being sensitive to another language speaker's cultural needs.
*  You find out you're going into a different world.
*  Recent immigrants aside,
*  as you know, most Americans speak only American English.
*  Do you foresee that changing in the future?
*  Do you think they will find persuasive,
*  what to me are quite significant reasons
*  to learn other languages,
*  but most people don't do it, don't even really try very hard?
*  In America, Europe can be different,
*  but if you're not connected to the language
*  through your parents or where you were born,
*  some people learn Spanish,
*  fewer yet learn French,
*  tiny number try Chinese,
*  but not much happens here, right?
*  And is that going to change?
*  Yes and no.
*  I think that in places where it's a requirement
*  to know a second language
*  in order to get a job somewhere,
*  of course a little bit of a job,
*  of course a lot of people are going to seek that out.
*  I've noticed a difference
*  between the generations.
*  Me being in my
*  early 20s, mid 20s,
*  I met people from Louisville, Kentucky
*  or from some other city
*  in Indiana
*  that are learning Russian.
*  And that really was not so much
*  the case when my father
*  was in his 20s.
*  People were like, no,
*  there was an immigration people,
*  Italians would come to the house,
*  they'd get a place, they'd just speak English,
*  it's like, no, it's American, it's time to be American,
*  we need to forget Italian, it's just
*  English, English, English.
*  And I see this sentiment repeated when I meet others,
*  like I'll go to New York and I'll see Italians,
*  and they're like
*  a generation older than myself,
*  and they'll say, no, when my parents
*  came from Italy, they spoke only English
*  because they wanted us to learn only English.
*  There is already a big
*  difference between the 1950s,
*  1904s, 1950s, and
*  that time would be, I'd say
*  the 1990s, where it's like,
*  no, there's
*  globalization is happening, there's
*  more business, there's more incentive to learn
*  another language, they're teaching foreign language
*  in high school, they're starting to
*  come up with immersion schools
*  where the kids are
*  raised, they're taught bilingually,
*  starting with even
*  kindergarten or first grade.
*  So I see that trend, that's already
*  a very big difference there.
*  So will it continue?
*  Yes, I think it will continue more as you
*  have more immigration,
*  you have
*  much more trade,
*  open markets
*  between nations,
*  and certainly
*  there is the
*  potential for the increase
*  of interest in language learning,
*  especially in the
*  rural, sorry, in the urban areas
*  where it is, or like
*  people who
*  people looking for
*  like
*  IT lawyers,
*  jobs such as these, this kind of employment,
*  or it's all white collar work,
*  then yeah,
*  but as far as, there's still always going to be
*  that population
*  that is not exposed to it,
*  they'll just simply continue with English
*  only, and that will
*  continue as it is.
*  I think of media coverage of hyper polyglots,
*  is it accurate,
*  off base, fair, balanced,
*  or? I really haven't seen enough media
*  coverage. But there's an article about you, probably you
*  read it, right? Yes.
*  Did it capture the essence of you,
*  or? I think it was
*  a very well put together story, it was
*  a little bit different from what I expected,
*  because it was like
*  I thought that the story was going to concentrate on
*  just me being polyglot in language
*  and such, but no, it was more just like
*  an overall sort of like,
*  the way the story was told was very,
*  it was like a very
*  pleasant surprise, I would say.
*  A very beautifully written piece, it was just
*  a lot
*  larger than I thought it would be, and
*  just kind of like a
*  very nicely put together story,
*  but I don't have, I haven't
*  seen other articles
*  on other hyper polyglots or polyglots
*  that would give me any sort of comparison.
*  How do people in Mexico
*  respond differently
*  to you being a hyper polyglot than people
*  in America? Are they more shocked, or are they
*  just taken in stride, or?
*  I think
*  it's a toss up,
*  it's all the people that are very shocked,
*  it's the people that are just taken in stride.
*  If I'm in Mexico City, I think that's where
*  I get the most surprise.
*  Or if I am in
*  any
*  of the touristy areas, where there
*  are hostels,
*  I could go to
*  Orizaba, I could go to the south, to the
*  village, and say, oh I know all these languages.
*  Oh, it's like,
*  kind of like they get this wide eyed sort of look on
*  their face, and they would think, oh wow,
*  that's pretty impressive. But then that's
*  the end of it. If I,
*  in contrast to that, I'll be in the city of Oaxaca,
*  where you have visitors
*  from all over the world come through, and I'm
*  at the hostel, and I'm speaking Irish Gaelic.
*  Funny enough,
*  the most instances where I speak
*  Irish Gaelic are in Oaxaca.
*  Because you get a lot of people from
*  Ireland, they'll go to Mexico instead of going
*  to the US, and a lot of them speak Gaelic.
*  And so they'll hear me
*  speak that language, I'll speak Russian,
*  I'll turn around and speak Czech to someone.
*  I've met people from Poland,
*  from Serbia,
*  from Croatia, and then
*  when I'm switching from language to language,
*  the Mexicans themselves, they really
*  see it happening. It's a live show.
*  And
*  number one, and number two,
*  the Mexicans in Oaxaca, they're
*  in a place where they're surrounded by languages, and it's
*  like in their face, it's like, okay, there are these
*  many languages. It's not just,
*  there isn't just only
*  French, German,
*  Spanish. But there's
*  Mixtec, the Zapotec, the Oaxacl,
*  it must be
*  15 languages in Oaxaca. In Oaxaca,
*  I think there are, yes, I think that's about
*  right, 15. Yeah. Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  So when I'm talking about the
*  Mexicans living in Oaxaca
*  that are there, they just kind of look,
*  they look at these European languages
*  and they think, okay, well, that's what
*  a real language is. They still have
*  this prejudicial
*  sort of like
*  downplay on their own indigenous
*  languages. The linguistic diversity
*  in the state of Oaxaca is
*  phenomenal.
*  And that
*  the language is different, one
*  from the other, much more so than the Germanic
*  languages amongst themselves. For example,
*  the Romance languages.
*  That's
*  very easily overlooked
*  by the majority
*  of the
*  urban population of Mexico.
*  Where do you still want to see in Mexico?
*  I would like to
*  see el Cañon de Cobre.
*  I'll take that train ride.
*  Yeah. I've never done that.
*  I've been to Chihuahua, but I didn't have time.
*  So that's on my list as well.
*  Yeah, I want to explore more of Chiapas.
*  I want to meet up with my friend
*  Juan, who is
*  periodically teaches me, he gives me
*  little lessons in Zotzil.
*  And spend more time in
*  San Cristobal de las Casas.
*  And yeah,
*  that's the place I would like to spend some more time in
*  and see the north of Mexico as well.
*  Central America?
*  Central America, I would like to see
*  I've been to Belize already, but I would like to go back,
*  of course.
*  I would like to go to Guatemala.
*  There are countries where I cannot
*  understand the people speaking English.
*  And Northern Scotland sometimes
*  counts as that.
*  Do you have that issue or you just hear through
*  it somehow?
*  You know, it's interesting. I think that
*  recently
*  The Caribbean also can be hard for me when people speak
*  English.
*  Yes, it is English, but maybe
*  I understand a third of it.
*  Yeah, I've met people from the Caribbean
*  that I couldn't tell if they were speaking English
*  or a very heavy accent English, or it
*  was like a creole. Or a mix sometimes.
*  Yeah, they'll blend the two.
*  They were saying, stay ya,
*  instead of stay,
*  he gon' stay ya.
*  And really just sort of
*  very altered
*  speech, but I could
*  tell the base words were English, or at least part of
*  it was. The conversation
*  that I heard on the bus, I could make out what they were saying, but
*  not live. I listened to the whole
*  sentence, put it together, and
*  say, oh, that's what she said.
*  As far as
*  to give an example with Scottish
*  English, I know that the
*  how the islands, the land kind of breaks up the
*  further north you go. It's my
*  idea that the further north you go,
*  the more distant
*  the accent is, and
*  the more difficult it is to understand.
*  Have you ever studied Singlish, the
*  Singaporean, it used to be
*  slang in a dialect, now it's almost becoming
*  a language. I don't know of it, no.
*  Very hard for me to understand.
*  How about Indian English,
*  English, is that the future of English?
*  Is that the future of English? Well, it's
*  the present of English in India, that's for certain.
*  Sure. But say, 80 years
*  from now, as possibly our
*  birth rates fall,
*  Indian birth rates are falling
*  as well, but what will English
*  be, do you think?
*  Most of the speakers won't be
*  North Americans, right? It's already the case.
*  Oh, I suppose
*  each
*  variant of
*  English where it is spoken will sort
*  of, just
*  kind of like what's going by the natural
*  law of language, it'll
*  change, but
*  I don't see it becoming a big
*  mush just yet, where it's all
*  uniform.
*  English used to be uniform,
*  and it went into the direction where now
*  there are many different variations of
*  English, many different accents, so I
*  don't see it coming back together, as long
*  as there are different areas where English is spoken,
*  it'll keep
*  evolving in its own
*  natural direction.
*  If you meet a young person
*  who has polyglot talent,
*  and they ask you for
*  advice, what do you tell them?
*  Advice on what?
*  Advice on learning?
*  They'll say, well, you've done it.
*  Let's say, I'm 18,
*  I'm a polyglot or potential polyglot,
*  I see I have this talent, what is it
*  I should know? You would just say, stick with it.
*  Yeah, stick with it.
*  I'm assuming that if
*  this person's a polyglot, he already has, he or
*  she already has developed a
*  system for himself or herself, as
*  to the most effective way to learn,
*  so I don't need to give this person any learning advice.
*  The systems are different, in your view.
*  Well, they could be different, but as long as
*  if someone's a polyglot, that means that
*  that person came up with a
*  system that was effective for himself or herself.
*  For them, yeah. Yes.
*  Then, instead, so
*  I wouldn't give any linguistic advice, I would say,
*  probably ask them, like,
*  what is it you want to do?
*  I would concentrate on
*  have that person
*  maybe focus on a
*  very useful language.
*  At least one. At least one very useful
*  language that would give
*  that person an advantage
*  in
*  in academia.
*  For example, learn
*  Russian, learn Spanish, one of
*  these big languages. Chinese.
*  Mandarin Chinese, French.
*  And last question,
*  in young people, if
*  they show some inclination, do you think you can
*  spot polyglot talent? And if so,
*  what is it you look for that a person
*  might become someone like you,
*  or they might stop at, like, a mere seven languages
*  and just call it a day?
*  Children that I've met
*  that have special abilities,
*  some of them being autistic,
*  I would
*  spend a few
*  minutes at each meeting
*  showing them something, quizzing
*  them. Some of these people were very
*  some of these kids were very inclined
*  to, they were like
*  a math genius, or they were good at science,
*  or good at physics, and I'd ask them about
*  okay, well, the
*  why is tungsten used as a filament in a bulb,
*  for example.
*  Most of the time it was like, with
*  scientific
*  quizzing, and then I would go,
*  okay, after that, I would test them with
*  language, like, can you memorize this word? What's
*  this called? I'd start with English, of course.
*  I'd point out ten different
*  things, what are these called, and then I'd say,
*  do you know any Spanish?
*  I'll test them in Spanish, or I'll test them in something else.
*  Sometimes,
*  these are, a lot of these are
*  children of my friends, and my friends
*  knowing me, they would like their children
*  to learn Spanish,
*  Portuguese, whatever it is that
*  they think is
*  useful for their child to learn, so
*  I would go and test them. And
*  some of them actually, they do, they pick up
*  very quickly on the words.
*  And I think that part of it is the
*  fact that they're young, they're still
*  at this age where they can absorb language very quickly.
*  But, after that, I would
*  speak to my friends
*  with the kids' parents and say, hey,
*  this is a good way to go about it, do this.
*  I've met customers
*  that, they speak German, but they only
*  speak English to their kid, and I'd say, hey,
*  teach
*  your child your language.
*  And they'll say, oh, really?
*  Why is this Carpenter telling them?
*  And I would tell them, look, it's important.
*  Teach your child your language.
*  Speak to her in only German.
*  Don't worry. She will learn, there's plenty
*  of English all around, there will be no
*  problem with her learning English.
*  Some older people worry that
*  if they teach their own language to their
*  kids, it'll somehow replace English,
*  they won't, they won't learn English at all.
*  That's simply not,
*  not realistic, because we live in a country
*  where English is spoken.
*  Vaughan Smith, a real pleasure. Thank you very much.
*  Thank you very much.
