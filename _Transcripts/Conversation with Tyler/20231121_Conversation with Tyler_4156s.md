You might be surprised by what occupies Daniel Kahneman’s thoughts. “You seem to think that I think of bias all the time,” he tells Tyler. “I really don’t think of bias that much.” These days, noise might be the concept most on Kahneman’s mind. A forthcoming book, coauthored with Cass Sunstein and “a brilliant Frenchman you haven’t heard of” is about how random variability affects our decision-making. And while we’ve spent a lot of time studying how bias causes error in judgment, Kahneman says, we aren’t thinking nearly enough about the problem of noise.

In November, Kahneman joined Tyler for a live conversation about bias, noise and more, including happiness, memory, the replication crisis in psychology, advice to CEOs about improving decision-making, superforecasters, the influence of Freud, working in a second language, the value of intuition, and why he can’t help you win arguments with a spouse.

# Daniel Kahneman on Cutting Through the Noise | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE)
*  Hi, everyone, and thanks for your listenership. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=0.0s)]
*  Conversations with Tyler has grown bigger than ever this year, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  and I hope in some ways at least better than ever. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=10.24s)]
*  Now, there's a new way you can support the show. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Today, through the end of the year, you can visit [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=16.4s)]
*  conversationswithtyler.com slash donate to make a financial contribution. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=19.12s)]
*  All donations will go to the actual production of the show, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=25.36s)]
*  including new conversations every other week. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=28.88s)]
*  Note that unlike many other podcasts, we often travel to guests, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=32.24s)]
*  or maybe they travel to us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=36.0s)]
*  We've never done a remote interview. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=38.16s)]
*  Plus, I need a lot of books for my research. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=40.56s)]
*  We also put on live shows in Northern Virginia, San Francisco, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=43.76s)]
*  New York, with more to come. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=48.0s)]
*  And there are full transcripts of every episode enhanced with helpful links. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=50.4s)]
*  This year, the podcast has featured some of the best-known [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=55.44s)]
*  thinkers and doers in the whole world, like today's guest, Danny Kahneman, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=58.48s)]
*  or recently, Eric Schmidt. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  No less importantly, the success of the podcast has given a broader platform [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  to underrated thinkers such as Agnes Callard, Juan Pablo Villarino, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=70.24s)]
*  and Michelle Dawson. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=75.12s)]
*  I think of the unifying theme behind Conversations with Tyler is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=77.12s)]
*  learning how to learn. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=81.36s)]
*  It's about how I learn from all of these other people. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=83.12s)]
*  That, to me, is what ties all of the episodes together, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=86.64s)]
*  and I hope that makes the world a wiser place. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=90.08s)]
*  If you believe in this theme, please consider supporting the show at [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=93.2s)]

*  Thank you for coming, Danny. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=138.16s)]
*  You've worked on so many topics, let me start with the issue of happiness. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=139.76s)]
*  If you have an experience, it seems that how happy you are at the end of the experience, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=143.76s)]
*  it depends on the end of the experience and how good was the peak or how bad was the bottom. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=149.76s)]
*  Given that result, should we aim to deliberately structure our experiences so they give us [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=156.44s)]
*  more happiness? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=162.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, if you want good memories, good endings are really important. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=163.28s)]
*  The question is how important good memories are relative to the experience itself, but [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=172.16s)]
*  no question. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=177.32s)]
*  Ends are very important. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=178.84s)]
*  They are particularly important in the context of goal striving. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=179.84s)]
*  That is, whether you achieve a goal or don't achieve a goal colors the whole experience [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=184.16s)]
*  of trying to get to it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=189.76s)]
*  So ends are very important for memories. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=194.72s)]
*  So do people structure their vacations to meet the standard or there's a kind of market [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=197.86s)]
*  failure if they listen to you, they would have better vacations? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=202.26000000000002s)]
*  I'm not at all sure. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=205.22000000000003s)]
*  My guess is that people are conscious of, you know, that they don't want the peak to be [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=209.02s)]
*  too far from the end. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  That's my guess. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=218.10000000000002s)]
*  And why does duration of pain seem to matter so little for how we evaluate painful experiences? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=219.46s)]
*  Well, you know, if you were asking what is the evolutionary value, then the duration [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=225.38s)]
*  of pain is really not very important. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=231.22s)]
*  What's important is the intensity because the intensity is a measure of the severity [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=234.1s)]
*  of threat. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=237.9s)]
*  The duration is really something else. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=239.12s)]
*  It's very striking that it's completely insignificant when people in many situations, it's completely [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=241.38s)]
*  insignificant. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=249.78s)]
*  Quite a striking result. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=250.78s)]
*  You also have a paper on happiness with Alan Kruger using what you call the day reconstruction [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=252.94s)]
*  method. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=258.46s)]
*  How much people enjoy different experiences. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=259.46s)]
*  And one result from that paper is how much people enjoy spending time with their friends. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=261.74s)]
*  If that's so much more enjoyable at the margin, why don't people do more of it? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=266.16s)]
*  Well, altogether, I don't think that people maximize happiness in that sense. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=270.58s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons that I actually left the field of happiness. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=276.38s)]
*  In that, I was very interested in maximizing experience, but this doesn't seem to be what [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=282.38s)]
*  people want to do. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=287.74s)]
*  They actually want to maximize their satisfaction with themselves and with their lives. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=289.42s)]
*  And that leads in completely different directions than the maximization of happiness. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=294.26s)]
*  And do you think that telling people you'll be happier a particular way changes their [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=300.78s)]
*  behavior much or they still stick to maximizing a sense of satisfaction with their lives? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=305.5s)]
*  No idea. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=311.82s)]
*  I haven't tried. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=312.82s)]
*  You know, there is a lot of work these days on trying to make people happier and on trying [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=313.82s)]
*  to coach people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=319.78s)]
*  In the UK in particular, it's a whole, you know, there is, I wouldn't call it an industry, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=321.74s)]
*  but it's sponsored by government. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  My friend Lord Layard has started a movement that promotes happiness. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  There's a great deal of that happening and I don't know how successful it is. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=335.74s)]
*  Because the criterion for evaluation, it's very difficult to conduct evaluations on those [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=340.94s)]
*  things, because people who know they've been subjected to interventions cannot really answer [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=346.78s)]
*  those questions honestly, or even if they try. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=352.46s)]
*  So the way to test whether things are successful would be to ask a person's friends, has he [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=356.78s)]
*  become, or she become happier? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=362.34s)]
*  And that hasn't been done. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=365.42s)]
*  And that people want to maximize their overall sense of how their life is gone. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=367.22s)]
*  Do you think that is ultimately Darwinian roots? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=371.1s)]
*  Or why is that the equilibrium? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=374.38000000000005s)]
*  Happiness feels good, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=376.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, happiness feels good in the moment. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=378.18s)]
*  But you know, it's in the moment. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=381.06s)]
*  What you're left with are your memories. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=382.42s)]
*  That's the very striking thing, that memories stay with you and the reality of life is gone [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=386.66s)]
*  in an instant. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=392.74s)]
*  So memory has a disproportionate weight because it's with us. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=395.06s)]
*  It stays with us. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=399.94s)]
*  It's the only thing we get to keep. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=401.14000000000004s)]
*  If you think of your own life, have you maximized happiness or the overall sense of how your [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  life has gone? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=408.14000000000004s)]
*  Neither. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=409.46000000000004s)]
*  Neither. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=410.46000000000004s)]
*  Citations? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=411.46000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  If you miss a flight due to a traffic jam outside your control, would you rather be two hours [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  late or just one minute late? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I'm like everybody else. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  I'd rather be two hours late. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  And you think even knowing about this doesn't change that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=428.46s)]
*  You can't talk yourself out of the bias. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=431.86s)]
*  You can talk yourself out of some biases, I think. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=434.14s)]
*  I mean, I wouldn't generalize on that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=437.34s)]
*  But it would take, you know, I could possibly talk myself out of that one by, you know, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=440.5s)]
*  by really sort of repeating to myself how stupid it is. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=446.86s)]
*  But it would take a lot of work. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=450.7s)]
*  It's not that you can decide once and for all, I will not be subject to that bias. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=453.1s)]
*  Doesn't work that way. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=458.94s)]
*  Do you think we over-invest or under-invest in memories overall? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=459.94s)]
*  We certainly invest heavily in memories. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=464.3s)]
*  I mean, you know, vacations, who many people are investment in the formation and maintenance [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=466.38s)]
*  of memories. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=474.1s)]
*  So there is a lot of investment, whether it's too much or too little. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=475.94s)]
*  It probably depends a lot on people's, on the amount of consumption of memory that people [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=480.18s)]
*  engage in. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=485.98s)]
*  So I, for one, I'm certainly biased, but I do not consume my memories a lot. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=486.98s)]
*  And I, you know, I almost never go back to photographs, not deliberately. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=493.38s)]
*  You know, if I stumble on something, it will move me. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=497.5s)]
*  But the idea of going back to relive a vacation, that's not what I do. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=500.3s)]
*  So I have little empathy for this. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=506.26s)]
*  And if we think about, say, sports, they're a form of bias, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=510.14s)]
*  Most people root for a home team or they root for their country in the Olympics. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=513.78s)]
*  Music arguably is a form of bias through soundtrack music. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=518.54s)]
*  It affects how you view the movie, even though it's not changing any facts. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=521.98s)]
*  To what extent should we think of bias as the main thing that gives our lives an overall [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=526.36s)]
*  structure, just as a musical soundtrack is what gives structure to a movie? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=531.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, that's a tendentious way of labeling things, to call them biases. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=535.5400000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't call the effect on music, you know, a biasing effect. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  It completes the experience. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=546.38s)]
*  So and what were your other examples? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=548.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, sports, you're consuming bias, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=551.14s)]
*  You don't actually think your team is better. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=554.58s)]
*  No, but you identify. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=556.9s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's not, there are emotions over which you have very little control. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=558.86s)]
*  But it's a fact that you feel pride when your team wins. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=564.22s)]
*  And in fact, you feel pride if a stranger who lives on your street gets a prize. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=567.58s)]
*  So that tendency to identify with what's around us and with things that that we are connected [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=572.82s)]
*  to is very powerful. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=579.6600000000001s)]
*  We derive a lot of emotion from it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=581.26s)]
*  And I wouldn't call that a bias because you can call any emotion a bias. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=583.98s)]
*  There's a well-known article by John List where he argues if you study how experts trade [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=588.82s)]
*  assets that a lot of what are called biases go away and become quite small. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=594.4200000000001s)]
*  What's your reaction to his research? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=600.34s)]
*  It's beautiful research. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=602.34s)]
*  I'm convinced it's right. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=604.1s)]
*  And indeed, you don't have to go as far as he does to find cases in which people act [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=606.38s)]
*  fairly rationally, but people act fairly rationally in routine transactions. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=612.5s)]
*  So if there is a thing that's loss aversion, that it plays a large role. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=617.9s)]
*  And that's list research in novices. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  They get attached to things and then they don't want to sell them. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=626.74s)]
*  And they get over it over time. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=631.3s)]
*  And in routine transactions, you know, when I go and I spend some money to get shoes, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=634.86s)]
*  I feel no loss aversion for the money. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=641.26s)]
*  Certainly, the person who sells me his shoes feels no loss aversion for the shoes. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=643.9s)]
*  It's a routine transaction. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=648.9s)]
*  And it's a whole domain in which loss aversion doesn't apply. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=650.38s)]
*  Much of your last book is about bias, of course, and much of your next book will be about noise. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=658.3s)]
*  If you think of actual mistakes in human decision making, how do you now see the relative weight [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=664.14s)]
*  of bias versus noise? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=669.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, I would say this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=671.02s)]
*  So first of all, let me explain what I mean by noise. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=673.34s)]
*  I mean, just randomness. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=675.9s)]
*  And it's true within individuals, but it's especially true among individuals who are [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=679.5s)]
*  supposed to be interchangeable in, say, organizations. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=686.7s)]
*  Can I spend three minutes to explain that? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=691.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=693.46s)]
*  So I'll tell you where, you know, the experiment from which my current fascination with noise [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=694.46s)]
*  arose. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=699.26s)]
*  I was working with an insurance company, and we did a very standard experiment. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=701.22s)]
*  They constructed cases, very routine standard cases, expensive cases. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=708.34s)]
*  We're not talking of insuring cars. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=713.86s)]
*  We're talking of insuring, you know, financial firms for risk of fraud. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=716.34s)]
*  But so you have people who are specialists in this. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=720.26s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=723.86s)]
*  So cases were constructed completely realistic. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=725.46s)]
*  The kind of thing that people encounter every day. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=728.58s)]
*  And you have 50 people reading a case and putting a dollar value on it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=732.82s)]
*  And now I could ask you, and I asked the executives in the firm, and it's a number on which just [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=738.82s)]
*  about everybody agrees. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=745.7s)]
*  So suppose you take two people at random, two underwriters at random, you average the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=747.5400000000001s)]
*  premium they set. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=755.22s)]
*  You take the difference between them and you divide the difference by the average. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=756.58s)]
*  So by what percentage do people differ? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=761.46s)]
*  Would you expect people to differ? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=765.38s)]
*  And there is a common answer that you find, you know, when I just talk to people and ask [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=767.5400000000001s)]
*  them, or the executives had the same answer. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=773.5400000000001s)]
*  It's somewhere around 10%. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  That's what people expect to see in a well-run firm. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=778.0200000000001s)]
*  Now, what we found was 50%, five zero. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  Which by the way, mean that those underwriters were absolutely wasting their time. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=785.54s)]
*  I mean, in the sense of assessing risk. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=790.74s)]
*  So that's noise. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=795.46s)]
*  And you find variability across individuals, which is not supposed to exist. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=797.86s)]
*  And you find variability within individual, depending morning, afternoon, hot, cold. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=803.94s)]
*  I mean, a lot of things influence the way that people make judgments. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=810.34s)]
*  Whether they are full or whether they've had lunch or haven't had lunch affects judges [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=814.1s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, it's hard to say what there is more of noise or bias, but one thing is very certain [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=822.66s)]
*  that bias has been overestimated at the expense of noise. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=828.9s)]
*  I mean, virtually all the literature and a lot of public conversation is about biases. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=834.98s)]
*  But in fact, noise is, I think, extremely important, very prevalent. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=841.14s)]
*  And there is an interesting fact that noise and bias are independent sources of error. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=846.74s)]
*  So that reducing either of them improves overall accuracy. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=852.66s)]
*  And so there is room for, and the procedures by which you would reduce bias and reduce [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=858.26s)]
*  noise are not the same. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=864.5s)]
*  So that's what I'm fascinated by these days. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=866.26s)]
*  Do you think of low intelligence as yet a third independent source of error, or is that [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=869.3s)]
*  somehow subsumed in bias and noise? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=874.42s)]
*  You mean plain stupidity? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=877.54s)]
*  In some cases, yeah. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=880.26s)]
*  It wouldn't really be necessarily the same as either bias or noise. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=882.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, getting inadequate information or not getting adequate information when it's [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=886.3399999999999s)]
*  available is a stupid thing to do and a very common thing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=894.26s)]
*  And it's not exactly a bias and it's not necessarily. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=897.86s)]
*  It would contribute more to noise than to bias, by the way, by and large. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=903.86s)]
*  When people collect too little information or are swayed by the first thing that comes to mind, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=908.58s)]
*  you get noise rather than bias. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=914.18s)]
*  And do you see the wisdom of crowds as a way of addressing noise in business firms? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=916.42s)]
*  So you take all the auditors and you somehow construct a weighted average? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=921.14s)]
*  Well, the wisdom of the crowds will work and pooling opinions will work when errors are [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=925.46s)]
*  independent. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=932.18s)]
*  That is, when everybody is inclined to make the same mistake, which is then a bias, then having [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=933.46s)]
*  multiple individuals engaged in it, if they share their biases, you'll get the bias. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=939.86s)]
*  It's going to be worsened and everybody will have much higher confidence in their bias views [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=944.8199999999999s)]
*  because other people share them. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=950.02s)]
*  So wisdom of the crowd works under quite specified conditions. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=952.1s)]
*  With respect to the underwriters, I would expect certainly that if you took 12 underwriters [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=956.98s)]
*  assessing the same risk, you would eliminate the noise. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=964.18s)]
*  You would be left with bias, but you would eliminate one source of error. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=967.54s)]
*  And the question is just price. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=972.02s)]
*  Google, for example, when it selects, when it hires people, they have a minimum of four [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=974.4200000000001s)]
*  individual making independent assessments of each candidate. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=981.7s)]
*  And that reduces the standard deviation of error, at least by a factor of two. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=986.74s)]
*  So is the business world in general adjusting for noise right now or only some highly successful [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=993.7s)]
*  firms? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=999.22s)]
*  You know, I don't know enough about that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1000.6s)]
*  All I do know is that when we pointed out the results, the bewildering results of the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  experiment on underwriters, and there was another unit, people who assessed the size of claims, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1010.2s)]
*  again, about actually it's more than 50%, like 58%. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1016.6s)]
*  The thing that were the most striking was that nobody in the organization had any idea [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  that this was going on. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1026.04s)]
*  So it took people completely by surprise. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1027.72s)]
*  So my guess now is that wherever people exercise judgment, there is noise. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1030.6000000000001s)]
*  And as a first rule, there is more noise than people expect. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1037.4s)]
*  And there is more noise than they can imagine, because it's very difficult to imagine that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1041.0s)]
*  people have a very different opinion from yours when your opinion is right, which it is. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1046.28s)]
*  So that's the way it works. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1052.04s)]
*  So if you're called in by a CEO to give advice, and I think sometimes you are, how can I reduce [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1055.96s)]
*  the noise in my decisions, the decisions of the CEO, when there's not a simple way to [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1061.8000000000002s)]
*  average the firm doesn't have a dozen CEOs? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1066.52s)]
*  What's your advice? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1069.0800000000002s)]
*  My advice is divide and conquer. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1070.52s)]
*  That is, there is one thing that we know that improves the quality of judgment, I think, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1073.3200000000002s)]
*  and this is to delay intuition. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1080.44s)]
*  Not, I think there is in the audience a friend of mine, Gary Klein, who is violently opposed [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1084.3600000000001s)]
*  to what I'm saying, but as are many others, but I'm here. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1089.4s)]
*  So I think delaying intuition is a very good idea and delaying intuition until the facts [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1094.68s)]
*  are in at hand and looking at the mentions of the problem separately and independently [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1103.16s)]
*  is just a better use of information. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1111.3200000000002s)]
*  And the problem with intuition is that it forms very quickly, so that you need to have [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1115.48s)]
*  special procedures in place to control it, except in those rare cases, and Gary Klein [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1121.16s)]
*  and others have demonstrated that, where you have intuitive expertise. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1128.52s)]
*  You know, that's true for athletes, you know, they respond intuitively, it's true for [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1134.76s)]
*  chess masters, it's true for fire fighters, captains, as Gary Klein has shown. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1140.92s)]
*  So that's intuitive expertise. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1147.08s)]
*  I don't think CEOs encounter many problems where they have intuitive expertise. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1149.32s)]
*  They haven't had the opportunity to acquire it. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1153.96s)]
*  So that better slow down. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1157.0s)]
*  And just take more time on each decision. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1159.32s)]
*  Break the decision up. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1161.96s)]
*  It's not so much a matter of time because you don't want people to get paralyzed by [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1163.48s)]
*  analysis, but it's a matter of planning how you're going to make the decision and making [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1167.64s)]
*  it in stages and not acting without an intuitive certainty that you're doing the right thing, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1173.88s)]
*  but just delay it until all the information is available. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1181.56s)]
*  And does noise play any useful roles either in businesses or in broader society, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1185.16s)]
*  or is it just a cost we would like to minimize? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1189.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, there is one condition under which noise is very useful and that if [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1192.6000000000001s)]
*  there is a selection process, you know, evolution works on noise. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1197.88s)]
*  So you have random variation and then selection. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1202.92s)]
*  But when there is no selection, noise is just a cost. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1205.96s)]
*  But say it were always transparent who would be the winners and who would be the losers [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1208.92s)]
*  from a given decision. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1212.6000000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't we be too emotional, too polarized, engaging in too much rent seeking and having [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1213.96s)]
*  an ambiguity as to cause and effect is in part what allows us to get along with each other? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1219.16s)]
*  I mean, you are sort of making a lot of assumptions I'm not used to in this question. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1224.2s)]
*  You seem to assume that, you know, there is something very competitive that could be alleviated. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1232.52s)]
*  But there's the old saying, say, from the Soviet Union that meritocracy is very hard [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1239.5600000000002s)]
*  to live under, that if you really know how many people are better than you are, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1243.8000000000002s)]
*  which say a chess player might do something psychologically oppressive to being downgraded. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1247.64s)]
*  Whereas noise, you can you can be overconfident more easily. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1253.8000000000002s)]
*  And we all know you don't need noise for that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1257.16s)]
*  You know, bias will do it for you. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1261.16s)]
*  And and there is a lot of bias in that direction. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1264.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, people clearly overestimate what they can do and how good they are. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1267.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's a blessing, undoubtedly. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1272.5200000000002s)]
*  Are there groups of people you feel are less subject to biases? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  So there's some papers, for instance, showing that autistics, they have weaker framing effects, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1279.0s)]
*  smaller endowment effects, maybe because top down processing works in a different way. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1283.88s)]
*  Do you have an opinion on that literature? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1288.68s)]
*  No, I don't know it well enough. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1290.8400000000001s)]
*  If you think of the literature on what are called cognitive disabilities, so ADHD, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1292.92s)]
*  do you think of that as bias or somehow in a different logical category or? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1297.8s)]
*  I mean, you know, I don't think it's a bias. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1302.6799999999998s)]
*  No, I think it's an attention deficit. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1304.76s)]
*  So it means that people are difficulty controlling their attention, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  focusing on what they want to focus on and staying focused. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1311.48s)]
*  That's neither bias nor noise. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1316.04s)]
*  You know, bias and noise do not cover the universe. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1318.12s)]
*  You know, there are other categories. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1320.9199999999998s)]
*  And if you think about the issue of when people think about the world, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1323.7199999999998s)]
*  they find some kind of transactions repugnant. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1327.08s)]
*  So sometimes they just don't like to sell what they have. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1330.44s)]
*  Other times they seem to object to markets, say in kidneys or kidney transplants. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1333.88s)]
*  Do you view that as bias or where does that come from? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1338.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, in the sense that this is a norm and, you know, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1342.6000000000001s)]
*  there are things that we're trained or socialized to find disgusting, to find repugnant. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1347.08s)]
*  And so there are repugnant transactions. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1353.32s)]
*  And, you know, you have to treat them as you treat every other moral feeling. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1357.32s)]
*  You know, we have lots of moral feelings, things that we find unacceptable [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1361.64s)]
*  without any ability to really explain why they're unacceptable. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1367.72s)]
*  There is such a thing as moral emotion. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1372.92s)]
*  There is such a thing as indignation, as moral disgust. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1375.16s)]
*  And that's what we're talking about here. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1379.56s)]
*  So you're pessimistic about the ability of psychologists [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1381.4s)]
*  to develop structural explanations of where feelings of repugnance come from. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1384.6s)]
*  Well, in some cases, we know. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1389.8s)]
*  And, you know, you can do that associatively. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1395.08s)]
*  I mean, it really depends on the associative structure that is imposed by a given culture. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1398.36s)]
*  So, you know, to give you a sense of the way that works, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1405.32s)]
*  there is psychologist Paul Rosen, who's done some brilliant experiments on that. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1408.04s)]
*  And in one of the experiments, he has people and they're given a glass of orange juice, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1412.92s)]
*  and they have a sticker, and they're asked to write on that sticker cyanide, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1419.8799999999999s)]
*  and to stick it on the juice, and then to drink the juice. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1424.52s)]
*  And they don't want to. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1427.3999999999999s)]
*  This is something, it's an emotion of which people have no control. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1431.8s)]
*  And our socialization has created those emotions in us. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1435.8s)]
*  And, you know, we're conditioned to have them under some conditions. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1440.04s)]
*  Other cultures are disgusted by other things. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1443.96s)]
*  Philip Tetlock has argued that if we set up long run tournaments with forecasting, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1447.32s)]
*  and we measure results, and we test teams against each other, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1452.2s)]
*  that we can in the longer run reduce, I think, both noise and bias. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1456.28s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1460.36s)]
*  And do you think there are factors he's overlooking in how his tournaments are set up? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1461.0s)]
*  I mean, Phil Tetlock is another friend, but he's also a hero. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1464.68s)]
*  I think this is beautiful research. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1469.8s)]
*  I think it's proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that when you have people making forecasts for [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1472.2s)]
*  the medium term, you know, up to six months in many situations, you can have people thinking [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1478.2s)]
*  carefully without any training who do better than CIA analysts. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1484.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, that's fundamentally what he has shown. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1490.76s)]
*  And he really knows why, or he knows how they do it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1494.52s)]
*  And the tricks are very simple. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1499.88s)]
*  I mean, you know, if you made a list of intelligent ways to go at problems, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
*  that's what people do. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1505.96s)]
*  So, you know, they view the problem as an instance of a category, and then they switch [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1507.0800000000002s)]
*  to looking at the problem from the inside. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1512.8400000000001s)]
*  And essentially, they adopt different points of view. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1515.48s)]
*  It's not the same thing as what I was saying earlier about breaking up [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1518.2s)]
*  problems into dimensions and averaging. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  There is no averaging, but there is looking at a problem from multiple dimensions and [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1526.4399999999998s)]
*  collecting a lot of information. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1530.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's basically what creates super forecasters. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1533.1599999999999s)]
*  So if you're picking the Daniel Kahneman super forecasting team, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1536.28s)]
*  what qualities are you looking for in individuals? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1540.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, Phil Tetlock really has a comprehensive list, which I'm not going to [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1543.24s)]
*  remember. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1548.9199999999998s)]
*  But at the margin, you know, would you modify? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1549.3999999999999s)]
*  They will be intelligent. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1551.56s)]
*  They will be numerate. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1552.84s)]
*  They will be open minded. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1554.52s)]
*  They'll be curious, interested in learning, eager to train their mind. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1556.04s)]
*  But is there a bias left in how Tetlockians pick their teams? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1560.76s)]
*  He picks the teams by results. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1564.28s)]
*  So what he has, he has people competing in making probabilistic forecasts of strategic [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1566.84s)]
*  or economic events in the medium and short term. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1575.6399999999999s)]
*  And some people are more accurate than others. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1578.9199999999998s)]
*  And after a year of that, you select the top 2% and you call them super forecasters. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1581.4s)]
*  And that gives them a very good feeling, you know, to be labeled super forecasters. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1588.3600000000001s)]
*  And they do not regress to the means. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1593.0s)]
*  There's the second year, they're just about as good at the first year. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1595.24s)]
*  That's the basic finding. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1599.0s)]
*  If you're picking doctors where maybe results are hard to measure in some cases, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1600.68s)]
*  what do you look for when selecting doctors in broad terms? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1605.16s)]
*  Well, you know, I will do the conventional thing. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1608.68s)]
*  I will ask about their reputation because that's the best, you know, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1612.2s)]
*  that's the best measure we have. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1616.44s)]
*  If it's a surgeon that I'm looking for, then there are real indices. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1618.28s)]
*  The main one being the number of times is performed the operation in question. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1623.8s)]
*  So that, you know, that you know, this is what you've got to examine [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1628.28s)]
*  because people really do get better over time. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1633.4s)]
*  And so measuring how much practice they've had. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1637.4s)]
*  And the practice is fairly specific on different operations. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1640.52s)]
*  So I think I would know how to pick a surgeon. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1644.04s)]
*  There's a good deal of evidence that people in businesses are overconfident. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1646.92s)]
*  But do you think they're more overconfident than they should be? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1650.68s)]
*  Well, overconfidence has many virtues. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1653.8s)]
*  I mean, you know, in the first place, it's nice. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1657.08s)]
*  I mean, it's pleasant to be overconfident, especially if you're an optimist. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1659.32s)]
*  I mean, optimism is valuable, much more than overconfidence. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1664.2s)]
*  Overconfidence is sort of a side effect. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1667.8s)]
*  But to exaggerate the odds of success is a very useful thing for people. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1671.08s)]
*  It will make them more appealing to others. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1678.28s)]
*  They will get more resources and they will take risks. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1680.68s)]
*  And it's not necessarily good for them. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1684.52s)]
*  The expected utility, you know, taking risks in the economy [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1688.36s)]
*  is probably marginally negative. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1695.3999999999999s)]
*  But for society as a whole to have a lot of optimists taking risks, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1698.36s)]
*  that's what makes for economic progress. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1703.08s)]
*  So I call that the engine of capitalism, really, that sort of optimism. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1705.6399999999999s)]
*  There's a collaboration between a human being and a machine. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1710.52s)]
*  And occasionally the human being overrides the machine. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1714.4399999999998s)]
*  Do you feel the human beings in those situations are on average [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1717.8799999999999s)]
*  either too overconfident or too optimistic? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1721.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, there are certain criteria that you would want to apply [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1724.36s)]
*  before you put a machine to work. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1728.9199999999998s)]
*  You want to validate that. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1733.32s)]
*  But once you have a machine making decisions, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1735.08s)]
*  the conditions under which it's a good idea for humans to override them [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1738.28s)]
*  are really well known and well understood. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1742.1999999999998s)]
*  And it's not that when you get a feeling that the machine is wrong, that's not enough. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1745.32s)]
*  I'll give you an example where it would be OK to override a machine. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1751.32s)]
*  So suppose you have a computer that approves loans. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1755.56s)]
*  And then you're the banker and you see that the person [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1760.92s)]
*  who was approved for a loan has just been arrested for fraud. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1764.12s)]
*  Then you will override the machine. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1768.12s)]
*  That's about the conditions under which it's worth it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1772.04s)]
*  Otherwise, there have been many experiments. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1774.92s)]
*  So do you side with the analysts such as Martin Ford, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1777.48s)]
*  who see really a very large number of jobs being potentially automatable [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1780.92s)]
*  with artificial intelligence, machine learning? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1786.04s)]
*  Or will we always need the human beings to work with the machines? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1788.3600000000001s)]
*  That we will need human beings is, I think, an illusion. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1792.04s)]
*  But I think that's a good point. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1796.84s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1798.76s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1799.96s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1801.32s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1802.44s)]
*  We will need human beings is, I think, an illusion. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1803.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's really very... [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1808.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, take chess, for example. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1810.28s)]
*  So Kasparov was beaten 20 years ago. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1813.08s)]
*  And he went on for a while, and it was true for a while, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1817.72s)]
*  saying that teams of chess players with grandmasters, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1821.24s)]
*  programs with grandmasters would be stronger than either. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1826.84s)]
*  And it was true for a while. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1831.48s)]
*  It is true no longer. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1833.8s)]
*  The programs do not need the grandmasters. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1835.72s)]
*  And you know how it happened, and it's likely to happen in many other fields. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1839.24s)]
*  I mean, it's happening in dermatology. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1844.92s)]
*  Dermatology, the diagnosis, is now better done by programs than by people, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1847.8s)]
*  and they are not going to need the person very often. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1855.72s)]
*  That is, to have a person intervene with the right to intervene, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1858.84s)]
*  they will sometimes correct mistakes, but they will more often, I think, introduce mistakes. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1863.0s)]
*  So when you have a well-running program, leave it alone. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1869.16s)]
*  So we as professors won't need to grade exams anymore, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1872.84s)]
*  and I don't just mean multiple choice. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1875.64s)]
*  You run machine learning on papers. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1877.4s)]
*  You find what correlates with the good paper. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1879.24s)]
*  You put the paper through the program. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1881.56s)]
*  Look, I mean, the point is there is so much noise in essay grading [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1883.96s)]
*  that it's quite easy to imagine a program that would look at various indices [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1888.52s)]
*  and that would do better than, you know, hurried and tired professors. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1893.56s)]
*  If you consider people working in psychology or maybe economics or just social sciences, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1899.8s)]
*  do you think people persist with their professional and research projects [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1905.56s)]
*  too long or not long enough? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1909.3200000000002s)]
*  Where's the bias? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1911.64s)]
*  My guess is too long, but you know, it's a personal bias. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1912.92s)]
*  Because of some costs. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1916.2s)]
*  Because of some costs. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1917.4s)]
*  And I think some costs is really the enemy when you're doing research, to innovative research. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1918.52s)]
*  You ought to recognize that something isn't working and just move on. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1925.72s)]
*  And you know, there are different views on that, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1929.8000000000002s)]
*  but my sense is that this is the direction of the bias, you know, some costs. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1932.1200000000001s)]
*  Michael Nielsen, who's a scientist and he works at Y Combinator, he tweeted today, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1937.3200000000002s)]
*  If it weren't for sunk costs and my respect for them, I wouldn't ever get anything done. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1942.6s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1947.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, you know, some things. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1950.36s)]
*  It keeps you at things, right? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1951.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it keeps you at things. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1952.52s)]
*  You stay loyal to your friends, you become more trustworthy. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1953.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's not, you know, when we talk about some costs, we talk about something else. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1956.76s)]
*  So it is not true that growing attachment to things that you're familiar with [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1962.36s)]
*  and that you like and love and increasingly trust, you know, that's not sunk costs. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1968.92s)]
*  That's something else. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1975.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, sunk costs is a fairly specific thing. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1976.6000000000001s)]
*  That is, that you are putting a different value on a move or an investment that you make [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1980.28s)]
*  because of investment that you have already made. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1987.3200000000002s)]
*  Then you would if you were looking at that de novo. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1991.0s)]
*  And sunk costs, by and large, I think, are a negative. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1994.04s)]
*  We know that, you know, when you get a new CEO in place in organizations, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=1998.04s)]
*  the new CEO has one big advantage. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2004.28s)]
*  He's got no sunk costs with respect to poor ideas that had, you know, that the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2007.1599999999999s)]
*  exiting CEO had and couldn't let go of. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2014.84s)]
*  If you had a perfectly rational, pure Bayesian, would anyone else trust that person? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2019.08s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, would he be nice? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2023.8s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2025.96s)]
*  You know, that's what would matter. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2028.44s)]
*  I don't think, you know, if you could get me a nice Bayesian, that would be fine. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2030.76s)]
*  Some questions about psychologists outside of what you've worked on, but may be related. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2036.76s)]
*  Freud, what do you think of Freud's body of work and has it influenced you at all? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2042.04s)]
*  Well, if I think of Freud's two principles of mental functioning, right, the notion of [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2046.92s)]
*  pleasure principle, reality principle. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2051.88s)]
*  It's a little bit like thinking fast and slow in some ways with big differences. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2054.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, all dichotomies are alike, you know, in some ways. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2058.92s)]
*  And yeah, you know, there are similarities. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2065.0s)]
*  Oddly enough, there is one aspect of Freudian work that I think did influence me. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2067.96s)]
*  And he has, for some reason, when I was a graduate student, it's too long a story, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2074.12s)]
*  but I was exposed to chapter seven in the interpretation of dreams. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2079.0s)]
*  And I spent a summer studying chapter seven of the interpretation of dreams. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2084.2s)]
*  And in chapter seven, there is basically a theory of attention. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2089.72s)]
*  And like 25 years later, I published a theory of attention. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2094.68s)]
*  And when it was done, I realized that it resembled chapter seven, you know, quite a bit. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2098.76s)]
*  So, yes. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2105.16s)]
*  Personality psychology and five factor personality theory. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2106.36s)]
*  Is that for you a useful way of thinking about human beings? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2110.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, it's a proven way of thing. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2113.32s)]
*  It's sort of boring. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2116.28s)]
*  But and I mean that seriously, this five factor thing, you know, that's about 20 years old, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2118.76s)]
*  and it dominates personality psychology because it works. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2126.1200000000003s)]
*  But it's better. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2129.88s)]
*  And it's sort of, you know, it used to be more exciting to have more complicated [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2131.24s)]
*  mechanism, but you have something that seems to work. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2137.0s)]
*  What did you draw from Herbert Simon? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2140.68s)]
*  Directly, nothing. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2143.16s)]
*  Indirectly, a lot. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2146.2799999999997s)]
*  And retrospectively, a lot. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2148.8399999999997s)]
*  What I mean by indirectly is that, you know, the air I breathe was influenced by Herbert Simon. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2151.64s)]
*  You know, he had the notion of heuristics, and it was in the language. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2159.0s)]
*  And it affected me, of course, it affected the whole zeitgeist. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2163.56s)]
*  It affected the whole culture. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2167.48s)]
*  And retrospectively, when I learned Simon, but you know, but that was after I was in the field [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2169.56s)]
*  and after I had made some contributions to the field, I discovered that I was following [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2176.2s)]
*  in his footsteps. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2180.92s)]
*  But, you know, that's not what I had been doing. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2182.04s)]
*  Originally, I hadn't viewed myself and in fact, I wasn't following in his footsteps. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2185.16s)]
*  Retrospectively, you find, oh yeah, this is what I did, you know, in the historical perspective. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2190.28s)]
*  And also from classical psychology, either Jung or Piaget, did you draw anything from them? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2195.56s)]
*  Or is that just a foreign stream? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2201.0s)]
*  Yeah, just completely foreign. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2203.24s)]
*  Completely foreign. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2205.16s)]
*  If you think about your early work on vision and on Israeli bus drivers, how did your later [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2206.2s)]
*  work on biases and thinking fast, thinking slow come out of your very earliest papers? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2212.44s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2217.64s)]
*  It was a completely separate thing. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2218.6s)]
*  I worked originally on a concept for quite a few years on the notion of effort, mental effort. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2220.84s)]
*  And when I started work on heuristics and biases with Amos Tversky, that wasn't on our mind, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2228.44s)]
*  and it had very little effect. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2235.64s)]
*  When I wrote Thinking Fast and Slow, like 10 years ago when I was doing that, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2237.96s)]
*  then it turned out that I put together, you know, all my life's work. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2243.0s)]
*  And the early work did get into thinking fast and slow, but it had no effect on my work with Amos [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2246.92s)]
*  Tversky. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2253.4s)]
*  But the idea of attention switching costs, so Israeli bus drivers, it takes time for them to [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2254.2000000000003s)]
*  switch attention from one event to another. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2259.56s)]
*  Is that not an underlying micro foundation of your, say, 1980s papers on bias? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2262.68s)]
*  That people aren't switching their attention to the new problem? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2268.92s)]
*  No. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2271.8s)]
*  It's not. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2273.64s)]
*  We didn't think of it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2274.68s)]
*  That really happens a great deal, and quite often it happens in a different way. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2276.6s)]
*  It happens when somebody is insulted because you didn't cite him. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2280.52s)]
*  And so, you know, he looks at your work and he says, that's just the same as what I've said [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2283.96s)]
*  before. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2288.92s)]
*  But, and in some way it may be true, there may be some resemblance, but it may be true, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2289.88s)]
*  and yet you were completely uninfluenced by that. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2295.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's the same thing. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2298.1200000000003s)]
*  I was uninfluenced by my earlier work, I think. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2299.32s)]
*  Now, your basic distinction between System 1 and System 2, thinking fast and thinking slow, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2302.76s)]
*  to the extent that particular results do not replicate, do you view that as undercutting [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2308.1200000000003s)]
*  the System 1 versus System 2 distinction, or is that immune to the degree of replicability? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2313.4s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, there were whole sets of results that I published in thinking [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2318.92s)]
*  fast and slow, but I wish I hadn't published because they're then not reliable. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2325.08s)]
*  Whether it undercuts the idea of two systems is really anchored in a basic sort of fact of [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2331.88s)]
*  experience, that the process by which, you know, you get two plus two is fundamentally [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2340.12s)]
*  different from the way that you get 17 by 24. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2348.8399999999997s)]
*  And so, one of them happens automatically, associatively, quickly, you have no control. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2353.48s)]
*  The other demands effort and is slow and so on. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2359.64s)]
*  That's immune to replication. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2362.68s)]
*  But if there's a bias in individuals and noise, why should we trust our experience about [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2364.76s)]
*  this apparent sense of having two methods? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2371.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's not only, well, in the first place, those are extremes. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2373.1600000000003s)]
*  It doesn't mean that there aren't others. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2380.84s)]
*  It doesn't mean that there is not a continuum. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2382.76s)]
*  But there is at least a continuum to be explored of those two extremes. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2386.0400000000004s)]
*  That I'm quite confident. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2391.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you think that working outside of your native language in any way has influenced [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2392.76s)]
*  your ideas on psychology? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2396.92s)]
*  It makes you more aware of thinking fast versus thinking slow or not? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2398.5200000000004s)]
*  It's something I used to think about in the context, you know, I'm from Israel, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2402.36s)]
*  and it was thinking whether there was something in common to Israeli intellectuals operating [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2406.6000000000004s)]
*  in the inner second language. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2413.96s)]
*  And I thought that in a way, it can be an advantage to operate in a second language, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2416.28s)]
*  that there are certain things that you can think about the thing itself, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2421.8s)]
*  not through the words. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2427.32s)]
*  It's like lower sunk costs in a way. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2429.8s)]
*  I don't know exactly how to explain it, but I haven't been, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2432.36s)]
*  I thought that this was not a loss for me to do psychology in a second language. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2437.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you have thoughts on the potential cognitive advantages of bilingualism or trilingualism? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2443.32s)]
*  You know, it's an empirical matter. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2448.28s)]
*  It's not a matter of thinking, and I don't know enough. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2449.72s)]
*  It appears to be advantageous, but I don't know the literature. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2452.7599999999998s)]
*  If we think of therapists, psychiatrists, internists, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2456.2s)]
*  who are trying somehow to fix, improve, or cure people, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2459.72s)]
*  are they under-investing in a knowledge of what might be called behavioral economics [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2463.08s)]
*  or your work on psychology? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2468.52s)]
*  Should they be using more of it? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2470.12s)]
*  Is that their bias? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2471.64s)]
*  I have an opinion on that, and I think it is supported by evidence. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2473.0s)]
*  But there is one line of therapy that clearly works, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2479.24s)]
*  and it's evidence-based, and it's supported time and again, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2483.3999999999996s)]
*  and that is one style and it's cognitive behavioral therapy. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2487.3199999999997s)]
*  That works, and we know it does. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2491.16s)]
*  Other things work, and we don't, some of them do, some of them don't, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2494.12s)]
*  and it's primarily seems to depend on the personality of the therapist [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2498.4399999999996s)]
*  and on the interaction between the personality of the therapist [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2503.16s)]
*  and the personality of the patient. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2506.68s)]
*  Whereas cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2509.24s)]
*  and it's a technique that works. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2512.6s)]
*  So that's a fact, and the rest is a lot of bias. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2514.7599999999998s)]
*  And a society such as Argentina that relies so heavily on psychoanalysis, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2519.3999999999996s)]
*  as a psychologist, do you see that as bias? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2524.3599999999997s)]
*  Is it a placebo? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2527.8799999999997s)]
*  Is there a placebo effect on psychoanalysis? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2528.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, you seem to attribute, you seem to think that they think of bias all the time. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2531.56s)]
*  You know, it's like, I can't imagine why that's my bias. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2536.52s)]
*  I really don't think of bias that much, but you know, if you want to apply it, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2539.32s)]
*  then clearly there is a lot of psychoanalysis in Argentina, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2545.08s)]
*  and you know, there's no indication that it makes them more sane. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2549.96s)]
*  If you were to express, what is the question about gender [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2558.2s)]
*  and your own work that interests you the most? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2563.16s)]
*  Maybe you've never done it, but what would that be? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2565.48s)]
*  Because I have really never been interested in anything to do with gender. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2569.2400000000002s)]
*  So I have never studied, looked at differences between gender [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2575.08s)]
*  and the kind of research we did. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2579.96s)]
*  I've never been very interested in individual differences, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2581.72s)]
*  and not in gender either, so I don't know. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2586.28s)]
*  So it's the means really that interest you the most? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2589.56s)]
*  It's, yeah, it's the means and it's some extremes, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2592.84s)]
*  but it's not, you know, cutting and dicing into categories. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2597.2400000000002s)]
*  Being an Israeli, and surely you've traveled to many, many countries, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2602.1200000000003s)]
*  at the very least Sweden, right, among others. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2605.1600000000003s)]
*  There are papers on cross-cultural differences in bargaining or in decision biases. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2607.88s)]
*  How much stock do you put in those results? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2613.32s)]
*  Oh, I mean, I think there's no question that there are cultural differences. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2615.32s)]
*  For one thing, for example, there are major cultural differences [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2620.2s)]
*  in the attitude to optimism. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2624.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean, in quite a few European countries, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2628.12s)]
*  optimism is considered rather foolish. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2632.52s)]
*  You know, it's for children. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2635.08s)]
*  And in the United States, optimism is clearly a desirable trait. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2636.3599999999997s)]
*  And similarly, there are differences on whether risk-taking is considered [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2643.72s)]
*  a good thing or a bad thing. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2648.12s)]
*  And so there are certainly cultural differences. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2649.96s)]
*  And do you think of those in functionalist terms? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2652.76s)]
*  So some people might argue, well, Israelis, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2654.92s)]
*  they have a tendency to speak directly because [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2657.56s)]
*  they've had a lot of crisis situations where you can't beat around the bush. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2660.6s)]
*  You need to say what you think or we don't know. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2663.64s)]
*  I don't like those kinds of explanations. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2666.44s)]
*  They look, you know, facile to me. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2670.36s)]
*  Right now in psychology, in your own work, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2673.08s)]
*  what are the open questions you're most interested in? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2675.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, like, you know, like everybody else, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2677.96s)]
*  I think, like many others, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2681.56s)]
*  there are two exciting developments now that one would want to know about. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2683.64s)]
*  I mean, one would want to know how the brain works [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2687.88s)]
*  or to know more about how the brain works than we do. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2690.6s)]
*  And what would want to know about artificial intelligence [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2694.12s)]
*  and when it and if, when and how it will become more human-like [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2699.2400000000002s)]
*  in what it can do. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2706.36s)]
*  And you're optimistic on that front or? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2708.04s)]
*  I'm optimistic on virtually nothing. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2711.16s)]
*  But, you know, that AI is developing faster than anybody could have anticipated. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2715.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2720.68s)]
*  And so if it continues to develop at that rate, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2722.2799999999997s)]
*  meaning a lot faster than we expect, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2726.44s)]
*  then things are going to happen relatively quickly. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2729.64s)]
*  And what do you think are the main obstacles? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2733.56s)]
*  So some people in Silicon Valley will argue AI is stuck at a kind of local optimum. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2735.56s)]
*  Driverless cars, although they're ahead of the pace we thought 10 years ago, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2740.44s)]
*  they're maybe behind the pace we thought two years ago. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2744.04s)]
*  There's always a problem with emergency situations, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2747.0s)]
*  a policeman waving you on. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2750.44s)]
*  The last 1% maybe is very, very difficult. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2752.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I can't evaluate that. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2755.4s)]
*  That's a technical problem. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2758.2s)]
*  How long it will take to get to clean up the last 1%. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2759.88s)]
*  The question that I have interest as a psychologist is, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2763.7999999999997s)]
*  when can you simulate common sense? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2767.24s)]
*  When, you know, there is the really serious question that people raise about computers [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2770.52s)]
*  is whether they know what they're talking about, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2776.6s)]
*  you know, whether they understand what they're talking about. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2778.7599999999998s)]
*  And without sense organs and without the perceptual apparatus that we have [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2781.72s)]
*  and the ability to cause things by acting on the world, they can't be exactly like us. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2788.3599999999997s)]
*  But that sense of understanding, nobody actually today would, I think, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2795.9599999999996s)]
*  claim that even the most sophisticated programs have it. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2803.3999999999996s)]
*  And do you think we've learned anything general about common sense [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2807.64s)]
*  by having some artificial intelligence? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2810.3599999999997s)]
*  What we have learned is that our basic ideas about what's difficult and what's easy, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2812.68s)]
*  what's going to be simple and what's going to have undergone a series of sort of revolutionary [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2817.72s)]
*  changes. So we used to think that perception would be easy and thinking would be difficult. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2824.04s)]
*  Turns out that thinking was relatively easy and perception was difficult. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2831.8799999999997s)]
*  Now there are ways of handling perceptual problems and so thinking is difficult again. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2836.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's a very interesting, developing thing. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2842.04s)]
*  – Moving the chess piece is often harder than figuring out the best move for the program. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2846.84s)]
*  Looking back on your collaboration with Amos Tversky, which has been written about widely, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2851.72s)]
*  of course, there's the famous Michael Lewis book. But what is there about that collaboration [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2856.52s)]
*  or about Amos that you feel one could read everything that's out there, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2860.84s)]
*  but still has been underappreciated or undervalued? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2865.32s)]
*  – I mean, so much has been written that I couldn't point out to anything that people [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2868.6000000000004s)]
*  have completely ignored. It was just actually the thing that when I think about him, it was [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2873.4s)]
*  the mental energy, just the joy of thinking and the mental energy. And that made him very [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2880.92s)]
*  charismatic. And he was also very funny. And being funny is a major asset in social life. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2889.32s)]
*  And it turned out to be a major asset in our work because our work, our joint work, had a touch of [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2898.44s)]
*  irony to it. And the fact that we were laughing continuously as we were doing the work was very [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2905.0800000000004s)]
*  important to the nature of what we did. – And that stimulates discovery. It breaks down [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2911.88s)]
*  some cost bias or what does it do in formal terms? – I mean, what it does is it makes you look for [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2916.52s)]
*  funny things about the, for us, what it did for us. I can't generalize. For us, we were examining [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2923.56s)]
*  our own thinking and finding stupid things in our own thinking and finding that delightful [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2931.4s)]
*  and very funny. So we were very lucky in our choice of topic in many ways, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2937.96s)]
*  our choice of topic lent itself to a lot of things that are virtually impossible in other fields. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2945.8s)]
*  – And your current collaborators on The Noise Book, how would you describe that collaboration [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2952.76s)]
*  and tell us who they are? – Well, one of them is Cass Sunstein, who is a very famous jurist [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2957.48s)]
*  and also known for writing like three or four books a year. So he writes very easily and I [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2963.48s)]
*  write with difficulty. And so it's not an accident that we teamed up. And the other [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2969.72s)]
*  collaborator is a brilliant Frenchman that you haven't heard of. He was for 25 years at McKinsey [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2977.0s)]
*  and he became a director of McKinsey. And then he got bored with that and he got a PhD and he [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2983.72s)]
*  teaches and he is just extraordinary. So I'm very lucky. – And what will the main theme of that book [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2989.3199999999997s)]
*  be? – Well, it will be that noise is an underestimated problem. And it will be that [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=2995.8s)]
*  there is something deep about two ways of thinking that I was working on in thinking fast and slow, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3005.6400000000003s)]
*  which I called statistical versus causal. And noise is clearly a statistical way of looking at things. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3012.6800000000003s)]
*  And bias is inherently causal. And so the interplay of those forms of thinking, and then the idea [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3021.88s)]
*  that if you want to reduce noise, we have a pretty good idea of what you should do [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3032.2000000000003s)]
*  in order to induce greater uniformity, to overcome the vulnerability of people to [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3040.36s)]
*  all sorts of irrelevant influences. – And when will that book be out? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3048.44s)]
*  – Who knows? It was supposed to be out in the fall of 2020. And I think our publishers [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3052.28s)]
*  just remembered that there is going to be a presidential election at that time and that [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3061.7200000000003s)]
*  probably a lot of other more interesting books are going to be appearing. And so that postponed it to [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3066.68s)]
*  spring 2021. – We now have some time for questions, but Daniel Kahneman, thank you very much. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3073.08s)]
*  – I have my hearing aid on, but if I can't hear the question, you'll repeat. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3082.36s)]
*  – I will repeat, but people will go up to the mics. There are mics on each side. I will call on you. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3085.56s)]
*  And please, questions only. This is our chance to hear from Danny Kahneman. If you start making [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3092.2799999999997s)]
*  a long speech or statement, I will cut you off. And I also have questions from the iPad. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3098.12s)]
*  So please get in line if you would like to start with the questions here. First question, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3104.52s)]
*  could prediction markets reduce both bias and noise? – Well, noise certainly, but then [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3111.56s)]
*  averaging does it. And whether prediction markets consistently beat averaging is, I think, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3119.7999999999997s)]
*  not yet fully established. Bias, no. If there is a general bias, unless the people who are unbiased [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3126.36s)]
*  also know that they are unbiased, I mean, unless they have a way of being sure so that they can [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3137.0s)]
*  invest more than others and move the price toward the correct answer. But without that, without, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3143.4s)]
*  let's say, symmetry of knowledge, if there is a bias, it would not go in being, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3151.8s)]
*  it won't be reduced. Noise will be reduced. – First question, over here. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3156.92s)]
*  – Good evening. I have two questions, but they're short. My first question is, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3161.6400000000003s)]
*  you briefly talked about moral emotions. Do you see any benefit to shame? Because I've read [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3167.2400000000002s)]
*  conflicting theories there. So the moral emotion of shame in your thoughts. And two, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3173.96s)]
*  what is the impact of counterfactual thinking on happiness in your study? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3179.32s)]
*  – Oh, about shame, I really have no idea. You know, it's there. So I don't, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3183.6400000000003s)]
*  should one wish that it weren't, it's probably a force that induces better behavior in lots of [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3192.44s)]
*  people who would not be controlled in other ways. So I don't know how important or how useful it is. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3198.92s)]
*  It's painful to the people who feel it, and it might be useful to others who might be affected [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3207.64s)]
*  by bad behavior. As for counterfactuals and happiness, I think that what you refer to, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3213.64s)]
*  there are counterfactual emotions. Regret is a counterfactual emotion. Guilt is a counterfactual [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3220.3599999999997s)]
*  emotion. And you can ask in the sense that they are driven by something that didn't happen, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3228.3599999999997s)]
*  that could have happened, but didn't. And some of these emotions seem to be completely superfluous, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3236.68s)]
*  like regret. And I think people, by and large, would be better off without regret. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3243.8799999999997s)]
*  But it may also be, I mean, notice what regret is. Regret is what happens the next morning. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3255.16s)]
*  And, you know, if we didn't have it, then who knows what we might do. So. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3263.2400000000002s)]
*  Next question over here. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3270.36s)]
*  Yes, sir. On this topic of delaying intuition, and I'm delighted that Mr. Klein is in the audience [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3271.88s)]
*  because I spent over a decade myself as an intuitive expert and found myself mostly using [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3277.1600000000003s)]
*  recognition-primed decision-making. And I'm curious how much you think availability bias, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3281.96s)]
*  confirmation bias, et cetera, was still affecting my recognition-primed decision-making? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3288.2s)]
*  And is recognition-primed decision-making still useful? Is it just the best option [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3293.16s)]
*  in a temporally constrained environment? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3298.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, you know, I think obviously recognition-primed decision-making is going to be wonderful if people [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3300.3599999999997s)]
*  really can recognize things accurately. So if they can diagnose the situation accurately, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3310.2799999999997s)]
*  and do it quickly, and act intuitively on that basis, then of course it's beneficial. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3317.64s)]
*  And there are conditions with the supplies. Gary Klein and I became friends over a period of six [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3323.96s)]
*  years when we were trying to find out what are the boundaries. I mean, you know, I'm sort of a critic [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3332.68s)]
*  of intuition, and he is very much in favor of intuition, of expert intuition. And we were trying [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3339.08s)]
*  to find out, you know, what are the boundaries, because it's clear that sometimes intuition is [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3346.6s)]
*  wonderful and sometimes it's awful. And we ended up with a fairly obvious set of conclusions about [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3351.96s)]
*  what it is. You're going to have Gary Klein type intuition, expert intuition, if you have a regular [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3360.52s)]
*  world. That's condition number one. There are regularities that you can pick up. And if you [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3368.2799999999997s)]
*  have a lot of experience and if the feedback is rapid and unequivocal, and if you have those three [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3374.12s)]
*  conditions, which are true for chess players and they're true for spouses recognizing the emotion [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3383.3199999999997s)]
*  of their spouse on the telephone, to give you a completely different example, then intuition will [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3390.68s)]
*  develop and it will be perfect. If those conditions do not develop, I don't think that we can trust [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3397.32s)]
*  people who say that they're experts. Another iPad question. Tech entrepreneur Daniel Gross [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3404.36s)]
*  suggested that growing up in Israel was a forcing function for the tech sector. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3410.44s)]
*  How much was Israel a forcing function for your thinking? I don't really completely understand the [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3415.0800000000004s)]
*  term forcing function in this context. I know that Israel afforded many opportunities when I was [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3422.12s)]
*  growing up and it probably still does. I grew up very early in the history of Israel when the state [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3433.0s)]
*  was small and everyone could make a difference. And you really could make a difference. I mean, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3440.12s)]
*  I was as a lieutenant in the army age 21 or 22, I made a difference. I created an interviewing [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3445.56s)]
*  system for the whole army. So those kinds of experiences that you can do things and that [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3454.6s)]
*  seemed impossible or unlikely, that is certainly very liberating and encouraging and induces [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3461.88s)]
*  creativity. And I think some of that is actually present now that the state is bigger and more [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3469.0s)]
*  established. I see it, I think I was telling you earlier, how my grandson in the Israeli army, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3475.48s)]
*  the kinds of experiences that he has as a sergeant, he feels very free, you know, in an intelligence [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3482.2s)]
*  unit. He feels that he can use his mind and he can speak his mind and it's going to be wonderful [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3490.68s)]
*  for his future. Next question over here. You mentioned earlier that you view many things in [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3497.64s)]
*  the world through a basic lens of pessimism. But if you were going to challenge yourself to identify [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3503.7999999999997s)]
*  something going on in the world now, or in the near term, about which to be optimistic, if not [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3509.08s)]
*  for yourself, for your grandchildren, say, or very young people, what should they be optimistic about? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3514.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to pass over here. I'm curious about what beliefs you currently hold that you think [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3519.88s)]
*  in the next five to 10 years might be proven incorrect and alternatively the same question [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3529.8s)]
*  of social science broadly. Well, you know, if I knew how I would change my mind, I would have [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3534.76s)]
*  changed my mind. So my guess is that there will be completely different frameworks. There will be [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3542.04s)]
*  different ways of thinking. It's not going to be this or that detail. It's going to be, and this is [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3550.04s)]
*  what happens to ideas or to frameworks. They at some point become irrelevant. This is, you know, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3557.32s)]
*  and I know that this is going to happen to everything that I believe that, you know, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3565.8s)]
*  give it a few decades, it's going to be irrelevant. And I wish I, you know, I wish I could peer into [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3570.76s)]
*  the future and know what comes next. But, you know, I can't. From the iPad, why did the replication [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3578.0400000000004s)]
*  crisis take so long to arrive in social psychology? I would question that. It didn't take very long. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3584.92s)]
*  I mean, the replication crisis started, was studied first in medicine and where there were [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3591.0800000000004s)]
*  provocative claims by Stanford. I don't know, he's not a statistician, is he? There were [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3598.12s)]
*  provocative claims that most published research in medicine are false, and it started there. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3606.68s)]
*  And then psychology came very soon after. I mean, and in fact, psychology is considered to have been [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3613.24s)]
*  quite rapid in adopting it. And there was a crisis and many results were questioned, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3619.8s)]
*  I think, correctly. They were aggressors and they were defenders and both sides, I think, behaved [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3628.28s)]
*  quite often quite badly. But the result in psychology, and it's amazing, within a decade, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3636.76s)]
*  psychology has changed. Many areas of psychology have changed and it clearly is a better science [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3645.16s)]
*  than it was 10 years ago because of the replication crisis. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3652.12s)]
*  Next question. I have two questions. The first one is the one that you just answered. Not exactly [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3656.68s)]
*  the same, Mr. What do you think about the replication crisis in psychology that is happening [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3661.96s)]
*  recently? And the second one is the psychologist, Martin Seligman, who is also working on happiness [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3666.6s)]
*  for years, and he believes there are several dimensions that consist of happiness. Do you [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3674.6s)]
*  share the same opinion or not? The second question was Martin Seligman, his work [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3680.44s)]
*  on happiness, that there were several dimensions of happiness. Do you share his opinion or not? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3687.0s)]
*  And the first was just more on the replication crisis. No. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3692.04s)]
*  Next question over here. I have a question about [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3698.6800000000003s)]
*  bounder rationality over time. With the rise of the internet, the rise of more readily available [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3701.56s)]
*  information, you have so many prices, things that you can see on Amazon, all this price discrimination [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3707.24s)]
*  and differentiation across products has grown with that. Do you think that people's biases [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3714.52s)]
*  are improving or getting worse over time as more information, for example, over the past 20, 30 [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3720.92s)]
*  years has become more readily available? Well, I mean, to the extent that you think of biases [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3726.92s)]
*  as representing human nature in a broad cultural context, it hasn't changed over the last 30 years. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3733.8s)]
*  Human nature hasn't changed. In certain domains, it's much easier to be rational when you can look [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3741.48s)]
*  things up. So when you can search on the computer instead of going out and searching, as you had to [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3748.6s)]
*  when I was a young person, then of course, you can achieve more rational results than you could. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3756.04s)]
*  But whether it has changed anything significant, I doubt it. And what is very striking over the [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3762.92s)]
*  last few years is that it's not only information that is readily available, its misinformation is [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3770.84s)]
*  also readily available. So the net effect, you know, it used to be very clear that this is all [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3776.92s)]
*  to the good. But what we're seeing in the last few years is that there is a very heavy cost to [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3783.08s)]
*  the availability and the ease of expression that transmits itself over the internet. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3788.84s)]
*  Next question. I'm aware that I suffer from biases and I try to hold myself to account [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3797.48s)]
*  and think better. And I'm resistant to that, of course, because I always want to think that [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3802.84s)]
*  whatever thought I'm having at the moment is the exception and I'm thinking for good reasons. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3808.04s)]
*  But I fight against that. When I'm trying to persuade somebody else to listen to one of my [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3812.2799999999997s)]
*  opinions with an open mind, is there some particular technique that you would recommend for [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3816.2s)]
*  persuading other people to do battle with their own biases? Because of course, they're even more [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3822.52s)]
*  resistant to that than I am when I challenge myself. You know, it's a game one primarily [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3827.88s)]
*  plays with one's spouse. And it doesn't work, I think. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3833.96s)]
*  Related question from the iPad. How can we use behavioral economics [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3842.84s)]
*  to reduce political polarization? It's not that I have an answer and I'm suppressing it. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3847.0s)]
*  Here is a topic where I'm optimistic, but I have no idea. You know, I don't have an answer. But I [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3852.52s)]
*  think the kind of thinking that is going on where you're trying to look at practical [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3858.92s)]
*  manipulations that can be... The word manipulation is a bad word, but I intended it as a good thing. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3865.48s)]
*  When you look at practical moves that can make a difference in the way that people think, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3873.8s)]
*  that way of thinking should be effective in improving the quality of life [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3879.96s)]
*  and improving the quality of... How polarization can be reduced is too big a problem [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3887.64s)]
*  for me and I think currently for behavioral economics. Next question. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3895.08s)]
*  On a practical note, my high school psychology students ask how they can best use your research [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3900.04s)]
*  to make choices about college and career. I mean, that's not my research. Absolutely [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3904.84s)]
*  nothing to this. There are sensible ways of choosing colleges and I think they're well known [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3910.76s)]
*  and you have to collect a lot of information and you have to ask yourself what the student really [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3918.5200000000004s)]
*  wants and where he or she will really fit. And so there are obvious ways of doing this. I have [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3924.6000000000004s)]
*  nothing to add. But say you have a student who has a gut feeling that he or she ought to go to some [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3931.48s)]
*  college for a reason he or she cannot articulate. Are you telling us they should dismiss that feeling [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3936.2s)]
*  and defer to the algorithm? I would try to probe and understand where does that feeling come from. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3942.04s)]
*  I mean, I don't think... Are you asking me as a parent, say, or as an imagined parent? I would [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3950.3599999999997s)]
*  really probe. I would feel free. If that's a very expensive college and strong... I think I would [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3957.0s)]
*  feel free to probe. Where does that strong wish come from? And can we discuss it? Next question. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3964.04s)]
*  So many behavioral economists use the notion of rationality and neoclassical economics as [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3972.92s)]
*  a normative benchmark and you have said that you don't think that's necessarily a good normative [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3978.44s)]
*  benchmark and instead something like reasonableness is a better way to think about those things. Could [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3984.12s)]
*  you say more about how we might identify or define and identify this reasonableness? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3990.68s)]
*  The rational agent models are built on the notion of consistency being the one guiding principle. So [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=3996.68s)]
*  your beliefs and your preferences have to be internally consistent. Nobody can tell you what [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4006.52s)]
*  to believe. Nobody can tell you what you want. But your beliefs and... The only thing we know is that [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4011.7999999999997s)]
*  you ought to be consistent, otherwise you're not rational. That's as a normative principle, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4019.4s)]
*  that consistency is the only normative principle. That strikes me as pretty odd. There are other [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4026.44s)]
*  things that seem to matter. There is human nature and human nature is not consistent. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4033.0s)]
*  I mean, we are context dependent, so our emotions are context dependent. We ought to have normative [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4038.84s)]
*  theories that are adapted to who we are as people, as humans. The idea of consistency is [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4046.68s)]
*  completely unfeasible for a finite mind and we have finite minds. So on that ground alone, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4057.48s)]
*  it would be questionable as the principle for a normative model. But one would want a normative [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4065.0s)]
*  theory that takes into account human nature and which the principle of consistency doesn't. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4072.6s)]
*  Next question over here. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4079.88s)]
*  So you talked a little bit about cultural differences. I was just wondering, do you think [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4081.64s)]
*  that there are some cultural aspects that are costly and some that are really good? And do [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4087.72s)]
*  you think that something like increased migration or open borders would dissolve these cultural [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4093.64s)]
*  differences and push toward a more optimal equilibrium? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4099.88s)]
*  Way beyond what I can talk about responsibly. That migration automatically causes [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4105.32s)]
*  cultural amalgamation. That's questionable. I have no idea how to answer your question. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4115.24s)]
*  Next question. Over here. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4122.92s)]
*  On this side. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4126.6s)]
*  We've run out. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRLDAT05KoE&t=4127.72s)]
