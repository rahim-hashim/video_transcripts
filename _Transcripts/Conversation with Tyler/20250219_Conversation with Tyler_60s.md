# Gregory Clark can probably predict who you're going to marry | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA)
*  Thank you, Professor Clark. It was a lot of fun. What do you think are the practical implications [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=0.0s)]
*  of your work for finding a spouse in the modern world? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=4.08s)]
*  I'm not sure what to advise you. I can tell you that I met my wife when we were both graduate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=10.08s)]
*  students at Harvard. I was the first man she met at Harvard. So maybe she wasn't particularly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=17.36s)]
*  selective in terms of... I mean, what can you say? I mean, you see a general pattern. Do we know [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=25.6s)]
*  that that pattern makes people happy? Maybe everyone with highly assortative marriage is [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=33.84s)]
*  actually unhappy. And if instead they had chosen a spouse on grounds of romance or something else [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=38.56s)]
*  like that, they would be much better off. So I can't give you any advice on marriage. All I can [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=46.08s)]
*  do is say I can predict the kind of person that you're going to marry. Thank you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du8OpbdqmcA&t=54.08s)]
