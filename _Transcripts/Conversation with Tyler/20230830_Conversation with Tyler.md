# Vishy Anand on Staying in the Game  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [August 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XACy_6D4WLk)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler. Today I'm honored to be in Chennai
*  with Vishy Anand, five-time world chess champion and one of the greatest chess players of all
*  time. Vishy, welcome. Thank you, Tyler. Let's go back in time. 1991, you're playing in Reggio
*  Emilia, arguably the strongest tournament of all time when it happened. Karpov is there,
*  even Polagevsky shows up, right? And you win. What was the change in you that enabled you to be in
*  a position to win that tournament? I think it's just the work I've been doing had kind of accumulated
*  and I'd hit a certain level. So to give you some background, I qualified for the candidates for the
*  first time in the Interzonal in Manila in 1990, about July 1990. And Reggio Emilia was a year and
*  a half later. So for the first time, I started to work seriously on my openings. I got together some
*  trainers. This training will look very funny to modernize, but back then it was considered,
*  let's say... What is it they would do to you? Well, we would actually sit on the board and move the
*  pieces ourselves. And for the first time, they systematically went down a list and said, if you're
*  going to play this opening, all these things have to be checked. And I had not thought like that
*  before. My thing was I'll check the top two things and I'll figure out the rest. Which was not as
*  silly as it sounds today because back in the day, that's how you played chess. The computers couldn't
*  play chess at all at that stage. So for the first time, I thought in an organized way, I started to
*  work. And there are people opposite you who contradict you, who are strong enough to contradict
*  you and tell you, no, actually, I think you're wrong here. You should think of this move or this
*  is better, that is better. Or I once did this and what have you. So you start to work like that on a
*  systematic basis. I played my first candidates match in January in Chennai against Dreyf. And
*  suddenly I was paired against Karpov for the quarterfinals. That was going to be in Brussels
*  in July, so roughly a year since I qualified. Again, I worked with Gurevich, who had been on
*  Kasparov's team and so on. I started working with him a lot. I had played Linares, I had played Munich,
*  so I suddenly started to play very strong tournaments and face his opposition regularly.
*  Gurevich taught me lots of things. First of all, a lot of personal insights about Karpov. You know,
*  he always used to say when Karpov was fidgeting with his lips like this, that means he's not quite,
*  he's calculating but he's not quite sure what's happening and he's nervous. And then you look for
*  it and you actually see the man fidgeting with his lips and then you realize that his moves are
*  shaky. You know, it kind of opens your eyes to the practical element. We went on, we worked very hard.
*  Again, I think the level with him was one notch higher than what I'd worked with Van de Veel and
*  Hellers. So I worked with Gurevich in a very, one funny story. The first day I asked Gurevich if I
*  could watch, there was a Star Trek going on in the background, would he mind if I watched that
*  while we work? And he said no. He said if you want to watch Star Trek, I'll go to my house. You call
*  me when it's over, I'll come back but we're not doing two things at the same time. This is classic Star Trek.
*  Yes, we're talking 91. So I said okay, okay, then forget it. I'll switch it off and I was kind of annoyed.
*  I didn't see why I couldn't have that running in the background, which just shows the gulf in
*  professionalism if you like. But it was like that. His thing was very, very systematic. During the match
*  with Karpov, we would adjourn games that again, was still happening then. We'd adjourn games,
*  which means that you seal your 40th or your 60th move. You continue another day. And Gurevich would
*  sit and analyze for me. We would discuss the position briefly. Then he'd tell me, no, you go to sleep.
*  I'm going to spend the whole night working. So he would work till three or four in the morning,
*  checking everything alone. And the next morning when I woke up, he would brief me on everything.
*  So and then you suddenly realize, oh my god, how many things he found while he was working
*  on this position. Mine was very scatterbrained because I was an intuitive player. I often couldn't
*  explain what it is I was going to do. I would find the correct move very often. But if you pin me as
*  to why, I didn't really know. It was just the way I played chess. So this kind of thing. I played a
*  couple of tournaments between Brussels and Reggio Emilia. Specifically, I played in Tilburg. I beat
*  Kasparov. I beat Karpov. I beat Kamski. I beat Kocznoj. I beat Schott. But I also lost to Kasparov.
*  I lost to Kamski. I lost to Karpov. And some of these losses were just ridiculous. Because you were
*  playing too intuitively? Because I was volatile. Some positions I would get excited, think that
*  things are going very well. I'd start playing fast, miss a few things, then come back. I stepped
*  over the mark. This, that. All the things. What I think made the difference was I was suddenly
*  facing people who didn't resign the game very quickly, who didn't collapse. Especially Karpov.
*  Even in the worst positions, he would continue resisting. And that's an art you learn. And then
*  you realize this point is not going to come easily. I've got to push again and push harder and push harder.
*  And it's one thing training for this, but it's not real. The second thing is actually facing it over
*  the board. And then it becomes real in a way. And all these things combined. And then in Reggio Emilia,
*  I won my first game with Salov. I suddenly thought, I actually played that game quite well. I don't know
*  what happened, but I played that game quite well. Then I beat Kasparov in the second round. Again,
*  it seemed pretty easy. And I'd already beaten him twice within two months. Then I lost to Gurevich,
*  my trainer. Your trainer, yes. My trainer. And he seemed to know, he lured me into a totally harmless
*  position and then waited for me to get impatient. And I mean, literally someone who has good
*  psychological insight into you. That was annoying. Then I got incredibly lucky against Polugaevsky.
*  And then a couple of draws against Gelfand and Ivanchuk, amongst others. And in the last round,
*  I beat Beliavsky, still in a natural way. I mean, it's not like I had gone that far from my roots,
*  but it happened. And Kasparov drew with Harlefman. Karpov drew with Gelfand. And I realized,
*  I'm on first place. So that was a very, very nice surprise. I remember faxing a friend. Just,
*  I won, I won, I won. I wrote it three times and faxed it to him. I don't know if everyone in the
*  audience will know what a fax machine is, but anyway. We are some of us, remember? Yeah. So I
*  did that and I was very excited and so on. And I felt stronger. I realized that the same people
*  who caused me a lot of problems earlier in the year, I was at least able to deal with them. It's
*  a work in progress because they also constantly work at self-improvement and so on. But at least,
*  I felt I could confront them on equal terms. If you were playing Ivanchuk back then, when he
*  was at his peak, younger, how would you approach that psychologically? Because he's a very dangerous
*  opponent, right? If he's in the right mood, he can whip Magnus at five-minute chess. He is very
*  dangerous, but there are some patterns. I found that actually we met in the world cadet, so the
*  under-16 championships in 1984. And then we kind of kept bumping into each other. And actually,
*  my initial score with him was quite positive. I think I've never had a negative score against him.
*  But quite often in painful moments, moments when I wasn't expecting any danger from him, that's when
*  he would beat me. So there's a clear pattern. I wouldn't call it underestimation, but you kind
*  of feel you're wallowing in your strength and you think it'll probably work out fine. There's no need
*  to worry about all these things. And then that's when he would beat you. And when you're fully
*  concentrated, well, his score is not so good. So the solution kind of suggested itself. But he was
*  a tricky opponent all my life. The thing is because I started out with an early plus score
*  against him, and he saw it as a stiff rivalry. Initially, I just thought, well, he's Soviet,
*  so he must be better than me. So I didn't feel any rivalry. Then even when I got better than him,
*  I didn't switch into this that he's my rival. I kept thinking, well, we're all rivals, but we're
*  all facing how to get to the World Championship. But he felt his rivalry much more. And then the
*  next year, Luis Renter, the organizer of Linares, he organized a friendly match between Ivanchuk and
*  me. And I beat him there. Slightly undeserved. I mean, in a sense, I didn't get good positions,
*  but I won them anyway. But that's chess. And I think it bugged him a lot. And so for many years,
*  he would ignore the rest of the tournament. He almost couldn't concentrate against the others.
*  Then when he came against me, you knew he'd been waiting the whole week for this one game. And it
*  was kind of annoying to have such a mark on your back. There's one guy who is just looking for,
*  thinking of you all the time while you're thinking of all your opponents in a very organized fashion.
*  Anyway, many, many years later in Tata Steel in 2003, in Viscons. I realized that he wasn't even
*  concerned about me anymore. Now the new mark for him was Ponomariov, who had just beaten him. So I
*  felt relieved. Okay, you can have Chucky. But Ivanchuk's level can vary enormously. And I think
*  that was the tricky part in playing him. You had to focus a bit harder than others. You couldn't
*  get by in just natural moves. Because he could be playing genius moves or his level could drop a
*  lot. And he's even more vulnerable, I think, psychologically than many others. So if he's not
*  in the right frame of mind, his level can plummet. But equally, he can suddenly motivate himself to
*  do great things. And the hardest problem even is that he looks totally distracted during the game.
*  And that also lulls you into a false sense of security. So with him, it's always psychology,
*  watching his face, things like that which mattered more than the actual moves.
*  1995, to fast forward, you beat Kasparov at the Intel Grand Prix. Legend has it you spent only
*  10 minutes on your moves. And this was a slow classical game. How did you manage that? Why only
*  10 minutes? It was actually a rapid game. It was a rapid game. So we played it
*  in Moscow. And I kind of found myself playing against him. It was a morning session. We had
*  an evening session. So both matches were on the same day. And I just wanted to play something
*  relatively harmless. So I played some solid setup. I thought today is not the day for the
*  theoretical battle. I just play something sensible. Yeah, Queen d4 against the Sicilian. Queen d4 came back.
*  And I'll just do something sensible. And we'll worry about this another day, theoretical battle
*  another day. And one of the things about Gary, it doesn't come up very often. Obviously, his results
*  are very, very favorable to him. But over a long enough career, you notice it often enough. You give
*  him a position where he is not very active and he thinks he has to lash out. And this has nothing to
*  do with this understanding of chess. It's simply he has this urge to lash out and be tactical. And
*  for instance, Kramnik is lethal with him. Because he knew how to get the kind of positions where
*  Gary would lash out and then he would punish it. My style didn't allow me to punish him quite so
*  well. So I've exploited it on fewer occasions. But that one went like a dream in Moscow. And later,
*  and it made up for losing to him a little bit earlier in the month in Riga. So I was happy to
*  win that against him. Then when I went and lost to Ivanchik in the final, who did his typical
*  thing of suddenly realizing his whole life depended on this one game. So I lost to him and
*  then played the match against Gary a few months later. Speaking of Kramnik, in your match against
*  Kramnik, you played 1-D4 a number of times, which was surprising. Why didn't he respond with the more
*  hyper theoretical line, like try the Grunfeld, say, and try to catch you unprepared? Because usually
*  you've played E4 in your career, at least up till then. That's right. What had changed in the
*  meantime, one is computers, which meant that even a player who didn't have a lot of experience in an
*  opening might simply have good computer moves. And if you have good computer moves, you understand
*  them well and you play them where they're supposed to be played. Then understanding cannot make up
*  for it. The computer evaluation, the gap is just too strong. So imagine that the computer says this
*  move and you're plus one. I'll take that against anyone. I'll take that even against a specialist,
*  because those are pretty good odds. In fact, it is one of the things which has leveled preparation,
*  that a club player who knows one opening well can play against a top grandmaster in that opening.
*  And so the top grandmaster's insight has to be take a look at the club player, sort of gauge what
*  he might have done, have a sense of what areas he specializes in, then avoid them at all costs,
*  because that's the best strategy for success. You avoid the club player's preparation. It doesn't
*  matter if you're playing it well or bad. The difference in level will show. But if you play
*  into anything where the computer could have had a guiding hand, you have pretty bad. Anyway,
*  the thing with Kramnik was that I had a team. All of them were default specialists. We had eight
*  months during which I could have trained a lot. And we trained a lot on default. We found interesting
*  ideas. I played training games, again to make up for this lack of understanding. Played training
*  games, check it again with the computer, go deeper and deeper, try to understand hidden nuances and
*  so on. So I was pretty confident that we had lines prepared against the Grunfeld Kings. In fact,
*  I had a complete default repertoire, start to finish. Even the most obscure lines, the job for
*  my second was, give me a line that doesn't lose and I don't look embarrassing. I can make a few
*  moves, come back, and then we can go drill deeper if he does something unexpected. So it wouldn't
*  have been that easy. But if he had the confidence, it wasn't a bad strategy to try. He could have
*  done it not because he thinks he's going to outplay me, but because he thinks, well, I know this just
*  as well as you. And let's see what you got. It's that kind of thing. So it's not quite as easy. In
*  fact, I face this often myself in reverse, that Kramnik used to play E4 suddenly a lot against me.
*  And it's very nice to say I have more experience than him, but where should I strike? Which is the
*  area he's likely to be weakened. That's not easy to pick out. Two of your wins with black in that
*  match are from the semi-sloth. He let you get very tactical positions. Why would he make that kind of
*  mistake? That is very strange. I would have to say he took it personally. He took this opening
*  personally. He just said, but this opening, my understanding of chess, everything I believe in
*  chess, on the chessboard, tells me I'm better here. And so he kept going back to it. First time it can
*  happen. I mean, he plays the main line. He thinks he's well prepared. And then I have this slightly
*  unusual line that I've prepared at depth. It goes bad. But game five, I think he took it personally.
*  By game eight, I had moved on because I knew that allowing for everything, we knew that his sense
*  that white was better was correct. And we had run as far with this as we should. And we went to our
*  second opening, which is the Vienna. And we went with that. But it's really only game five. He took
*  it personally. He came in. But once again, we had outstanding prep. And by a miracle,
*  my Polish trainer, Wojciech, he literally, we have this hurried conference from two to 225 or
*  something, where they just brush me up on everything and last minute stuff and everything.
*  So at about 220, Radek said, look, there's one thing I want to show you. Sit down. So I sat down.
*  And he showed me this one line exactly which happened in game five. And he said, this is a
*  terrible line. I've been spending, I've spent all night on it. I finally found an emergency solution.
*  It's an emergency parachute. You play a rook c5 at this point. The rook is kind of active on this
*  rank. And I've checked it. It doesn't lose on the spot. Go. So his job was, there's no way we can
*  cover everything in chess. I'm giving you sort of this position for dummies. This is all you need
*  to know. And you'll have to figure out the rest on your own. So I said, OK. So when I sat at the
*  board and I had this chance to play rook c5, I thought, thank God he briefed me on this at this
*  point. So there's some luck as well. And I knew every move I made, I said, rook c5, I don't trust
*  this position well. But Radek told me it works. That's good enough. And so on. So we went with that.
*  And then he blundered. But I was already in a very good situation. I knew what I had to do. I knew
*  I was where I was supposed to be. And I knew that I wasn't worse, which is enough to take to the board.
*  Your match against Apollav, you had help from Kramnik, Gasparov, Karlsson. How did they each
*  help you differently? And how does that reflect something about them as chess players?
*  So Karlsson, he had already been my sparring partner before the match with Kramnik. And we
*  repeated that. So literally, he came over. We played three days of blitz, five-minute chess.
*  And the idea was I would select all the positions that I was going to use and play it against him.
*  And we would not tell Karlsson what we were going to play. We were using Karlsson's strength as a
*  practical player and saying, if I surprise you with this, let me see how you react. Maybe you've
*  faced this before. Let me see how you react. And try to play against that, because I thought Karlsson
*  is of the level of Kramnik and Apollav. So playing against him gives me a good sense of how they'll
*  play, how the games will materialize, and so on. He did that in both times. He didn't help much
*  during the match. I think once in a while, Nielsen was obviously in touch with him. So they would chat
*  on Skype or whatever. And he might give an impression, but it wasn't more than that.
*  Kasparov would call in a couple of times. He gave me some of his notes in specific openings. He said,
*  look, they're outdated, but for what it's worth, here they are. And you can check them with modern
*  analysis. That's fine. Kramnik was the heaviest, which is literally...
*  We had come to the conclusion that Kramnik's approach against Apollav hadn't been a bad
*  approach. So we were copying the Catalan, what we call the Alistar variation of the Slav defense.
*  And we were copying many aspects of how he plays that play. Because he doesn't like to be passive,
*  right? Is that how you think about it? Topalov. Topalov doesn't like to be passive, but he's also
*  much more of a... He actually can play positional chess incredibly well, but over the board, he
*  tends to lapse in this area. And the gap between him, between his positional play and his
*  sharp openings that he's really comfortable with is huge. So stylistically, he's more limited.
*  And the idea was, you are a better natural player than me. So you should try to steer the game
*  through to Slavs more harmless, which is how we came out of the Kramnik approach.
*  More harmless waters, play sensible chess, and don't get into forced lines that much. And you'll
*  probably have the easier time of it. I mean, more of a philosophical thing. So Kramnik called
*  Kazimshanov after the fourth game. And he said, I'm flattered that you are trying to copy my
*  openings, but you're doing it very badly. Can I help? I mean, literally, that's what he said,
*  which is the funniest story. So we said, of course you can help. And I was amazed how dedicated he
*  was. He was just doing this on his own thing. So he could have easily said, I'll help you for
*  an hour. I would accept it. I'll look at your notes for 10 minutes. I would accept it. But
*  there were days he sat with the team till five in the morning, working all night.
*  He had just gone to Baku to play an event. He played there. And then at night he would work with us.
*  And for the team, it was great because we were getting his insights into the opening. We realized
*  so much we had missed. He started to think. And every game, he basically became my fifth second
*  from game five till the final game. And I couldn't possibly thank him enough.
*  So that was... And I'd just beaten him two years ago in the match. So again, it was,
*  I think his ability to put that aside that impressed me. We had kind of spoken a little
*  bit the previous year about his newborn daughter and kind of broke the ice. But I was still feeling
*  awkward. I thought it might take a bit of time for both of us to move on. But in fact, he
*  seemed to be able to take this very well. And so they all
*  helped me in different ways. And it was nice. When you get that kind of feedback,
*  it of course gives you a lot of confidence. In your 2013 game against Aronian at Tata,
*  when you played 15 for black, Bishop c5, all the ensuing combinations and tactics, how much of that
*  were you seeing in advance? So that's literally this position, right? And I played Bishop c5. So
*  I'll tell you, I spent 25 minutes in this position because I couldn't remember a thing.
*  I vaguely remembered that... Sorry, I'll move the pieces. Yeah. That if he goes h3, then this is
*  the draw. Right. And that's what he should do, right? And that's a draw. And Bishop e4 then?
*  That is some draw. I think you take and Bishop b8 and then the knight is loose. And the details are
*  a thing. But when he played f4, I thought this move, I don't remember at all. And I was
*  searching, racking my brain to find out why. And I could not figure it out. Then suddenly,
*  I had this almost... Something flashed in my head. And this knight was on this square, on d3.
*  In your head? In my head. I suddenly... Some variation flashed where I had a knight on d3.
*  I couldn't for the life of me connect it. But I started to look if there's something... There are
*  obvious moves anyway. I can do this trying to get to d3. I can play e5, all based on the same ideas
*  in the game. But none of them seem to work. This one is too slow. He takes and these things. This
*  one... I mean, he'll allow me to take and recapture it. So what's the deal? Eventually, by elimination,
*  I realized it must be Bishop c5. There's nothing else. But once I started to look at Bishop c5,
*  it started to look good to me. And then it closes very fast. It's like finding out 80% of the map.
*  Then the rest fills in very fast. It gets accelerated. And you knew knight d5 was coming
*  at that point. That was the thing. So I'll tell you, I played Bishop c5 because if he takes, I take,
*  he captures here. Then my dream, my vision, whatever, is check and knight captures d3. And then
*  that knight which pops into d3 works. So that's all I had to reconstruct. But it is beautiful that
*  with very little, I was able to reconstruct it. Now I went here. Aronian was a bit shocked
*  because he had not given it a lot of attention. But it was very courageous on him, his part,
*  to even get here because I had prepared this for a match against Gelfand. And the guy lets me...
*  And basically says, show me what you got. Show me what you and your team spent a month on.
*  It's brave, but it's also kind of irresponsible. I mean, unless you've checked it yourself very
*  thoroughly. So he seems to have been slightly flippant about it. Anyway, after Bishop e2, the
*  rest played itself. For me, Bishop c5 took 25 minutes. I don't remember knight d5 might have
*  taken me five minutes, but more because I was double checking rather than anything. But this
*  came effortlessly because already we are talking of this knight has to support this one.
*  The queen and bishop are going to flood into d4. Knight f2 check is going to win. All these little
*  dots. So while this is maybe the most spectacular move, it's the less difficult move to find,
*  especially once you have done this. So now if you ask me, before I saw Bishop c5, did I see knight
*  d5? I did not even see Bishop e2. I was more focused on the main thing. I didn't see Bishop e2.
*  So once he played Bishop e2, everything else filled itself and I flooded in. And of course,
*  the big advantage was by now, Rottelevi-Robinstein was coming into my head. So I knew what happens,
*  well, we'll get the structure a bit later, but I knew what happens when you get this bishop,
*  this bishop, all pointing in this direction. Smothered mate, h3 becomes impossible.
*  Roughly speaking, this was Rottelevi-Robinstein with a knight here.
*  It's a classic game in chess history. So I knew the patterns and all the details check out. So
*  once I played knight d5, the rest came pretty fast. There was only one more thing I had to find. King
*  h1, knight takes g4. Again, every move loses except what he did. And then f5 is a brilliant move.
*  f5 is fantastic because for a dangerously long time, and later on you shiver when you
*  shudder when you realize what you could have done, for quite some time I considered this move.
*  Yeah, but then queen h7 and it's a draw, right? Or maybe you're even worse?
*  Maybe even I'm worse. But the beauty is, this move was slightly easier to find because seven
*  years ago, Kramnik had allowed queen h7 against Fritz, mate. And Kramnik and pretty much everyone
*  said, there is no way I would have allowed queen h7 if the knight had been on f6. Because to a
*  human, immediately it signals danger all over the place. But a knight on f8, you almost forget it's
*  there. Whereas for a computer, it sees that both moves allow queen h7. So at some point I realized,
*  oh my God, queen h7, well, that would spoil a very nice position. Then by elimination again,
*  I could play f5. And once again, all the dots come together.
*  And the queen will come to h4 in one way or another, it will be over. And then you just knew
*  you're completely winning. And there's one more detail if you like, which is that here,
*  I have to play this. Yeah. But it wins. It's the only move which doesn't lose, but it also wins.
*  When Magnus did the Lex Reedman podcast, he drew a distinction between chess players
*  who see only short lines but are great at evaluation. He called himself one of those.
*  Or Karawana, who calculates very long lines but is not as good at evaluation. Does that
*  dichotomy make sense to you? Very much. It's just the way your brain processes thoughts.
*  So some people fill in the gaps intuitively. When the pieces feel right, when the broad
*  picture looks right, the answers will come to you. And you're guided more by the sense of
*  what is good and not. Of course, Karawana does it as well, but to a lower degree. So he calculates
*  a lot more to fill in the gaps. And therefore, Karawana is a lot better at finding exceptions.
*  The natural players miss exceptions because what looks good to them, well, they happen to
*  stumble on the one position where what looks good isn't good. And it hurts them. Karawana tends to
*  miss that less often because he's not... In fact, Karawana's approach, you could almost exaggerate
*  and say it's closer to a computer than many other humans. Of course, he's 1% of the way closer,
*  but it doesn't matter. And there are players who approach chess in a more systematic way.
*  And they're the ones who tend to find exceptional ideas and things like that
*  because of the way they don't rule out stuff just on dogmatic grounds or something like that.
*  But we are talking very small differences. I think Karawana's understanding is
*  much closer to, let's say, Carlson's thing. But yes, his approach is to calculate everything and
*  look for very specific solutions. Carlson's, as he says, hand will make the move. You just know
*  where the pieces go and then you don't need the details. And how do you prepare differently
*  against each type of player? I don't get down to that level of detail. If I was playing a match,
*  I could try to incorporate that in my approach. But so much of chess is just
*  getting the opening right, the moves right, the concepts right, that you don't have time
*  to micro target like that. It just doesn't work. And you're more... At least not for me.
*  Perhaps others are able to do it. I would think the maximum level you could do it at is to
*  choose the kind of opening which favors you the most intuitively and say, from what I know of
*  my opponent, this is the position where he's fidgeting uncomfortably in his chair. And once
*  you've chosen the opening, you hope that, well, that insight actually plays out. But at least for
*  me, I've never been able to target much more. Like I just said, when I was playing Topalov,
*  I used my insight into being to say, well, these openings will work for me and he'll get impatient.
*  He'll try to do something active. Maybe I can punish him. But once I've done that, the rest are
*  just long lines and I can't use that insight anymore within the games. You'll have flashes
*  of this at most, but chess is actually mostly long variations. What goes on inside your head
*  during a match that no normal human could guess at? Surprisingly how distracted we are. During a match,
*  even in very critical moments, I'll be thinking, oh, I can have a dinner,
*  what I should have done yesterday, that I met that jerk yesterday, and this kind of stuff.
*  Your brain wanders off and it's almost like taking your foot off the gas. Your brain wants to
*  wander off for a while. You let it and then you come back. You keep one part focused on what's
*  happening, but while your opponent is thinking, you can wander off. I think whenever somebody tells me,
*  I don't know how you concentrate for seven hours, I understand that they don't know how we play chess
*  or that they haven't played chess themselves because we do not concentrate for seven hours.
*  Very few people do it and I would think even the brain simply says it goes on strike periodically
*  and then comes back. I think that's how it works. You've argued in your career you had a down period,
*  something like 2011 to 2013. Until recently, Kairawanna seemed to have a down period for a
*  while. Why does that happen to very top players? It's very hard to explain. If you could even see
*  it coming, you could start to think about it, but my feeling is it catches most people off guard.
*  They repeat a recipe, probably too long, and it's not like anybody else spotted it coming.
*  Suddenly you notice, hey, he's not winning. After one or two tournaments, you think,
*  he's not winning quite as much as he used to, didn't he? Then you take a look
*  and you realize that slowly some resistance has built up in his games, resistance to
*  the free flow, the most natural flow. It's very hard to see it coming and then when you're stuck
*  in it, it's very hard to see how to get out of it. In most cases, at least in my experience,
*  the way to get out of it is to stop thinking about how to solve it and almost lighten yourself and
*  get back to playing a normal game for normal reasons. You'd think that method could be
*  refined and you could apply it systematically, but if it did, nobody would have slumps anymore in
*  form. There is something clearly that we can't quite pick up on. It's a kind of staleness that
*  gets into your game. It's probably an accumulation that if you're doing too well for too long,
*  others have been working nonstop trying to understand you and at some point without you
*  or them realizing it, the gap is closed and then you're encountering more resistance. You're doing
*  what worked perfectly before, but you're encountering more resistance. You can't see why and your
*  opponents don't understand why they're not losing, but they suddenly think, hey, this worked out better
*  for me and somehow the gap closes and the time has come for you to move on, try something else,
*  bring some fresh perspective. What's your favorite Monty Python skit?
*  I like the one with the pope. There's several with the pope. Well, that's true. That's true.
*  Well, basically Michelangelo. Yeah, that's a good one. I like Argument Clinic very much.
*  Yes, and there's a lot of nice stuff with the Ministry of Silly Walks.
*  Parrot is very good. Yes, Cheese Shop is very good. Yes, Dead Parrot is very good. Summer Rise
*  Proust, do you know that one? They didn't show that one that much. Yeah, no, that I missed, but
*  those were nice and also the Yorkshiremen, these guys all talking about how poor they were in their
*  childhood. That's fantastic. I love the idea of a cardboard box in the highway.
*  Was Fawlty Towers ever as good as Monty Python? I'll tell you the first time I was staying with,
*  I visited the Indian Consul General in The Hague and he invited me to stay for lunch because
*  he's also from Chennai, so he invited me to stay for lunch and so I said, well, that's very nice.
*  Thank you. I'll stay. Either before we were about to have lunch or after we had had lunch,
*  he said, okay, I'll put some, he put a cassette in and it was Fawlty Towers.
*  And I started watching. At first, I didn't understand the humor at all.
*  I wasn't even that familiar with Monty Python then, so it gives you an idea,
*  but the humor seems strange and then there's always this one situation which is so absurd
*  that you just can't stop laughing and at some point I was laughing but like a person who could
*  not stop and I was choking almost and that's when I knew. So I would have to say Fawlty Towers as
*  good. There are lines which are fantastic that are simply. Don't mention the war, right?
*  Don't mention the war. Maybe I've just watched it way too much, but this hotel inspector is great.
*  The health inspector is good and what I love is this blind, well, this deaf old lady who comes by
*  and complains about everything and he says, what were you expecting from a hotel window docus?
*  And also the lovely thing, yes, madam, that's the sea. It's between the land and the sky.
*  It's perfect stuff. What's the most underrated Queen song?
*  I don't know. I rate all of them very highly. Bright and rock, I might pick. I've heard Bohemian
*  Rhapsody too many times at this point. Yes, I've heard Bohemian Rhapsody as well and my problem is
*  my son recently discovered Queen so we listen to it again almost in overdrive. I don't think
*  I have an underrated Queen song. I'm aware that out there there might be songs that are underrated.
*  They're all underrated and you're here, right? Yeah, but for me I rate them perfectly highly.
*  Yeah. But I have this habit of listening to my four or five favorite songs in an album and kind
*  of ignoring the ones I don't like so my son is more disciplined in that way. He'll actually listen
*  to the whole album. So he asks me questions about songs. Some I'll be. I'll give him two
*  odd descriptions. Other ones I'll say, you know, I've never heard that one. In chess, opening
*  preparation, where does that end? What's the bottleneck? Does it just keep on going until
*  the first 33 moves are prepackaged? Some lines will go that far but equally you can use the
*  computer to solve the problem that the computer has created which is that if you take a single
*  line and you go, I think you can go very very far but you can also deviate at an earlier and earlier
*  stage and you can always, you can have it running on 20 lines and you go for line number 17 and you
*  think and you'll find that you're not able to work it out just as thoroughly. You need time to do it
*  and before you do that you move to the next one. So no one's quite able to nail every possibility.
*  You can always surprise someone. We saw this with Ding recently in a publishing. He actually went
*  H3 in one position. Yeah. But it was a surprise. Surprise backfired because Yan seemed to know
*  exactly which line to play and he went for the one line where H3 turns out to be a disadvantage.
*  That's very hard to nail down. You have to get quite deep into it. Mostly that works and but yes
*  even with that qualification the opening preparation everywhere is just building up and up and up.
*  There are lines I neglect for six months and then I come back to them and I realize my god I have to
*  update everything. I'm not sure of anything, any of this preparation anymore. The problem in preparation
*  is not whether it's detailed. The problem is whether you can believe in it and if you have not
*  checked it 100 percent it's worthless. I mean it's like a 99 percent guarantee before you go to the
*  operation. You want to have a 100 percent guarantee right. So it's 99 percent is simply not good enough
*  and that's the problem with opening preparation as well that the computer allows you to question
*  everything. Every new version, every new program, every new piece of hardware, each one of those
*  things can drive it. So every six months or a year you have to start all over again cleaning
*  your stuff. On the other hand it's one of the great joys in chess research is to come to an opening
*  that you've not seen in five years and that first day you're discovering everything new.
*  Every single line you refute and clean up and you feel like you've
*  cleaned your entire house of clutter and you feel wonderful. So that's
*  it. It's a double-edged sword. I will concede that but it's a pain in the neck when you want to rely
*  on something. That people are playing the guillacopiano again. Is it that we've discovered
*  it's better than Ruy Lopez or just we're sick of all the old lines and we're going to try something
*  different for three years and then move on and the two nights game is even coming a bit into fashion
*  and is it cycling or continuous improvement? It's a lot of it cycling. At some point I don't
*  remember maybe five or six years ago there was a kind of individualistic collective sense that
*  maybe the Ruy Lopez is neglected territory, virgin territory. Let's go back there and try
*  there because of Italian and the guillacopiano. My god there's nothing left to find and then we
*  do everybody goes after the Ruy Lopez for a year and suddenly a couple of guys say let's look at
*  the Italian again and you think ah there are a few things we haven't picked up on so you swing back
*  there and it goes like this but it's an arms race and we're not winning. Was it a kind of market
*  inefficiency that the King's Indian defense could survive for so long? I mean Rajabhav did pretty
*  well with it until recently. You've played it a fair amount but it just seems like a bad move right?
*  There's a time when it looked just lost. Yeah. No I mean there was a time maybe
*  five six years ago when the King's Indian just looked lost because the computer always said it
*  was lost and recently maybe even a year ago the computer said no I confirm it's dead lost
*  but people have always said that there's something fundamentally unsound about the King's Indian but
*  it we couldn't quite prove it and that was where people are going on. You know the famous quote
*  of Kocsnoi right? He said he told Aaron Pickett the King's Indian is not an opening it's a disease
*  and so he was basically he had it right all along
*  and so recently Fabiano started playing head six in the King's Indian the classical King's Indian
*  and the beauty of that is it's not quite refutable. It's got just enough life to drag on for a while
*  and people come to parts of the King's Indian that they like so the King's Indian that aligns you
*  that you find difficult to play but if you come in from a Grunfeld move order and White does
*  something against anti-Grunfeld and you swing from there back to the King's Indian or you come from
*  a Benoni move order and you get into the King's Indian or even you put the bishop on e7 and rotate
*  it this way that way King's Indian concepts turn out to be very very dynamic and healthy even if
*  you're not getting into it in the same structured opening. So King's Indian players have found a way
*  to get their you know the King's Indian fix for the week without having to go down the old main
*  line and that's how it goes but computers will contradict themselves every couple of years so
*  maybe the pendulum has swung to the father side. Does Fisher Random have a future
*  or it's just a side thing forever? Fisher Random actually has a brilliant future because it is a
*  it's a form of chess which has not been understood at all. However with this thing Fisher Random was
*  conceived as a way of avoiding opening theory later on people rediscovered it as a way of avoiding
*  computers now we realize we're not avoiding computers at all they're just as good at Fisher
*  Random or no castling as they are at chess. New versions we're never going to catch up with
*  computers but for playing amongst ourselves this is completely new territory and we can there's a
*  lot of scope for creativity and everything we used to look for. So it's the it's an opening with a lot
*  of it's a variant with a lot of promise maybe the one with chess players are most comfortable with
*  however in the meantime I have played no no castling a few times. Yes. That turns out to
*  be fascinating. The first time I sat with my computer and I had to play knight f3 rook g1
*  and repeated four corners all four rooks and knights so that white couldn't castle anymore
*  and then switch on the engine and analyze openings like this and I realized that
*  almost every opening can be reevaluated if you're king khan castle and so everywhere the right plan
*  turns out to be h4 h5 rook h4 thing except the ones where it's not and you don't there are no
*  general rules yet or we have not come that far so we find every little detail now there are lots of
*  other versions that are coming up and you can versions you can have as many as you dream of
*  so you can have pawns moving sideways pawns capturing straight and moving horizontal I mean
*  diagonally you can have every which variant you want you program it into the computer and let it
*  play a million games and see what comes pops out so this may be a solution for the distant future
*  but for the moment chess looks healthy enough especially if you vary people who have played
*  too much classical chess have a round of faster controls and then we have done too many faster
*  controls you go back to classical and if you keep varying that like this that's one thing that keeps
*  the game moving along the second thing that works very well is for instance what they do in
*  tata steel which is to have a mixed field not all super prepared top gms but a mixture of very young
*  courageous juniors with top gms you have that mix that also leads to a lot of unpredictability so
*  if you keep moving around you change the format change the very end change the time control change
*  this change that you just keep shuffling we can go on for quite some time is there a chance that
*  10 years from now say rapid play is the world chess championship I wouldn't rule it out I wouldn't rule
*  it out but I feel that classical would still exist it's just public taste would have moved along
*  and the same could be said for blitz chess if you want and we're also dealing now with thanks to
*  the revolution of the last five or six years which in general I mean
*  what happened with the queen's gambit what happened the last couple of years which is that
*  maybe the number of people who are casual fans of chess are far greater than some of the people
*  maybe the number of people who are casual fans of chess are far greater than serious fans of
*  chess sure of course and they are actually following the game now but before they would
*  follow it once in a while now they actually have an impact and you sense it in the numbers
*  and thanks to them I think they may not have this old attachment to classical chess
*  they may also not know who capo blanca was but
*  and when that is felt in the sport then the sport will inevitably cater to their tastes more and
*  more but I don't think that classical chess will disappear it's just that it used to be 100 percent
*  of chess then for the last couple of decades it's been about 80 percent of chess now I would say
*  it's closer to 30 40 percent of chess which leaves the other variants fighting with 60 percent the
*  other time controls fighting with 60 percent and it's a question of the mix there there will always
*  be some role for having a lot of time to think and find interesting stuff but I
*  all the time is very hard especially given modern preparation how is it you think that
*  playing so much as a streamer seems to have made knock him more better psychologically better too
*  right I don't think the streaming helps him become a better player but what it has done is it's taken
*  a lot of pressure off him he really felt he had only one way to show who he was and that was the
*  chess board and now he suddenly realizes I've got this other method where people appreciate me and
*  cheer me in fact many years ago in 2011 in Tata Steel he made a winner's speech and I was kind
*  of surprised the way he said he said it's so wonderful to be in Holland where we're appreciated
*  for our chess in the US nobody would care or something like that and he did this as the winner
*  in the closing speech and I thought well quite a strange thing to say but if you keep that thought
*  in the background now he's got the adulation he wants in fact he seems to crave it he goes back and
*  does a recap every day and things like that he really seems to want it
*  what I think is helping him is playing blitz tournaments non-stop online that allows him to
*  keep there and it might be the best way to train for a modern computerized opening preparation era
*  where there's so little to do with preparation because the computer solves everything but you
*  get to test every concept a million times over the board and that's why he's so good at it
*  and that's why all the best players now are playing these online blitz events you can put
*  me on the spot and say well if you think that's the case why aren't you doing it I haven't got
*  drowned I do some training online but I don't feel like sitting from midnight till three in the morning
*  I don't feel like playing online blitz these Tuesday events and so on but
*  if you were much younger could you imagine yourself as a streamer?
*  It pays well right? I can imagine being a streamer now very easily but what I
*  don't see myself doing is spending all night playing also I don't feel like playing that much blitz
*  I always tell myself I should do a bit more but in the end the body just doesn't get up and then
*  go there I easily see myself trying streaming or something but it's a question of how long you want
*  to invest in it I mean again success is not going to come very fast there'll you know there's a lot
*  of crocodiles already in that bank you'll have to in that watering hole you'll have to spend some
*  quite some time and do stuff daily and things like that and so it's a big time commitment is
*  what I'm trying to say and then so I could very easily see myself doing it
*  and I've done versions of it over the last couple years I did a lot of online coaching
*  lots of my talks that I used to give for companies I do online as well nowadays so I've done versions
*  of it I could see myself doing that especially commentary how difficult is it instead of going
*  to a tournament and doing commentary from there just to sit in your room and do it it's very easy
*  so that I could see the other bit probably I'm just a bit old I think it was MVL who made the
*  remark that in a post-alpha zero world what we've learned is how much chess is truly the concrete
*  and how few generalizations there are does that make sense to you or what do you think we've
*  learned from alpha zero that's that's a broader trend I don't even know if it starts with alpha
*  zero but maybe that's where it became the most visible but he's right there are no general
*  principles anymore if the computer says in fact new general principles emerge
*  nowadays we push the H and A pawns so whenever we want and it's not a bad move
*  but 20 years ago these moves would have been considered
*  betraying the complete lack of an interest education now it's not there so everything we
*  used to think was bad we're forced to evaluate move by move some of them will turn out to be bad many
*  of them won't and you just have to know specific reasons and you'll just have to get into the
*  details so he's he's right about that I think that's probably the cry from a person who's
*  having to prepare this stuff all the time but anyway he's he's right I think
*  just nowadays it's about finding out exceptions to everything and that's where a lot of the
*  growth is a chess player because all of us we are hardwired to think these things are good these
*  things are bad but imagine that you now have to wander in the field of everything you thought
*  was bad and realize that half of it might be good that's kind of where we see ourselves now
*  rick g1 against the night or is that a novelty move or actually a very good move
*  because no one played it in the time of fisher right no none at all but even when fisher played
*  h3 people thought what the hell is this and then they said oh but fisher did it it's okay
*  so you need a stamp of approval and the computer is now the new stamp of approval
*  rook g1 by the way predates alpha zero and it predates modern engines we're talking at
*  least 15 20 years bishop d2 on move six that is such nonsense even when the computer is running
*  i think but this is nonsense the fact that it doesn't lose on the spot tells me that
*  especially with a computer it doesn't lose on the spot tells me nothing but this is nonsense but
*  there are people who play it and then next thing you know this theory building up and
*  at age 53 you're still in the world top 10 there's no one else in the top 10
*  close to your age and you have been india's number one for what 37 years 38 years 37 years
*  oh what keeps you going what motivates you i i like playing chess couple of years ago i decided to
*  that maybe you know playing full-time playing the whole year round and trying to compete at
*  the highest level was wasn't worth it in terms of the amount of time and effort i would have to
*  put in for the results i expected so i decided to semi-retire a decision made easy in the pandemic
*  because everyone is semi-retired in the pandemic but the key thing was not to come back after the
*  pandemic was over so i played a little bit here and there whenever i could because i still like
*  playing and i like for me chess tournaments are primarily social events where you meet everyone
*  and you hang out with everyone again so when i did all that i enjoyed myself and then i'll say okay
*  now for four months i'm not going to play anything much longer break than before also i'm living in
*  india more or less the whole time when i'm not playing so that's a increase changed a lot
*  uh some of it is family you know my son is growing up so you also want to
*  prioritize what you're doing with your time and so on but
*  i really enjoy the few tournaments that i play so when i play these rapid and blitzes and i
*  have these one or two events in the year i try to four or five months months before leading up to
*  them i start training again just to get back in this frame of mind where it's chess is not just
*  some philosophical thing where you can do this and you can do that it's concrete moves like mbl said
*  and the most important skill in chess is if i was sitting at a board now with the clock ticking what
*  would i make in this position and then suddenly all the infinite variety of choices you have
*  becomes irrelevant you have to make only one move and how do you switch to that frame of mind
*  um i try to stick there but i i really love analyzing and working on chess and and maybe
*  even just like for hikaru having something else fill part of your life allows you to come back
*  to chess with much more enthusiasm these long breaks then when i get back to chess i'm much
*  more enthusiastic about playing and i look forward to it so that might be a huge fact as well do you
*  hate losing as much as caspar off does to me it seems he isn't even close to me but
*  i admit i can't see him from the inside and he probably can't see me from the inside
*  when i lose i can't imagine anyone in the world who loses as badly as i do inside so you think
*  you're the worst at losing at least that i know of and a couple of years ago i know people will
*  say but how are you such a good loser and i'd say i'm not a good loser i'm a good actor
*  i i know how to come stay composed in public i can even pretend for five minutes but i can only do
*  it for five minutes because i know that once the press conference is over once i can finish talking
*  to you i can go back to my room and hit my head against the wall because that's what i'm longing
*  to do now and in fact it's gotten even worse because as you get on you think i should have
*  known that i should have known that i should have known not to do that but then what is the
*  point of doing this a thousand times and not learning anything you get angry with yourself
*  much more so i hate losing much more even than before i think there's an interview with magnus
*  on youtube and they ask him to rate your sanity on a scale of one to ten i don't know if you've
*  seen this and he gives you a ten is he wrong uh no he's completely right um he's completely right
*  i think sanity is uh being able to show the world that you are sane even when you're insane
*  and therefore i'm i'm eleven overall how happy a lot do you think top chess players are say top 20
*  players i think they're very happy uh they they understand that they're able to be chess players
*  uh and that they can have a pretty good life doing so so just like anybody who finds that
*  they're doing what they wanted to do what they would be doing anyway even in under worse
*  circumstances but they're able to do it in a pretty nice way and challenging way uh then we
*  understand their privilege in fact the funny thing is how many chess players are happy even not being
*  top players uh because they just again one of these callings you you find yourself in it and
*  you really enjoyed it it's very quite hard for a chess player to quit and switch to something else
*  they always have this gap uh this time lag i was quite surprised to see when kenneth rogoff
*  became an economist as i did yeah yeah well he became an economist but recently maybe
*  seven eight years ago uh somebody asked him uh so um what's it like thinking about chess again
*  because he had come to a chess tournament so but i never stopped thinking about it and for me that
*  was strange because i would assume that after five years you it drops way below but apparently
*  he kept at it all that time he would think about chess every day when i see him he and i thought
*  maybe you had economics ah right well yeah he doesn't want to talk economics with me
*  sure if you had to boil down your your cognitive ability or abilities into as small a number of
*  dimensions as possible what's the cognitive ability you have that makes you special um
*  i think the ability well is it cognitive the ability to um pull out
*  details from a mass of information that i've seen so in chess we may see a thousand games from this
*  and then at the board i may be able to distill the right idea from all that
*  so being able to extract useful ideas from a lot of information also good visual
*  intelligence in just in in chess the only skill which a top chess player has to have really is
*  the sense that something is going wrong and that's a visual thing because with very few
*  details you suddenly think now i feel uncomfortable there's something wrong here that's one of the
*  most important skills you can have in chess um and besides probably just the usual mix
*  a bit of memory good memory at least for things that i'm interested in
*  ability to focus on one thing and then keep at it so and is there some other area where you have
*  also a remarkable ability um wow so magnus seems to be great at fantasy football some chess players
*  are great at bridge um i'm i'm sort of good in games and uh
*  lots of these games you play just for fun you immediately i find that i
*  start at an acceptable level so maybe there is some skill there but i have not
*  thought about it that much last two questions there's so many talented young chess players
*  from tamil nadu obviously you know them you play with them and if you're looking for who will
*  really climb to the top like praga gukesh other than just how well they play at the moment what
*  else do you look for um if they're very young i want to see a certain amount of fanaticism i
*  think fanaticism is good when you're in your teens um but quite a few of them have that um
*  um i think maturity is maybe the most important thing because pragananda and gukesh have taken
*  some horrible blows but what i've realized is that they're quite strong in a way that i'm amazed
*  maybe because i i for me losing hurts so much more i can no longer understand people who are
*  relaxed about losing uh and maybe i was once more relaxed i don't know but um praga and gukesh both
*  have taken some of the tough times recently quite well and come out of it now they're both
*  going gangbusters and that's great but they have had difficult times as well
*  and there are things i look for on the chess board just a sense that they understand a lot of stuff
*  without having to just like i mentioned earlier they know where the pieces go and
*  uh if i if i look at their games i can quickly get a sense of which area they focus in i mean some of
*  them uh have no understanding of chess at all but they have amazing sporting qualities which is that
*  they're tenacious they're able to keep resisting you can see that they don't have this dip of being
*  annoyed with themselves about the position and therefore their uh performance goes down if
*  anything they're still finding only moves they're still hanging in there um so some things like this
*  will alert me to some sporting qualities um but um the chess qualities i think i look for first
*  if not i wonder well they don't have this what could i want they possibly bring to the table
*  that compensates for it and then i realize ah they have these other sporting qualities
*  maybe even their fitness their ability to hang in there things like that last question where's the
*  best place to eat in chennai you should go to some of these uh utipi homes and we have some
*  places where they serve traditional south indian breakfast i think that uh and not in the bigger
*  places you have murugan idli i went to that was very good you know it that yeah murugan idli is
*  very good there's some nice utipi joints there's matzia you can try that um we go to the old dasa
*  chain as well there used to be something called dasa brahkash so um that's nice if you and then
*  you get how well for me it's almost a childhood thing literally that's how we used to snack when
*  and besides that some place which with a good thali gives you i think a good sampling of
*  everything in both south indian and indian cuisine vishyanand thank you very much thank you a pleasure
*  you
