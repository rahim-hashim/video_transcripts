# Russ Roberts on Vasily Grossman’s Life and Fate  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uu0JBDBOrE)
*  Today is November 4th, 2024, and my guest is economist, author, podcaster, and blogger
*  Tyler Cowen of George Mason University.
*  This is Tyler's 19th appearance on Econ Talk.
*  He was last here in November of 2023 discussing who is the greatest economist of all time.
*  Our topic for today is Vasili Grossman's masterpiece, Life and Fate.
*  We will minimize spoilers, but I'd encourage you to read the book before listening if that's
*  your habit.
*  As I've suggested, you may want to read this on the Kindle, which makes it a little easier
*  to follow the characters because it's easy to search for them if you forget who they
*  are.
*  This episode is also available on Tyler's podcast, Conversations with Tyler.
*  Tyler, welcome back to Econ Talk.
*  Thank you, Russ.
*  Is there a spoiler to tell them who won the war in the Battle of Stalingrad?
*  I was thinking of that.
*  I think we can reveal that.
*  Okay, that's fine.
*  Let's start then.
*  You have some introduction.
*  Well, I wanted to just say a little bit about Grossman and the book very briefly.
*  Vasili Grossman was born in 1905 in Bratitchev.
*  At the time, it was part of the Russian Empire.
*  Eventually, in 1922, after the revolution, became part of the Soviet Union.
*  He rose to some fame as a war correspondent.
*  He covered the Battle of Stalingrad.
*  People when they talk about this book, Life and Fate, say it's about the Battle of Stalingrad.
*  No, it's not.
*  It takes place around the time of the Battle of Stalingrad.
*  There is some war in the book, but that is, I think, a very misleading summary of what
*  the book's about.
*  He wrote the book after World War II.
*  The book was arrested by the KGB in 1961.
*  They came to his house.
*  They took the manuscript.
*  They took all the typewriter ribbons.
*  For those of you who are older than a certain age will know what that is.
*  They tried to find other copies.
*  They ended up digging up the garden of a friend of Grossman's, but did not find any other
*  copies.
*  It was successful in hiding a couple of copies with friends.
*  It eventually, the book was smuggled out in 1980 and published in Switzerland, published
*  in the Soviet Union in 1988.
*  Grossman died in 1964 unaware that his book had survived.
*  Just one other biographical note, which is relevant because of the nature of the book.
*  His mother was killed in 1941 when the Nazis overran Berdichev.
*  Berdichev was a town of about a little over 50,000 people.
*  About 40,000 were Jews.
*  It had 80 synagogues.
*  His mother died in the murders there.
*  His mother is an important part of this book in a fictionalized role, and we'll talk about
*  that.
*  Tyler, give us your short initial assessment of this book.
*  Amongst Soviet authors, he is the goat, one could say, to refer to our earlier episode.
*  But this to me is one of the very few truly universal novels.
*  So the title itself, Life and Fate, it is about life and fate.
*  But the novel is about so much more.
*  So it's about war.
*  It's about slavery.
*  It's about love, motherhood, fatherhood, childbirth, rape, friendship, science, politics.
*  How many novels, if any, can you think of that have all of those worlds in them in an
*  interesting and insightful manner?
*  Very few.
*  The one that comes closest to it is in fact his model.
*  That's Tolstoy's War and Peace, you know, a three-word title with an and in the middle
*  and two important concepts.
*  They're both about war.
*  They're both about the invasions of Russia or USSR.
*  There's a central family in both stories.
*  The notion of what is fate or destiny is highly important to Tolstoy as it is to Grossman,
*  though they have different points of view.
*  Napoleon plays a significant role in War and Peace.
*  In Life and Fate, Hitler and Stalin make actual appearances in the novel, which I find shocking
*  when I read it.
*  Like here they are on the page, and it's actually somewhat plausible.
*  So he's modeling this, I think, after War and Peace.
*  He actually pulls it off, which is a miracle.
*  I think it is a novel comparable in quality and scope and import to Tolstoy's War and
*  Peace, which is sometimes called the greatest novel ever.
*  So that is a pretty amazing achievement.
*  Yeah, I think I mentioned on the air in an earlier episode when I was reading it, you
*  know, I enjoyed the first hundred pages.
*  After 200, it got a little better, somewhere around 300 or 400.
*  I couldn't put it down.
*  There are so many passages that move you to tears or to incredible emotional reaction.
*  It's not a traditional novel, akin to War and Peace or akin to other Russian novels
*  such as The Brothers Karamazov or In the First Circle, which we talked about here on the
*  program previously.
*  It is what our guest talking about in the First Circle, Kevin McKenna, called polyphonic.
*  Here's how he described it.
*  He said Dostoevsky and Solstitizen are so similar.
*  Dostoevsky is famous for what is called the polyphonic structure of his novels.
*  That is, rather than having, as we are used to in the West, one central main character
*  who kind of stands as the centerpiece of everything that happens in the novel, the polyphonic
*  structure of a Dostoevsky or Solstitizen is that there is not a main central character.
*  There is a cast, I would say, perhaps five to eight central characters, as well as perhaps
*  three to four central major themes.
*  And so everything is kind of a fugue of characters, a fugue of plot.
*  In the case of Grossman and Life and Fate, I would say there are eight to ten main characters.
*  There's about a hundred characters overall, and that can be discouraging when you start
*  the book.
*  If you keep reading, you'll realize that only the eight to ten who are the main ones are
*  going to reappear over and over again, and often dozens or hundreds of pages apart when
*  they reappear.
*  But as you point out, Tyler, there are so many interesting intellectual and emotional
*  themes of the book.
*  It really spans an enormous part of the human experience.
*  In that sense, you could argue it's the greatest novel of the 20th century and for me, one
*  of the greatest novels of all time, certainly one of the greatest I've ever read.
*  I think another influence, and Grossman himself cites him repeatedly, is Chekhov.
*  So the chapters in Grossman often are mirroring Chekhov short stories, but they're woven together
*  in a way that Chekhov short stories are not.
*  With the notion of how is it you tell a narrative during a war that is so big and important
*  and tragic, I take to be one of his central endeavors.
*  And that too is something he mostly pulls off.
*  Yeah, the Chekhov part is there are just so many numerous vignettes, unforgettable vignettes
*  of characters struggling with betrayal, struggling with the state bearing down on them, whether
*  it's the Nazis or the communists.
*  One of the themes you didn't mention that reverberates throughout the book is the parallels
*  between the Nazis and the communists.
*  They're both in many ways fascist authoritarian states, but what he's really interested in
*  is how they grind the individual down and how the individual stands athwart that grinding,
*  and says, stop, no, I'm a human being.
*  I found that when I thought about the title, you'd think, well, why isn't it called Life
*  and Death or Freedom and Fate?
*  And for Grossman, life is really about freedom.
*  So in a certain sense, the title Life and Fate for me is very much one of the, not the
*  only but one of the central themes of the book, which is how human beings caught in
*  the throes and the gears of the state managed to maintain their freedom and their essential
*  humanity despite that brutal reality.
*  This is where I think we might disagree because I disagree with everything else I've read
*  about this book, including Grossman's, the main Grossman biography.
*  So if I had to name a central theme of the book, I think it's in a funny way, a patriotic
*  book arguing that communism for all of its horrible faults is actually better than fascism
*  and explaining or showing to us why it is better than fascism.
*  And I have a riff on that, which I'll do, but let me just put that out on the table
*  and hear your immediate reaction.
*  I'm not sure I disagree with that.
*  I wasn't suggesting that they were equivalent.
*  It's just that they have certain powerful equivalencies that the characters in the book
*  find repellent.
*  The idea that to the communists that they have a brother in the Nazis, the idea that
*  to the Nazis they have a brother in the communists is extremely disturbing.
*  And so Grossman forces a number of his characters to confront those similarities.
*  But I agree it's a very patriotic book.
*  It's a very Russian book.
*  There's a lot of talk in his biography and in people who write about him, how much he
*  was pro-regime, how much his antagonism to the regime and the Soviet regime changed
*  over how it grew over time.
*  And like his characters, and it's a very autobiographical book, which is bizarre, but it's a very autobiographical
*  book.
*  The main character, Victor Shrum, is a physicist, a world-class physicist.
*  And Grossman himself was a chemist, not a world-class chemist as far as I know, but
*  he identified with Shrum's marital problems, his problems of keeping faith with his conscience.
*  And in that sense, I think he's overwhelmingly certainly on the side of the Russians, but
*  I don't think he has any romance about communism.
*  I think what he sees as the fundamental difference is that for him, fascism is ultimately just
*  a philosophy of death.
*  So he says on page 94, man and fascism cannot coexist.
*  But the feature about communism, and he's under no illusions about its evils, as you
*  just said, is there's some degree of negotiability built into the system.
*  So if you look, say, when the Nazi commander, Lies, is interrogating Mastavskoy, Lies just
*  keeps on asking questions.
*  There's no dialogue.
*  Nothing can happen.
*  There's no real questions.
*  There are no real answers.
*  And Mastavskoy simply ends up being killed.
*  The other characters going to the camps, they're simply killed.
*  There is no negotiation.
*  But if you look at the main Soviet interrogation scene when Katsenilin Bogan is interrogating
*  Krimov, a scene which goes on for quite a while, they talk back and forth.
*  It's weird.
*  It's sick.
*  It's twisted.
*  There's torture involved.
*  But actually, Krimov comes away from that scene alive.
*  He at least learns something.
*  And also you have figures, one of them is Viktor, another is Novikov, the tank commander.
*  Maybe they're imperfect, but they're not just all bad by any means.
*  They're virtuous in significant ways.
*  And fascism in this novel cannot create that.
*  Even the non-believers in fascism.
*  What's the fellow's name?
*  Akhanikov?
*  No, no, no.
*  He's a German.
*  Do I have this in my notes?
*  He doesn't really believe in Nazism, but he ends up going around raping Russian women.
*  And that's the fascist version of someone who's not a believer, not nearly as good as
*  the Soviet version.
*  So I think he knows he rooted for the USSR to win the war.
*  And in part in this novel, he's trying to explain to himself, how could you root for
*  such a horrible society?
*  And how could it have been on the side of the Allies, which of course we would have
*  been rooting for at the time.
*  And that I think is part of his answer, the central idea of negotiability, that it never
*  quite goes away under communism.
*  And even Viktor is saved by this weird intervention from Stalin, which makes no sense.
*  But there's some outcome possible other than just death and destruction.
*  Yeah, I want to come back to the torture theme, the scenes in the Lubyanka with Kremov.
*  I've read a lot of Solzhenitsyn, I've read all the Gulag, I've read many of his novels.
*  I've read about a lot of scenes in the Lubyanka.
*  You know, I can't say I feel like I've been there, but it's familiar to me.
*  It's the prison where people were tormented, not merely tortured, but tortured until they
*  confessed often.
*  Sometimes tortured until they confessed things that weren't true, sometimes tortured until
*  they confessed about loved ones or comrades or colleagues.
*  It's an unbearable tragic place.
*  And having read all that before, I felt reading Grossman's account, an awareness of how hard
*  it was to stay on your principles.
*  It's almost, yes, they tortured their victims and they extracted confessions under torture.
*  But by the end, you feel like Grossman captured this idea that for many of them, they were
*  glad to confess, even though they knew what they did wasn't what they confessed to wasn't
*  true.
*  But they did it out of love for the system.
*  And all the purge, the show trials of the 30s, which in 1938, just in 37 keep coming
*  back into this book, all the trial and the purges before that, where Stalin's opponents
*  were systematically killed.
*  None of them were killed at night, the firing squad, or with a murderer.
*  They all confessed.
*  What Grossman captures, which is I've never really read it with this level of intensity,
*  the willingness of people to confess, even though they know it's not true, what they're
*  confessing to, because they think the system itself is worth preserving.
*  They have a, you know, I would make a distinction, it's a Dostoevskyian distinction between the
*  church and its practitioners, right?
*  It's a little bit reminds me of the grand inquisitor scene.
*  The people who, the officers of the church, and here I'm talking about not any particular
*  church but any religious dogma, they're flawed.
*  They've lost the original doctrine that inspired the believers.
*  But the idea of giving up that doctrine is so painful to the adherents that they confess
*  the things they didn't do because they have to believe that the system, the church still
*  stands, in this case, a secular church, the Church of Communism.
*  Do you feel that?
*  It's a profound book on the psychology of confession.
*  And I think another element of how people come to confess is that in part they believe
*  they are guilty.
*  They may not believe they're fully guilty, but if you think of Krimov, if you reread
*  the earlier parts of the book, he does in fact whine about his colleagues in such a
*  minor way.
*  But that looms larger and larger in his mind as they talk to him.
*  And he starts wondering, well have I in fact done something against the system when confronted
*  with the power of the interrogator and of course the indirect reference to Dostoevsky
*  and how the system ex-ante takes advantage of what a Christian might call original sin,
*  to put people in positions where they almost cannot help but confess because they believed
*  something to begin with.
*  And then the theme that passivity underlies how so many social structures operate, the
*  novel is quite profound on, including how the camps operate, how an army battalion
*  operates, how chains of command operate in the military, that the default of passivity
*  is responsible for so much of social order, even when that social order can be very, very
*  bad.
*  By the way, it's Lieutenant Peter Bach, who's the German I was referring to in my earlier
*  comment.
*  And I should just mention, as you've already alluded to, there are many historically real
*  characters in the book mixed in with the fictional ones, and the list of characters distinguishes
*  those.
*  And there's another parallel between the Soviet and the Nazi systems that I found just fascinating.
*  Each side has its own hall monitors in the middle of a war.
*  So you're fighting a war, it's life or death, and yet there's a commissar, meaning an operative
*  of the Communist Party on the Russian side, Soviet side, and on the German side, you've
*  got the SS.
*  And they're both looking to uncover a sense of errors and dogma errors.
*  They're looking for heresy, whether it's negative remarks about Stalin or Hitler, or something
*  nice about the Jews, they're all looking for things to crack down on.
*  And it's such a handicap in a war.
*  Novikov, of course, has incredible moments of this.
*  But the idea that you would hamper your war effort with ideological purity questions,
*  and that both sides did, at least in Grossman's version, was really eye-opening for me.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  One thing I found striking in the book is just how many literary references there are,
*  and they all seem relevant.
*  So one thing I did was when reading through, I tried to note what was mentioned twice.
*  The Tolstoy is mentioned more than once, but there's this Chekhov short story called The
*  Bishop, which it's not only mentioned twice, but we're told, you know, you must go away
*  and read The Bishop.
*  So of course I went away and read The Bishop.
*  And The Bishop is about dying, and it's about what is transient in life.
*  It's about the fragility of a social reputation.
*  It's about a mother-child bond, and that when the bishop, who is well known in his lifetime,
*  people were not sure he had ever been there.
*  But the one person he had been real to was his mother, and that was more important than
*  his social role as a bishop.
*  And that's the Chekhov story that he takes greatest care to point us to.
*  And I think so much of the novel is about motherhood.
*  It's Vera giving birth that is heralding the turn of the tide with the Battle of Stalingrad
*  itself.
*  And life is again possible that the Soviets start to win.
*  It's a great insight.
*  Victor, the main character, sort of, one of the main characters in the book, receives
*  a letter from his mother on her way to her death in a Nazi death camp.
*  It's quite powerful.
*  It goes on for, I don't know, 10 pages or so.
*  One of the best parts of the book.
*  Maybe the most moving, yeah.
*  And Grossman writes this really imagining what his own mother would have written had
*  she been able to write to him before her death in the murders of Praditya in 1941 that I
*  mentioned earlier.
*  This is just stunning.
*  Grossman wrote two letters to his mother, his actual mother, after her death.
*  One he wrote nine years after his mother died and one he wrote 20 years after his mother
*  died right before his own death.
*  And we have those letters.
*  They're in the back of a collection of Grossmans we're going to talk about in a future episode
*  called The Road.
*  And they're deeply moving.
*  He believed and said in his letter, I think in the letters, that his mother would stay,
*  would be eternal because of life and fate, which makes it even more poignant that at
*  the time of his death, he didn't know that the book would survive.
*  But he clearly, motherhood is a major theme in the book.
*  Sophia's scene, the doctor in the death camp, is also overwhelming.
*  And he clearly, he was fascinated by maternal love.
*  What do you make of the fact that the very final chapter is characters who have no names
*  whatsoever?
*  That reminds me a bit of the Chekhov story.
*  So I took that to be, well, in some longer run, none of the particular identities of
*  these individuals will be remembered.
*  That simply the life and fate of humanity goes on and it's people, in essence, without
*  names.
*  That's beautiful.
*  I didn't have any thoughts on that other than that.
*  I was expecting something more dramatic.
*  I like how you've made that different.
*  I wondered whether he'd had a chance to really edit the final version before it was confiscated.
*  But I like your ending better.
*  I think it's deliberately not dramatic.
*  It's as far from drama as you can get in a way.
*  Yeah, that's nice.
*  Stendhal is also mentioned several times, A Charterhouse of Parma, which is a book about
*  war and individual fate.
*  And I strongly suspect all of the literary references have some meaning to Grossman.
*  So there's Dante and Swift and Homer and Huck Finn, which are all about journeys.
*  And he's taking us, like on our journey through this war, through this battle, through Soviet
*  and Nazi life.
*  I think that's another way he thought of the book.
*  Dante with the Rungs of Hell.
*  Obviously we're seeing the 20th century version of the Rungs of Hell and so on.
*  Yeah, it's really a nice way to put it.
*  There's no clean narrative thread.
*  And it captures the chaos of war that way.
*  The characters who move away come back.
*  They're often homeless.
*  They're thrown out of their own houses.
*  They're forced to take in a border who's richer than they are, more connected than
*  they are, and they're pushed into a smaller room in the back.
*  They leave their family and yearn to come back.
*  So there is this constant theme of journey and home.
*  And everyone in the book is unsettled, not just by the war.
*  Their own emotional journey is troubled.
*  Victor's marriage, as Grossman's marriage was, is deeply complicated.
*  There's a lot of betrayal in the book as well.
*  And at the same time, there's a lot of kindness.
*  And I'll just mention, because you say maybe the most powerful passage of the book, there's
*  so many.
*  One of my favorite passages, I'm not going to read it, I want to spoil it, but it's about
*  an act of senseless kindness, an act of kindness that a Russian woman does for a German soldier
*  that she actually says out loud to her friends, she says, I can't explain it.
*  And this idea of senseless kindness standing in the universe up against evil, it says it
*  explicitly.
*  Let me see if I can find this passage.
*  He says, the private kindness of one individual towards another, a petty, thoughtless kindness,
*  an unwitnessed kindness, something we would call senseless kindness, a kindness outside
*  any system of social or religious good.
*  But if we think about it, we realize that this private, senseless, incidental kindness
*  is in fact eternal.
*  It is extended to everything living, even to a mouse, even to a bent branch that a man
*  straightens as he walks by.
*  That's another theme of the book.
*  And he, even when we might weight evil in its magnitude, dwarfing these small acts,
*  he takes them and he elevates them.
*  He makes them shine for us so that in his view, they're the whole thing.
*  Tanner Greer said on Twitter, he thinks kindness is the central theme of the novel.
*  There's also a part on page 283 where Grossman gives what I think is just his solution, his
*  intellectual ideological solution to the whole mess.
*  And of course, he cites Chekhov.
*  So let me just read a short part here.
*  Chekhov is the bearer of the greatest banner that has been raised in the thousand years
*  of Russian history, the banner of a true humane Russian democracy, of Russian freedom, of
*  the dignity of the Russian man.
*  Our Russian humanism has always been cruel, intolerant, sectarian.
*  And he talks about the partisans, the fanatics, and he thinks Tolstoy is also an intolerant
*  fanatic.
*  But Chekhov says, quote, let's put God and all these grand progressive ideas to one side.
*  Let's begin with man.
*  Let's be kind and attentive to the individual man.
*  And that I think is his bottom line.
*  And that too comes from Chekhov.
*  And then he cites Chekhov's book about prison camp, Sakhalin Island, which is also a fantastic
*  story.
*  What other themes did you want to mention that we haven't talked about?
*  It's the notion of what people will put up with and how they deal with it, of how they
*  will keep on absorbing indignities and the sort of set point.
*  You could say it gets reset and then something else happens and something else happens.
*  And he's so psychologically astute in presenting that in a wide variety of settings for different
*  people, whether it's interrogation, torture, being in the camp, seeing your child suffer.
*  It's one of the hardest things about this novel to read.
*  There's so many instances of it.
*  And any one of them is heartbreaking.
*  And you keep on seeing it again and again.
*  I take it you found that hard as well.
*  Well, it's funny.
*  I think anyone listening to this, what we've said so far would say, boy, this is a depressing
*  book.
*  Right?
*  It's about death in war, death under the Nazis, death under the communists.
*  I did not find it depressing.
*  I did not find it a dark read.
*  Let me expand on that a little bit and I want your reaction.
*  Yes, people go through horrible things.
*  But one of the themes of the book is the resilience of the human spirit.
*  And he talks about explicitly in a few places, he talks about the desire to live, even when
*  you think it's, quote, hopeless.
*  He talks about how people do things that are not going to have an impact for months and
*  years, even though they think they're about to die.
*  But they do them anyway.
*  You know, the human circus or whatever you want to call it, parade goes on.
*  But I don't find it.
*  It's weird to say this.
*  I didn't find it a particularly dark book.
*  I was not depressed or down.
*  I found it a nice example of what I talked about with Susan Cain.
*  I found it a very bittersweet book because there's a lot of life in it.
*  How would you do you agree with that?
*  I don't find many things depressing.
*  It is tough to read.
*  And I think most ordinary readers, if you just pulled them, they would say this is depressing.
*  But that the book itself exists is part of the ultimate reason why it's not depressing,
*  that the book managed to survive.
*  And that's a testament to some of the negotiable elements in the Soviet system.
*  Even though they tried to destroy it, you have to wonder how hard did they try.
*  When you read the stories of how it survived, it seems maybe they could have destroyed it
*  if they had truly wanted to.
*  And one thing I'm struck by, you know, the terror reign of Stalin more generally, for
*  all the terrible things he did, he had some modest tendency to protect his geniuses, whether
*  it was Pesternak or Prokofiev or Shostakovich or Grossman.
*  Those are not the people he killed.
*  Babel was killed.
*  But the geniuses tend to survive and they're able to do something, however twisted it may
*  have been or whatever circuitous path it had to go through to come out and be shown to
*  the public.
*  Maybe Shostakovich is the clearest example of that.
*  It's really interesting.
*  Obviously he was ruthless with respect to his political rivals.
*  Not just Kulaks, right?
*  He killed many, many millions of Kulaks.
*  I'm talking about his colleagues from the early days of the revolution.
*  He brutally killed them as and as I suggested, as I said earlier, he killed them after having
*  them confess first, which I don't know if that was gelding the lily or not for him,
*  whether that added to the to the delight that he found in that.
*  But I don't know if he protected his geniuses.
*  He certainly didn't generally let them thrive.
*  He forced them to conform to his own movement standards.
*  There's a page, we mentioned it when we agreed to do this.
*  It's page 217 on artificial intelligence.
*  What did you make of that?
*  I loved it.
*  You know, I don't agree with every word of it, but it's so I don't know if it's prescience,
*  that's the right word, but it's it.
*  It was eerie.
*  It was one of the two most intellectually interesting things in the book for me as opposed
*  to literary emotional power.
*  We'll come back to the second in a second.
*  You want to read that passage?
*  It's a great passage.
*  It's a whole chapter.
*  It's the whole chapter.
*  It's only a couple of paragraphs.
*  I'll read part of it.
*  Quote, an electronic machine may carry out mathematical calculations.
*  Remember historical facts.
*  It can make H.S. and translate books from one language to another.
*  It is able to solve mathematical problems more quickly than man and its memory is faultless.
*  Is there any limit to progress to its ability to create machines in the image and likeness
*  of man?
*  It seems that the answer is no.
*  And there's more, but that's just the opening part.
*  There was, of course, throughout the 1960s, a Soviet obsession with artificial intelligence
*  that we often forget in the West.
*  That they as a regime were convinced it was going to be the future.
*  It pops up a great deal in Soviet science fiction.
*  There's that book about the science city in Siberia that was created by the Soviets.
*  There's a whole chapter in that book about what they were trying to do with AI.
*  It was one of their top priorities.
*  Obviously they didn't get very far.
*  But Grossman is showing he was swept up in that mania.
*  But I think what he says on this page is true, except for the memory being faultless.
*  We know that's not true.
*  There are still hallucinations.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, today.
*  We'll get there maybe.
*  Today.
*  Yeah.
*  And he wrote that in probably late 1950s, sometime in the 1950s, which you talk about
*  the Soviet interest in AI.
*  There wasn't much AI in those early days.
*  But he was fascinated clearly.
*  That page doesn't really change much of the book, if at all.
*  He just threw that in there because he was interested in it.
*  It's not thrown in there.
*  It's there for a reason.
*  Let's talk about that reason.
*  Yeah, tell me.
*  Well, the very last sentence on that page, which is its own paragraph, quote, fascism
*  annihilated tens of millions of people.
*  So before that, he's mentioning that the AI machine will be so large, he didn't know
*  Moore's law, that it might take up the entire surface of the earth.
*  And there might not be room for humans on earth, I think is what he's saying.
*  So I think he's worried about artificial intelligence, and he views it as potentially the new fascism.
*  That's how I took the section.
*  No, I think that's fair.
*  I think that's fair.
*  So he's saying fascism doesn't go away.
*  It comes back in many forms.
*  There are always forces that can enslave or destroy mankind.
*  And he worried, I'm speculating here, about his own regime's embrace of the AI program.
*  So he's like an early illeaser.
*  Or a worry about technology.
*  I think his worries about the analogies making there between fascism and technology that
*  they enslave us.
*  I don't think enslave us the way our phones enslave us, but they have the potential to
*  be a system.
*  I think of the man of system, the Adam Smith quote from the Theory of Moral Sentiments,
*  this idea that if you have a view of the world that you want to impose on the chessboard
*  of the human experience, you're going to do some bad things.
*  And I take it to be in that spirit.
*  Note also that the middle paragraph where he's talking about humans, he cites first
*  childhood memories a bit later on, a mother's tenderness, thoughts of death.
*  So the main themes of the novel are being echoed by this interlude where he is contrasting
*  humans to the machine.
*  And the machine for him eventually becomes all powerful.
*  It becomes a kind of god, can create humans in its image that are in a way superior.
*  And I think he's terrified by this.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like I am a little bit.
*  And yeah, fair enough.
*  It didn't mean to suggest it didn't belong at all.
*  It's just a wonderful little interlude.
*  And I think I was overwhelmed by the fact that it seems like most of it could have been
*  written yesterday.
*  The other part that I just was fascinated by was his comparison of fascism to quantum
*  mechanics and the cutting edge of physics.
*  What were your thoughts on that analogy?
*  I want your thoughts on that.
*  But this idea that scientific metaphor and scientific narrative and the way we see our
*  role in the universe doesn't just affect the progress of science, it comes into our culture
*  in all kinds of ways.
*  That's a very provocative idea.
*  I think it's the same theme.
*  So I read him as basically a humanist like Chekhov, fairly skeptical about science.
*  So Victor, yes, you could say is hero or certainly center of the novel.
*  But what ends up happening is Victor, this is not too much of a spoiler because we know
*  what did happen, ends up helping Stalin build nuclear weapons.
*  And he can't be too thrilled by that.
*  He may see a positive side that the motherland could be defended against future fascists.
*  But I think he has strongly mixed feelings about that.
*  And Victor is co-opted by something that Grossman himself does not quite believe in.
*  And the scientific mentality is part of the problem.
*  So the way science operates in the novel and in this society, there's more betrayal in
*  science than anywhere else.
*  You're highly at risk in science.
*  And I don't think he feels that's entirely accidental to science or fully the fault of
*  communism.
*  Victor's character deals relentlessly and painfully with the ethical dilemmas of being a favored
*  citizen of the state, very similar to in the first circle where the characters are, they're
*  in a gulag, but it's a privileged gulag because they're doing research that benefits the state,
*  which puts them as the prisoners in a very unpleasant ethical situation, which is really
*  the essence of that book.
*  You know, in this case.
*  Another thing that Grossman captures, I thought, with such accuracy and lets you feel it is
*  the exhilaration of scientific discovery.
*  Victor makes a discovery.
*  The exact nature of it isn't described, but he's clearly on the cutting edge.
*  And as you say, it may lead to many things, but it's mainly a theoretical discovery.
*  And there's an ego part to it, but most of it's just, he's just pushed out the frontiers
*  of human knowledge.
*  And it's an incredible part of the human experience.
*  He's just, he's so alive after that.
*  And his mood so oscillates with his ability to do that or not do it, depending on his,
*  whether he's in a favored status with respect to the regime.
*  And so I think that's just so much more part of his psychological trials and tribulations,
*  the ability to have that freedom or lose it clashing with his, with the pressure the
*  regime puts him under to serve its own purposes.
*  That to me is this is an enormous part of his, his character's dilemma.
*  But I think Grossman's also writing at a time where many, many intelligent people think
*  science perhaps is about to end the world.
*  So there's that possibly apocryphal story that some of the people at the Rand Corporation,
*  the decision theorists, not all of them put money into their retirement accounts because
*  they thought it wouldn't be necessary.
*  A nuclear war would come.
*  It's an extremely common view amongst the elite.
*  And I think he held a Soviet version of that.
*  And that pops up in the novel that yes, you're rooting for Victor, but there's something about
*  the logic of what went wrong that can so easily end up being recreated, but at a more destructive
*  level.
*  And that's in the background of this novel.
*  But I think it's another reason why maybe I find it a bit less, I don't think heartwarming
*  isn't the word, but a bit less inspirational than one could otherwise make it out to be.
*  We can't get rid of science.
*  And Grossman himself is never quite reassured about science.
*  And that one page about AI is put in there to tell us that.
*  That's nice.
*  I agree with that.
*  It's very nice, Tyler.
*  He's got an essay in The Road, which we may talk about in a future episode,
*  where he looks at a painting of Raphael's called Sistine Madonna.
*  And in the Sistine Madonna, Mary is holding the baby Jesus and pushing him forward.
*  And she does it, it's a very Grossman painting because it's about a mother's love for her
*  child and her willingness to put the child in harm's way.
*  There's a lot more to say about that.
*  But in that essay, Grossman talks explicitly about the hydrogen bomb.
*  The essay was written in 1955.
*  And he clearly, which is about the time I think he was writing some of this book.
*  So you're 100% right that the potential for human beings to be extinct and destroy themselves
*  is very much in his consciousness.
*  One thing I've been thinking about is the question to what extent
*  is this Soviet novel, Jewish novel, Ukrainian novel, or Russian novel.
*  And often it's thought of as a Russian novel.
*  I'm not sure how much it is because he's clearly not ethnic Russian.
*  So how does the patriotic side of this
*  differ from how a Russian writer would have presented the same?
*  I've been pondering.
*  I don't have a clear answer.
*  But that's another undercurrent in the book that it's very subtly not entirely Russian per se.
*  Well, his Jewishness was not always front and center in his mind.
*  He was forced to confront it as the Holocaust arrived.
*  And eventually as the Soviets, Stalin accused Jewish doctors of trying to kill him.
*  And so there's a strong anti-Semitic thread in Soviet and Russian life.
*  And it's not a Jewish novel, I don't think.
*  I wouldn't call it that.
*  But it is written by a Jewish Ukrainian living in a Soviet state.
*  So in that sense, with a Russian culture.
*  So in that sense, in a certain sense, I think it's the ultimate Russian novel.
*  It's polyphonic.
*  It's about life and fate.
*  So there's really few things more Russian than that.
*  And yet at the same time, he writes as a Jew.
*  And the Jewish parts of the book, which are not that many,
*  but he gives you a flavor of what it's like to live in a place where anti-Semitism can be openly
*  espoused.
*  And it's painful for some of the characters.
*  They try to hide their Jewishness at times.
*  And of course, we have the Shoah, the Nazi, the Holocaust going on at the same time,
*  which, you know, an editor would probably might have said to him, you know,
*  the book's got a lot in it already.
*  Do you need to put that in?
*  But he did.
*  He did need to put that in.
*  And so that's a good question, Tyler.
*  Tyler Larkin It strikes me as more Jewish than you're making it out to be.
*  Not in the religious sense, but the notion of how tragedy is possible
*  and how tragedy can befall you in quite arbitrary ways,
*  or the sudden twists and turns of fate, come very much from the Hebrew Bible, I think.
*  He probably was aware of that, but he must have been brought up learning it.
*  And for me, it's a highly Jewish novel, not only by any means.
*  It's a universal novel above everything else.
*  It's interesting to me, my wife, Natasha, a Jew from the Soviet Union,
*  this and Master and Margarita are her two favorite novels.
*  And that she so much relates to this.
*  It tells me something, because she's uneasy with a lot of what you might call purely Russian fiction,
*  including Tolstoy, very uneasy with Tolstoy.
*  It's only one data point, but worth thinking about.
*  Tyler Larkin Yeah, that's interesting.
*  I was going to say when you talked about the twists and turns,
*  it makes it more of a Yiddish novel.
*  Tom Coghlan Well, that, of course,
*  Pal of Settlement.
*  Tyler Larkin Yeah, it wasn't written in Yiddish,
*  but there's a certain, I'll say it a different way to take it a little more seriously.
*  There's a certain fatalism in Jewish fate, a feeling that we are the endlessly the punching
*  bags of the rest of the world, and that is our fate.
*  Obviously, we're living in a moment where the world's a little different with the
*  current situation in Israel.
*  But I think the characters in Life and Fate obviously do feel that they are
*  beleaguered, and that has a certain Yiddish flavor to that that I can't explain.
*  Tom Coghlan But also consider the Book of Job.
*  You know, who can himself or herself actually defend what he or she has done in the eyes of God
*  is another underlying theme in this book.
*  And is it Victor, in fact, not entirely clear, even though he's the center,
*  mostly a sympathetic character?
*  Who really is doing right under the eyes of God is highly unclear, I think, in Life and Fate.
*  Tyler Larkin Oh, I agree.
*  But it's just, we shouldn't mislead readers.
*  There's very little God in this book.
*  He doesn't mention God a lot.
*  God looms over the book to some extent, indirectly, implicitly,
*  but what it means to be a human being and to live a life that is defensible,
*  whether it's to God or to your friends or to whomever is a central part of this book.
*  Grossman himself.
*  Again, no spoilers here, but look up Grossman's entries.
*  In Wikipedia, articles were written about him that have been written about him.
*  There's a nice article in 2006 in The New Yorker by Keith Gessen.
*  Grossman himself did some things he was deeply ashamed of.
*  He was ashamed, I think, as far as we know, that he didn't get his mother out of Pridichiv
*  and that she'd perish there at the hands of the Nazis in 1941.
*  He does sign some things publicly that benefit the regime that he, I think, regrets,
*  and Victor goes through very similar throws of conscience.
*  Let me talk a bit about how I read this book, which was extremely absorbing,
*  highly worthwhile, but it was tough.
*  One thing I did that helped more than anything else was an extensive use of large language models,
*  in particular the 01 version of GPT.
*  So whenever I would come across a name and not feel I had a full command of what that person had done,
*  I would just ask GPT, give me the account of what this person did in the book.
*  I did that dozens of times, as you mentioned many characters.
*  I didn't catch any hallucinations, actually.
*  It was extremely useful.
*  I don't think I could have read the book nearly as well as I read it without doing that.
*  Interestingly, there's one character where it just failed.
*  It delivered for me dozens of times, but when I asked it about Vera, like tell me the story of Vera,
*  it just gave me back the, oh, I'm a large language model.
*  I don't know who Vera is, you know, check your other sources.
*  I don't know why, but other than that, it was flawless and highly useful.
*  Well, she doesn't get a lot of airtime and she hasn't written about a lot,
*  so it might have had trouble finding any kind of references to her.
*  As you point out, she plays a very powerful symbolic role,
*  but she doesn't take up a lot of pages.
*  I'll just mention, I mentioned the essay a minute ago, The Sistine Madonna.
*  I asked Jack GPT what it was about, and it totally got it wrong.
*  It said it was about beauty and art.
*  It is not what it is about at all.
*  Claude got it right exactly, which is just maybe neither here nor there,
*  other than it's good to have sometimes two LLMs to ask questions of.
*  I found my reading of the book was very inconsistent.
*  I struggled in the early pages, as I mentioned, to get my momentum going.
*  You know, when I read Brothers Caramazzo, I read it over a fairly long period of time,
*  but the last three or four hundred pages I read in a couple days,
*  because they were so, it's such a page-turner.
*  This book is not a page-turner.
*  As I said, you might get discouraged, but I found myself more, if I may say so, engrossed in it,
*  engrossed in a Grossman novel.
*  There's no, there's almost no, very little narrative suspense.
*  We know how the Battle of Stalingrad turns out, the tide turns, and I found it interesting that
*  the Novikov, I think, is part of the lead tank group going into Ukraine, and he's very excited
*  to reclaim Ukraine for the Soviets and take it back from the Germans.
*  It was a slightly eerie shadow of the current moment, but I, I think it's interesting,
*  I just kept going.
*  One of my followers on Twitter, I apologize to you because this is such a good joke,
*  and we'll put a link to it in the show notes, we don't have it, but he,
*  when I said, we're reading this book, you should get started, it's going to air soon,
*  he wrote back, all the characters, he said, I'm on page 12,
*  and all the characters are named Stroganov, I need more time.
*  The names are hard.
*  The names are hard.
*  Here's the other thing I did, and this was difficult, but once I finished it,
*  the next day I started over again in page one, re-read the whole thing, I'm a big advocate of
*  doing that, and I realized I had understood very little of the first two or three hundred pages
*  the first time I read it.
*  Not that I didn't understand the words, but I didn't understand how any of it fit into the story,
*  and I don't think you can.
*  It's not a question of, well, if I'd been a better reader, or had paid more attention,
*  or been less distracted by the dog, I just think many books, the best thing you do is read them
*  twice directly in a row, and as you get to the latter third of the book, actually,
*  probably you could stop, you don't have to re-read the last third,
*  but certainly the first half, you just have to do it again.
*  So I read this version, I'm holding this up for YouTubers.
*  Yeah, me too, same.
*  Same print, same publisher, it's New York Review Books Press, who reissued a lot of grossmen.
*  It's about 872 pages, we haven't actually mentioned that, it's really long,
*  and I should also mention there's a prequel, which was issued initially under the title
*  For A Just Cause, that you can read in English under the title of Stalingrad, which is confusing,
*  because the life of the people say is about Stalingrad, but he wrote a book called Stalingrad
*  in English anyway, that's also about 900 pages. I may read that next. It's funny,
*  when I finished the book, I had the exact same urge, and I'm not a re-reader the way you are,
*  Tyler, I thought, I want to read this again, and I want to do justice to it.
*  There's a certain, I felt a certain ethical virtue in honoring this man who had written this book,
*  and to give it even a second reading, but I felt, I should read the road,
*  this collection of shorter pieces that he wrote in preparation for our conversation,
*  but I wanted to read it again. I hope I will read it again.
*  You know, there's great, great novels from the 20s, there's Thomas Mann, there's Proust,
*  James Joyce from around that time. I think it's hard to compare this to those,
*  but if you think of the somewhat latter part of the 20th century,
*  this has a claim to be the best novel of a very, very important century.
*  And it's remarkable how few people know it. I wouldn't say it's a page-turner,
*  but I never lost interest, I would say that, not once. I was never thinking, well, if I wasn't
*  doing this podcast with Russ, would I keep on going? Just was never a question. So in that sense,
*  it was a page-turner for me. I want to make sure I say this, Tyler,
*  I'm very grateful you agreed to do this because I think the quote is from William F. Buckley.
*  I want to say it's Moby Dick, I might get it wrong, but he said, he read it late in life,
*  and he said, it would have made me really sad to have died without reading this book.
*  And that's the way I feel about life and fate. I feel it would have been a loss for me
*  not to have finished it. I read the book in a very strange way, by the way. I read it
*  both on my phone, on my Kindle app, where I highlighted profusely. And then I read it
*  on Shabbat, on the Jewish Sabbath, when I couldn't use my Kindle, I read the paper version.
*  And you can see where I bent down page corners, I'm holding this up for YouTube watchers,
*  I bent down page corners thinking naively I would go back and re-highlight those in
*  the Kindle version because they were so good. It's a compulsion I have, it doesn't really make sense.
*  I'm glad I read both ways, they were both helpful.
*  Pete Slauson Did you ever get in touch with Robert Chandler, the translator?
*  Tyler I did.
*  Pete Slauson What did you learn?
*  Tyler He's scheduled to appear on this program shortly. I want to talk to him about two things,
*  I want to talk to him about The Road, which he edited, he translated it and edited it.
*  And I also want to talk to him about the art of translation. And obviously, we'll talk a little
*  bit about life and fate and passing. But I'll put an ad in for The Road. The Road has short stories
*  of Grossman, it has his remarkable essay on Treblinka. It's about a 40, 50 page essay on
*  entering Treblinka, he was the first journalist to enter a death camp.
*  Pete Slauson That's a must read for anyone.
*  Tyler It's an incredible essay. But the short stories are really lovely. The short story,
*  The Road is a short story from the perspective of a donkey, which, and it's interesting,
*  Tolstoy wrote a wonderful short story called The Pace Setter that is life from the perspective of
*  horse. I assume Grossman was riffing on that in some way, this idea that this dumb, meaning mute,
*  creature, that its observations of the human being might be more accurate than our own
*  and give us insight is really a beautiful idea. So, that's, and it's also peppered with lovely
*  pieces from Chandler with biographical detail. So, I can't imagine what it's like to, I'll ask him,
*  but to translate a book of this size, which of course, you know, Russian translators are
*  doing this all day long, Constance Garnett and others are translating very large books from a
*  very different language, it must be a fascinating experience. I'm sure it took longer to translate
*  than it took me to read it. So, I'll be interested. I want you to ask him how funny is the book in
*  Russian? Because in English, it's basically not funny. But I hear my wife tell jokes in Russian
*  to her friends all the time. Everyone laughs. I get an English translation. It's not funny. I suspect
*  the joke in fact was funny. So, Russian jokes don't translate well. That's what I want you to ask him.
*  Another thought I had on the question of how is this not quite a Russian novel, though it's in
*  the Russian language. If I think of Tolstoy a lot in Russian culture, he even says this about Tolstoy,
*  Dostoevsky, Scriabin, it's fanatical of different sorts. Obviously, the Bolsheviks were fanatical.
*  And this novel is extremely anti-fanatical. It's like Montaigne in France, right? It's like
*  Chekhov is his model for how to be an anti-fanatic. So, part of what he's doing, I think,
*  is trying to retell Tolstoy, but from a humanist, anti-fanatical point of view.
*  Steve McLaughlin I feel a certain fanaticism about, certainly,
*  Solzhenitsyn, certainly about Dostoevsky. What do you find? I can think of a few things that
*  are fanatical about Tolstoy. What comes to mind? Richard Lange
*  Well, his views on everything were extreme. Beethoven, Shakespeare, religion, property.
*  It's hard to think of a more fanatical human being.
*  Steve McLaughlin Sex, God, marriage, yeah, it's true.
*  Richard Lange He'd make a great podcast guest,
*  but where would you even start? Dostoevsky, clearly a fanatic. From the biography, from his works,
*  if you read Armenian Sketchbook, which is also a great short book to read by him, he just seems so
*  much not a fanatic. And that's the most inspiring thing for me about this novel, that you can be,
*  for him, committed to principles and morality and not a fanatic. And he's pulling that from Chekhov.
*  And when you're from the smaller part of the empire, you're probably going to be less fanatical.
*  It's a bit like Americans and Canadians, perhaps. And that, to me, really shone through in Life and
*  Fate, the anti-fanaticism. Steve McLaughlin
*  Let me ask you a personal question. I really like that, by the way. It's a certain detachment
*  is the way I would describe it. His anti-fanaticism takes the form of a detachment
*  of the observer who hovers over his characters and describes them calmly without overdoing it.
*  I'm less fanatical than when I was younger. Would that be true of you?
*  Richard Lange Of course. I mean, it's true for almost everyone.
*  But especially if you have libertarian roots. Well, no, it's not true of almost everyone. But
*  if you have libertarian roots, you either go crazy or you become less extreme, right?
*  Steve McLaughlin What do you mean, right? Expand.
*  Richard Lange Well, we each know some people who just
*  went crazy. Often in non-libertarian directions, some of them become oddly enough fans of Putin
*  while we're on the Russian topic, or they just stop believing in scientific argument and discourse.
*  But the saner thing to do, and you see this with many people from the progressive left as well,
*  is just to become more moderate, more uncertain, to have better epistemic practices,
*  and take a broader swathe of history more seriously. And I think Grossman is doing that.
*  How much of history he's taking seriously, not just the one point in front of his eyes,
*  Battle of Stalingrad, but the AI section, whether you agree or not, he's looking to the future.
*  He's definitely looking to the Russian and Soviet past as well, the Ukrainian past,
*  Jewish history, the Hebrew Bible. So it's spanning a lot. And that's one reason why I think it's
*  epistemically pretty non or anti-fanatical and pretty rational.
*  Steve McLaughlin So I have a couple of fanaticisms. I've got my libertarian
*  flavor and my religious observance. And they both become tempered in some dimension as I've gotten
*  older. I don't think it's to avoid insanity, by the way. I'm curious.
*  Pete Slauson That wasn't why you did it. But if you hadn't done it.
*  Steve McLaughlin Yeah, maybe.
*  Pete Slauson But people who don't do it can just get worse, right?
*  Steve McLaughlin I'm curious why you think that is. Why do you think people,
*  because I don't think it's true, by the way. You did suggest it might not be. It's not obvious to
*  me that people get less fanatic as they get older. In fact, you know, supposedly as people get older,
*  it's not my personal experience. I'm grateful for that. But a lot of people, when they get older,
*  just get crankier and they get more obsessed with their obsessions, more fanatical about
*  their fanaticisms. I think I've been spared that. But why do you think that happens?
*  Steve McLaughlin I think I should have said it's a bimodal distribution,
*  that you go one way or another. Look at it this way, in the simplest Bayesian model,
*  your views should be a random walk. That the recent evolution of your views shouldn't predict
*  where you'll end up tomorrow. But that's not the case really with anyone that I've ever met.
*  There's some kind of trend in your views. You're either getting more fanatical,
*  getting more moderate, getting more religious, more or less something. And that to me is one
*  of the most interesting facts about human belief, is how hard it is to find belief as a random walk.
*  So what's wrong with all of us? If you're getting more moderate all the time, that's wrong too.
*  That's a funny kind of, you could say almost fanaticism, where you ought to say,
*  well, I see the trend, so I'm just going to leap to where I ought to be. And then the next day,
*  maybe 50% chance I'll take a step back toward being more dogmatic or less moderate.
*  Again, that's not what we see from the moderates either.
*  I wonder how much of it is the fact that it's really convenient to have a system,
*  gives you something to shove into the box. You've got this black box that you take the world's
*  events and you've decided how they should be processed. And then something new comes along,
*  and you know how to deal with that because you've got this box. You've got all these
*  great examples from the past. And at some point for me, I just started thinking that maybe the
*  box doesn't work all the time. I think a lot of people love the box. It's a great source of
*  comfort, whether it's religion or ideology or other things. And maybe there's just something
*  peculiar about me. When you're younger, certainty is deeply comforting because the world's
*  a bit too complicated to deal with. It still is, but I'm just less certain.
*  Paul There's also a more charitable interpretation of what you're describing.
*  So think of yourself as working through problems, which is fine, right? And working through problems
*  takes some time. You can't every day pick up a new problem. So the problems you're working through,
*  as you, I wouldn't say solve them, but as you somewhat make progress on them, that's going to
*  give you some persistence in the deltas of how your beliefs change. And I'm not sure,
*  the pure Bayesian model might just be wrong. It's so far from actual human practice. Maybe we
*  shouldn't just damn humans for not meeting it, but realize there's structures to how you work
*  through things, and they are going to apply certain trends that go on for periods of time.
*  Paul I want to say anything else about this book,
*  about it as a, will it persist with you? Will you think about, I mean, I've had a number of the
*  stories and vignettes, I think will stick with me for a long, long time. I haven't talked about
*  many, many, many of them that I loved. I did not talk about. Reader, you will have to,
*  listener, you will have to read them for yourself and make your own list. But this book will haunt
*  me. And I wonder, part of it's because I'm reading it recently. I'm not haunted by
*  a lot of the books I read when I was younger, because I've forgotten most of the haunting parts,
*  and I read this recently, but it's quite an achievement in that way. I think it will,
*  it will last with me. Do you want to add anything else?
*  Paul You're living under wartime conditions in a way that I am not.
*  I would just say my reading opportunity costs are very high for me to read an 872 page book
*  twice in a row and be glad I did it. There's no higher endorsement I can give to a novel than that.
*  Paul I guess today has been Tyler Cowen. Tyler, thanks for being part of Econ Talk.
*  Russ, thank you for thinking of me for this and thinking I might be crazy enough to actually do
*  it. It's been a great, great pleasure, both the reading and the chatting with you.
*  Russ Ditto
