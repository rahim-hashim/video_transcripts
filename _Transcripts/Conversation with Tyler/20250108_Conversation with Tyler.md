# Will modern films stand the test of time?  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I)
*  Do you think there are Hollywood movies, recent ones, that 50 years from now will be viewed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=0.0s)]
*  as classics and still watched? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=5.3s)]
*  I'm not sure there will be, actually. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=8.02s)]
*  You know, that's my view. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=10.3s)]
*  In any art form there's like a golden era, or there's multiple in some cases. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=11.84s)]
*  Like if you take the art of painting, there was an enormous number of masterpieces produced [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=17.38s)]
*  between 1600 and say 1675. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=22.32s)]
*  The next 75 years, I don't think it's anywhere close to being comparable to that previous [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=26.08s)]
*  75 years when Rembrandt, Vel√°zquez, Vermeer, Rubens, all those were so spectacular. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  And I think painting didn't get a lot of momentum again until the 19th century when there was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=38.86s)]
*  new innovations which opened up new possibilities. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=43.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think that in film certain styles get played out and then eventually somebody [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  develops something new. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEeCVDqGj6I&t=52.3s)]
