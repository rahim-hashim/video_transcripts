# Garry Kasparov on AI, Chess, and the Future of Creativity | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc)
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=0.0s)]
*  bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=8.32s)]
*  Learn more at mercatus.org. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=12.56s)]
*  And for more conversations, including videos, transcripts, and upcoming dates, visit conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=15.16s)]
*  I'm here with Garry Kasparov. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=25.16s)]
*  Garry, of course, is the world's greatest chess player ever. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=26.96s)]
*  But more importantly, I think of him as a man who has never, ever shied away from a challenge. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  He is one of the least complacent people I know, truly brave and courageous. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=35.64s)]
*  He has a new book out. The title is Deep Thinking. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=40.68s)]
*  Garry, of course, himself is an extremely deep thinker in virtually all areas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  The subtitle is Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=48.16s)]
*  Whereas in Garry's previous book, While Winter Was Coming, this time around it's a little more cheery, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=53.72s)]
*  and at least in some regards, while finally spring has arrived. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=58.76s)]
*  Garry, thank you for coming on the podcast. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=62.36s)]
*  Thanks for inviting me. And you're right, yeah. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=64.76s)]
*  And this book is more cheery than the previous one. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=66.92s)]
*  So I thought it would be a good idea to keep a balance. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=70.36s)]
*  And I think in both cases, I went against the dominant trend at the moment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=75.16000000000001s)]
*  When Winter Is Coming was written and published, many people here in this country or in the free world, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=84.28s)]
*  they had doubts about my strong statements about Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=94.68s)]
*  Now, regarding this book, Deep Thinking, when I was writing the book, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  many people tend to believe Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and other pessimists who predicted a doomsday scenario [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=108.68s)]
*  when artificial intelligence would inevitably take over our world. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  And this time I took the opposite side, the optimistic side. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=126.16s)]
*  And this book was an attempt to write a real story of artificial intelligence and its connection to the game of chess. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=132.44s)]
*  Why the founding fathers of computer science like Alan Turing and Claude Shannon had such an affection for the game of chess, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  and why they believed that solving the game of chess, or more likely making machines capable of being strongest players, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=152.6s)]
*  could help them to solve the problems of artificial intelligence, and why, by the way, they were wrong. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you some of my questions. We'll start with topics related to your book. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  If we think of computer chess as a kind of project, along with AlphaGo, as somewhat of a referendum on human intelligence, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=167.88s)]
*  that is, for decades, even centuries, humans have been trying to solve chess and go and play it better [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=174.56s)]
*  and understand how the games work. And then artificial intelligence comes along, computer chess, and they teach us how far off we were. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=181.36s)]
*  So if you think of artificial intelligence as teaching us something about humans, what kind of mistakes we make, how smart we are, or how stupid we are, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=190.12s)]
*  how would you judge the results of these referenda? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=197.68s)]
*  I don't think the founding fathers of computer science had the same affection to go or shoggy, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=201.04s)]
*  because they were not familiar or had very little knowledge of these games that were played in other part of the world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=212.2s)]
*  Now, chess was a game that for centuries had kind of an ultimate sign, mark of unique intelligence. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=218.88s)]
*  And it was quite natural for them to look at the game of chess as the milestone for breaking up this mystery of human intelligence. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=231.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=245.0s)]
*  And what we discovered in 1997, when Deep Blue was successful in the match against current world champion, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=246.72s)]
*  and I was world champion at that time, that chess could be crunched by brute force once hardware got fast enough, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=256.96s)]
*  databases got big enough, algorithms got smart enough. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=269.04s)]
*  But even while Deep Blue was victorious, it was anything but intelligent. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Of course, you can start arguing about the definition of intelligence, because by the definition of its output, the grandmaster level chess, Deep Blue was intelligent. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  But at this incredible speed, at certain points, Deep Blue could reach a phenomenal speed of, even today it's phenomenal, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=291.92s)]
*  but 20 years ago it was mind boggling, of 200 million positions per second. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=301.6s)]
*  It offered us very little dreamt of insight into the mysteries of human intelligence. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=308.32s)]
*  So you think humans are smarter than we might have thought? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  No, it's just different because any game, whether it's chess or we can move on with Go or Shogi, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=316.84s)]
*  still offers us a very limited area of human intelligence. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=328.56s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, the way we're trying to understand who is better in a respective game, it will be a result. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  Win or loss. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=346.6s)]
*  And machines have the size of advantage because they, you may call it, have a steady hand. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=348.04s)]
*  Humans are vulnerable because we cannot keep the same level of vigilance required to play with the machines, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=357.48s)]
*  even if we understand chess as well as machines do, even if we can survive the brute force of calculation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=364.96s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the pressure on the human player facing the machine is simple and bearable. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=372.8s)]
*  So when humans are playing chess, and here I mean professional chess players, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=379.8s)]
*  what do you think is the major human systematic bias during the game? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=383.8s)]
*  Is it that they're not patient enough or they take too many chances, they don't take enough chances? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=387.12s)]
*  What's the bias in us as human beings across the board? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=391.44s)]
*  I don't think humans at the highest level are playing machines anymore. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=397.52s)]
*  So it's useless because you know the outcome. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=401.20000000000005s)]
*  Oh sure, but Karoana sits down against Nakamura. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=404.88000000000005s)]
*  What biases do they exhibit in their play? Psychological biases? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=407.72s)]
*  No, but are we talking about two humans? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=411.16s)]
*  Two humans. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=413.32000000000005s)]
*  No, that's another story because if you have two humans, then you have two individuals and most likely they know each other. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  I played, I guess, 182 games in the World Championship matches, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=422.0s)]
*  and many more games, hundreds of games against other top players in different competitions. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=427.16s)]
*  And I knew almost all my opponents, I knew what to expect from them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=432.88s)]
*  I knew what to expect from myself. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=436.88s)]
*  Human chess is a form of psychological warfare. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=439.6s)]
*  So it includes a psychological element because you should know how to play a game against a very specific opponent. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=444.44s)]
*  And sometimes, not very often, but sometimes you may look for certain moves that may not be the best purely from a chess point of view. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=451.96s)]
*  But they could create situations at chessboard that might push your opponent off balance. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  Now with machine, it's totally different. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=474.4s)]
*  And it's the humans are facing an opponent that is not vulnerable to any psychological pressure. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=477.16s)]
*  And moreover, opponent that doesn't care about what's happened one move ago. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=484.92s)]
*  In any human game, you always have not necessarily blunders or mistakes, but inaccuracies. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  Because if we are reaching winning position, complacency is hard to avoid. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=499.6s)]
*  So you think complacency is the main human bias you see in top chess games? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=507.24s)]
*  It's complacency if you're on a winning side, but it could be also the desperation if you're losing side. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=511.24s)]
*  One of the greatest problems against any machine is how to deliver the final blow, to win the game. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  Even if you're lucky and you get a very good position, then again, you have to play with precision that is not required in human chess. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=526.72s)]
*  So everything that you learn throughout your professional career, it just suddenly is working against you. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=534.12s)]
*  And my experience, and I'm talking about best games played by top players, tells me that inaccuracies are inevitable. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=540.2s)]
*  And any inaccuracy against the machine, even if you made already 45 good moves and four great moves, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=550.72s)]
*  but the fifth is move that is simply inaccurate, may deny you victory that you think you deserve by playing brilliantly. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=558.24s)]
*  You don't have to lose necessarily, but if your position is really good. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=567.24s)]
*  But machine, let me just emphasize, playing against a machine requires precision and concentration [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=571.04s)]
*  that I don't think it can be achieved by humans in a regular game of chess or another game like Goal or Shogi. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=582.12s)]
*  I think if we want to continue this experiment or just to put it in extreme form, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=593.12s)]
*  I would say that if we have Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion, offered an opportunity to play against a computer, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=605.52s)]
*  say, 10 games match, on the conditions that he wins the match if he was one game. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=616.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=622.52s)]
*  Which means he can play all the games without thinking about losing the game by making a mistake, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=623.52s)]
*  or just he can play without this terrible psychological pressure. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=630.6s)]
*  Maybe there's still a chance. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=635.6s)]
*  I would bet on the computer though, would you? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=636.76s)]
*  I know, but he has to win only one game. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=638.9200000000001s)]
*  I know, but to win a game against Ribca is very difficult. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=640.84s)]
*  If it were draw one game, I might bet on Magnus. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=645.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=646.64s)]
*  Draw I take no. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=647.52s)]
*  If you're talking about drawing, then, you know, and Magnus plays white, for instance, let's take Magnus. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=648.52s)]
*  I think it's still 50-50 chance. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=657.96s)]
*  Magnus is pretty good. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=660.8s)]
*  So just drawing with. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=661.88s)]
*  No, I'm talking about winning. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=663.56s)]
*  So this is not drawing, you'll make few draws. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=665.16s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=667.24s)]
*  I have no doubt about it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=667.84s)]
*  Now winning, if you give him this big handicap that he doesn't have to think about losing the games, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=668.92s)]
*  it's all about concentrating and looking for the best moves. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=675.4s)]
*  I think there's a chance. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't bet my bottom dollar. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  I still think it's below 50 percent. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=681.16s)]
*  But there's a chance. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=683.32s)]
*  There's a decent chance. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=684.16s)]
*  It's not slim to none that the best player may win. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=685.4s)]
*  But again, we're talking about handicap event. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=689.64s)]
*  So I think that's the matches I played with Deep Blue and following matches that I played with Deep Junior and Deep Ritz [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=694.36s)]
*  and the matches that Kramnik played with Deep Ritz. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=708.24s)]
*  They ended the story of human machine competition on equal terms. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=711.32s)]
*  But they closed this chapter of the search of the mysteries of human intelligence in the realm of chess. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=717.36s)]
*  Now, a lot of humans don't play chess, but we're looking at a future where AI will make decisions about who gets a monetary loan, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  who is diagnosed as being schizophrenic or bipolar, how cars drive on the road increasingly is controlled by software. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=740.0s)]
*  The fact that the decisions of the software are not so transparent, and you see this also in computer chess, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  how will ordinary human beings respond to the fact that more and more of their lives will be, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=754.72s)]
*  quote unquote, controlled by these non-transparent processes that are too smart for them to understand? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=758.96s)]
*  Because in your book, you have emotional conflict with Deep Blue, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=767.76s)]
*  Exactly. And I'm just telling you that it's inevitable. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  There are certain things that are happening and it's called progress. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=775.0400000000001s)]
*  This is the history of human civilization. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=778.84s)]
*  I think the whole history is a process or a steady process of replacing all forms of labor by machines. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=781.72s)]
*  It started with machines replacing farm animals and then manual laborers. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=791.64s)]
*  And then it kept growing and growing and growing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=798.16s)]
*  There was a time I mentioned in the book, people didn't trust elevators without operators. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=801.44s)]
*  They thought it would be too dangerous. It took a major strike. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=808.96s)]
*  And in the city of New York, that was equal, a major disaster. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=812.6s)]
*  If you had to climb to the Empire State Building with paralyzed elevators. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=817.96s)]
*  I understand that today people are concerned about self-driving cars. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=825.64s)]
*  Absolutely. Right. When do they swerve? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=830.24s)]
*  But imagine there was a time, I'm sure people were really concerned. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  They were scared, Steve, of autopilots. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=836.44s)]
*  Now, I think, you know, if you tell them that autopilots don't work in the plane, they will not fly. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=841.1600000000001s)]
*  Because they understand that, again, in big numbers, these decisions are still more... [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=846.1999999999999s)]
*  ...more qualitative. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=857.68s)]
*  And while I understand that also the fear of people who might be losing jobs and they could see that machines are threatening their traditional livelihood. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=860.6s)]
*  But at the same time, even these people whose jobs are on chopping block of automation, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=872.36s)]
*  they also depend on the new wave of technology to generate economic growth and to create sustainable new jobs. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=878.36s)]
*  This is a cycle. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  And the only difference with what we have been seeing throughout human history is that now machines are coming after people with college degree, political influence and Twitter accounts. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=889.44s)]
*  But say I'm at the self-checkout in the supermarket, if something doesn't work, I sometimes get fairly frustrated. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=901.68s)]
*  If I'm with a human cashier, maybe a new person, they're just training and they don't do it properly, I don't get frustrated at all. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=907.72s)]
*  I'm very tolerant because it's a human. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=913.76s)]
*  But the machine is much harder for me, just like it can be harder to play against Deep Blue than another human. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=915.68s)]
*  So are we doomed to a future where maybe things work more effectively, but we're just frustrated all the time because there's not the human to human interaction to ease? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  Again, it's hard for us to imagine, but we have been moving in this direction for a long time. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=929.92s)]
*  So many things are just being done by machines already. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=936.4799999999999s)]
*  So that now machines will be more actively engaged in human interaction. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=939.64s)]
*  I can hardly imagine the supermarket with no humans at all. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=945.8399999999999s)]
*  There will be other humans who will be supervising machines. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=949.88s)]
*  And I think that's... [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=953.16s)]
*  But you could run a supermarket with no humans. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=954.8s)]
*  I think there are two of them in Japan. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=956.76s)]
*  But I still think at the end of the day, you need some humans in a different kind of job because you understand exactly what you said. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=959.0s)]
*  Frustration and certain accidents. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=966.36s)]
*  At the end of the day, you're on the supermarket to make profit. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=968.8s)]
*  You don't want your customers to run away if they're unhappy. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=971.24s)]
*  So you will need maybe some human machine psychologists to make sure that the customer's satisfaction will be up to a certain level. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  But again, let's look at this historical process. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=987.36s)]
*  So machines that replace manual labor, they have allowed us to focus on developing our minds. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=991.64s)]
*  Now, more intelligent machines. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  More intelligent machines. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1006.68s)]
*  They... [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1009.12s)]
*  I understand that they can... [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1011.12s)]
*  They will take over more menial aspects of cognition and will elevate our lives towards curiosity, creativity, beauty, joy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1014.5999999999999s)]
*  You can continue this line. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1026.48s)]
*  We just have to understand that everything that we know how to do, machines will eventually do better. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1032.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1038.6s)]
*  Let's say there's a mortgage lending algorithm and someone charges that it's discriminatory. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1039.9599999999998s)]
*  It lends too often, say, to white people and not enough to black people. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1044.6s)]
*  And there's some kind of trial or regulatory inquiry. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1048.48s)]
*  And the first thing everyone realizes is that no human can even understand the algorithm, much less judge it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1051.12s)]
*  What happens then legally? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1056.7199999999998s)]
*  Or is it simply the case that so many new chains of cause and effect are so non-transparent to us we don't even know what to do? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1058.1999999999998s)]
*  My answer is I don't know. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  But that's exactly why we should not worry about the future, because the problem is the future if we know what's going to happen. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1070.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1079.1999999999998s)]
*  That's always not good. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1079.6399999999999s)]
*  We all know that means that in the situation that you described, we'll need new kind of lawyers. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1081.56s)]
*  We'll need new kind of experts that will be able to solve these problems. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1087.84s)]
*  There will be redistribution of jobs. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1094.04s)]
*  Many jobs today, like drone operators or 3D printer managers or social media managers, they didn't exist 10 years ago, 15 years ago. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1097.56s)]
*  No doubt that in 10, 15 years, there will be many jobs, maybe the best paid jobs that don't exist today. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1108.12s)]
*  And we don't even know how these jobs will look like. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1113.84s)]
*  And I think that's natural. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1116.92s)]
*  All we have to do is to just to realize that this process is inevitable. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1120.72s)]
*  And we have to prepare us mentally, but also to have some sort of safety cushions to help people that will have great difficulty in adjusting. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1125.2s)]
*  People that come from manufacturing jobs, manufacturing sector, people that are older and don't have the same knowledge of machines. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1140.2s)]
*  And how to make sure the society will not be shaken badly by another dramatic shift in technology. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1153.2s)]
*  But say more and more jobs are redistributed toward AI. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  It can be very daunting to work with artificial intelligence. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1167.88s)]
*  So with Deep Blue, they had Joel Benjamin, who, as you know, is a very smart guy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1171.0s)]
*  Is our educational system up to the shift? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1175.44s)]
*  And won't it just mean the return to skilled labor just keeps on rising and income distribution becomes less and less equal? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1178.36s)]
*  Or do you think somehow we will adapt? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1185.84s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1190.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like 38. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1191.4399999999998s)]
*  No, you mentioned the word education. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1193.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1194.76s)]
*  That's what we should concentrate because I think it's quite obvious today that the educational system that is still dominating this area. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1195.1599999999999s)]
*  Of knowledge. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1209.2s)]
*  It's inadequate. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1210.96s)]
*  When you look at a classroom, it hasn't changed since the University of Bologna in certain 14th century. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1213.56s)]
*  So we still have the same school infrastructure or college infrastructure that normally has. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1220.56s)]
*  It's like a one way street. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1229.88s)]
*  The information always comes from the teacher to the class. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1231.08s)]
*  While this new generation is operating in two ways, it's always interactive exchange. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1234.56s)]
*  And the biggest problem, and I've been talking about for quite a while, that we're still teaching very specific knowledge in the schools. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1242.44s)]
*  And instead of teaching what we have to teach how, because this knowledge may be redundant 10 years from now. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1252.76s)]
*  We are preparing kids for the world that will change dramatically. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1262.12s)]
*  By the way, we already know it will look different. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1266.0s)]
*  So what's the point of trying to teach kids at age 10, 11, 12, without recognizing the fact that when they finish college, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1268.56s)]
*  when they will become adults looking for jobs, the job market will be totally different. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1281.28s)]
*  And most don't even finish college, right? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1288.72s)]
*  Maybe they won't finish college, but now we have to start thinking already, not even thinking, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1291.12s)]
*  but even implementing new techniques to teach them how to teach them certain basics, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1296.44s)]
*  certain skills that will be required in the world that we all know will be quite different. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1300.92s)]
*  And the new jobs will require definitely knowledge of computers and certain traditional skills [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1309.56s)]
*  that have been on demand for generations simply will vanish. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1317.92s)]
*  But won't AI just adjust much more quickly? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1327.52s)]
*  So AI progress in chess exceeded your expectations, the expectations of David Levy, many other people. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1330.08s)]
*  It seems our system of education at K through 12, the high school graduation rate has been almost stuck since the late 1960s. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1336.8799999999999s)]
*  College graduation rate, you know, maybe is approaching 40 percent. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1344.0s)]
*  It could take 30, 40 years to turn that around, even if we started doing everything right now. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  So are in a sense some people still left in the dust by these differential rates of change? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1352.96s)]
*  I mean, should we be so optimistic? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1357.92s)]
*  Yes and no. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1362.3200000000002s)]
*  No, we tend to forget that every dramatic change in human history caused also major problems. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1363.04s)]
*  Whether we like it or not, but the most dramatic technological advance [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1377.44s)]
*  happened at a time of war where people thought only about winning and having the best [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1384.0s)]
*  and they didn't think about sacrifices or about comfort. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1389.44s)]
*  I hope we can avoid the repetition of this cycle. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1396.8s)]
*  But naturally we can expect substantial problems for many people who will have difficulty of adjusting to new realities. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1402.56s)]
*  So what we can do, just let's be objective, let's talk about it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1414.3200000000002s)]
*  And let's not terrorize them by the images of the Hollywood movies like The Terminator or The Matrix. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1418.72s)]
*  It's a challenge that is ahead of us, but it's not the end of the world. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1428.48s)]
*  There will be downsides, but there will be upsides. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1434.24s)]
*  And let's see how we can manage our move into the future. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1437.52s)]
*  Because what is the alternative? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1448.3200000000002s)]
*  We don't get to choose when and where technological progress stops. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1452.96s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1457.3600000000001s)]
*  So what I believe is the right approach is to understand that while machines can do eventually [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1458.72s)]
*  better everything that we know how to do, but there's still so many new things that only we can reveal. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1465.92s)]
*  I'm always calling for us looking for new frontiers. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1474.24s)]
*  There's no need to slow down. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  We just have to speed up. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1488.16s)]
*  And there's so many new challenges. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1489.76s)]
*  It's up in the space, down in the oceans, so many things that we're not doing now because they're too risky. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1492.4s)]
*  And we like our comfortable life. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1499.92s)]
*  Now, I guess artificial intelligence, though I'm not as optimistic about the development, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's going to happen overnight, it's happening, but it's not a speed that is [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1509.04s)]
*  threatening us as predicted by the doomsayers. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1516.16s)]
*  But that will give us a push towards more risky adventures and forcing us to take the tasks that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1524.24s)]
*  now we are rejecting because they are offering question of returns with obvious risks. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1534.16s)]
*  You've been a pioneer in what's sometimes called advanced chess, freestyle chess, or centaur chess, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1539.44s)]
*  where you pair a human being with a computer or a set of programs. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1544.96s)]
*  Today, 2017, do you still think it's the case that a human paired with a set of programs is better [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1549.04s)]
*  than playing against just the single strongest computer program in chess? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1556.48s)]
*  Oh, there's no doubt about it. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1560.48s)]
*  But the human will make some mistakes, so the human will ask Stockfish, Komodo, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1563.6000000000001s)]
*  Ribca, what's the best move, collate the different outputs, make some kind of judgment, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1567.6000000000001s)]
*  explore some lines more deeply, put that against Ribca Cluster. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1571.6s)]
*  Is Ribca Cluster really going to lose many games? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1575.84s)]
*  I think so. Again, it depends on the qualification of the operator. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1578.6399999999999s)]
*  Sure, but the best operator in the world, whoever that may be, maybe yourself, maybe Anson Williams. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1583.04s)]
*  By the way, I exclude myself from this category because I'm not a very good operator, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1589.28s)]
*  I'm a very good chess player, but a great operator does not have to be necessarily a very strong player. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1592.8799999999999s)]
*  What makes for a great operator? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1601.36s)]
*  Someone who can work out the most effective combination bringing together human and machine [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  skills. I reach a formulation that a weak human player plus machine plus a better process is [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1614.9599999999998s)]
*  superior not only to a very powerful machine, but most remarkably to a strong human player [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1625.92s)]
*  plus machine plus an inferior process. At the end of the day, it's about interface. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1632.0s)]
*  Creating an interface that will help us to coach machine towards more useful intelligence [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1639.68s)]
*  will be the right step forward. I'm a great believer that if we put together [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1647.9199999999998s)]
*  a good operator, still it's a decent chess player, not necessarily a very strong chess player. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  Running two, three machines and finding the best way to get this knowledge, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1663.9199999999998s)]
*  to translate this knowledge into the quality moves against Rupke cluster, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1671.28s)]
*  I would probably bet on a human plus machine. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1679.04s)]
*  A few questions about another one of your interests, Russia, formerly the Soviet Union. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1682.32s)]
*  If we look back on centuries of Russian history, do you think there's something in Russian geography [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1687.36s)]
*  or demographics or geopolitics? What has it been that has led to such [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1694.64s)]
*  unfree outcomes fairly systematically? Where do you find the roots of tyranny in the history of Russia? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1699.52s)]
*  Is it like a mix of the size of the country, its openness to invasion, its vulnerability, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1708.16s)]
*  something about being next to a dynamic Europe on the other side, China? What is it? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1712.4s)]
*  Look, it's a long, if not endless theoretical debate based on our interpretation of [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1717.92s)]
*  certain historical events. I'm not convinced with this arguments about [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1728.72s)]
*  some nations being predetermined in their development and [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  ailing to the concept of democracy and the rule of law. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1744.08s)]
*  The reason I'm quite comfortable with this denial is that we can move from theory to practice. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1749.92s)]
*  While we can talk about history and certain influence of historical events to modernity, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1760.16s)]
*  we can look at the places like Korea, Korean Peninsula. The same nation, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1772.4s)]
*  not even cousins, but brothers and sisters, divided in 1950. That's by historical standards [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1778.48s)]
*  yesterday. We could see the difference. One country is the demonstration of the worst [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1786.64s)]
*  orals nightmare. It's a gulag run by a paranoid dictator, the family of dictators, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1798.24s)]
*  those three generations. On the other side, the very same nation built one of the most sophisticated [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1808.88s)]
*  market economies and a very resilient democracy that people in Europe can envy. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1815.76s)]
*  Just recently, they had a president impeached and tried, and the CEO of the biggest corporation [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1824.6399999999999s)]
*  also being charged with crimes. The two most important people in the country, right? [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1831.36s)]
*  Exactly. The same nation. Then obviously, we can talk about to Germany, but I would rather look [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1837.36s)]
*  now to China and Taiwan. Again, the same people, and we could see the difference. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1848.56s)]
*  Obviously, China is growing, but comparing to dynamism and political stability of Taiwan, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1855.44s)]
*  it's a small rocky island with 20-plus million people versus 1.1 billion Chinese in continental [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1868.3999999999999s)]
*  China. We could see that Taiwan is far more advanced, more dynamic, and the separation [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1877.92s)]
*  happened at the same time. Now, we can even look, as you just mentioned, it's Asia and Europe. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1887.76s)]
*  We can even look at former Soviet Union and try to analyze from our knowledge of 2017 [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1896.16s)]
*  what's happened after collapse of the Soviet Union and why certain [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1906.32s)]
*  some nations that are close to each other now move in opposite directions. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1914.24s)]
*  Let's look at Russia and Ukraine. Let's look not at the whole Ukraine, but just at Eastern Ukraine. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1918.4s)]
*  Eastern Ukraine is populated mostly by ethnic Russians. In the former Soviet Union, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1925.52s)]
*  the borders between republics, they were very nominal. People could move around. It was not a [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1935.12s)]
*  big deal. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the official state border between Russia [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1941.4399999999998s)]
*  and Ukraine was respected, but people still could move around and they didn't need a special visa. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1947.6s)]
*  When we look at ethnic Russians born and raised in Kursk and Belgrade on the Russian side, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1956.0s)]
*  across the border, say in Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk on the Ukrainian side, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1962.64s)]
*  there were people that could hardly be separated from anything. They read the same newspaper [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1968.5600000000002s)]
*  Pravda, watched the same television, spoke the very same language, not even accents. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1976.5600000000002s)]
*  But somehow in 2014, after Putin's annexation of Crimea and invasion of Eastern Ukraine, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1983.2s)]
*  we saw a huge difference. Most of ethnic Russians in Ukraine signed for Ukrainian army, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1990.72s)]
*  fighting against Putin's invasion against the same Russians that came from other side. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=1998.0800000000002s)]
*  Again, it could be a long debate, but I would say that one of the main reasons is that Ukraine [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2005.76s)]
*  that Ukraine experienced in 1994 a gradual transition of power from one president to another [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2011.28s)]
*  after sitting president Leonid Kravchuk lost elections and walked away. So Ukrainians [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2018.96s)]
*  somehow got an idea that power is not sacred and the government can come and go and they can [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2027.68s)]
*  remove it by voting. And even despite the fact that Ukraine never experienced higher living [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2034.6399999999999s)]
*  standards than Russia, people realized that keeping this freedom, keeping this ability to [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2040.48s)]
*  influence their bureaucrats and government through peaceful process of voting and, if necessary, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2049.44s)]
*  striking far more effective than Russia's quote, stability where the same leader could be in charge [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2058.8s)]
*  of the country with his corrupt clique for a long, long time. How vulnerable is Putin right now and [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2068.0s)]
*  to the extent he is, is there a path toward democracy at the end of that process? I don't [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2074.32s)]
*  know whether there's a path to democracy. So what I know is that it's the regimes like Putin's that [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2079.68s)]
*  are most aggressive and most dangerous because it's not even Soviet Union or modern China where [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2085.12s)]
*  you had, as in the USSR or we have today as in China, a Politburo, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2093.36s)]
*  Central Committee of the Communist Party. So a group of people, very powerful people calling [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2100.32s)]
*  all the shots. Putin's Russia is a one-man dictatorship and dictator doesn't care about [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2104.96s)]
*  the future of the country or about transition of power. There's nothing of interest for him [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2113.36s)]
*  if he's gone because normally it's not the retirement. He loses power, he loses everything, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2119.68s)]
*  including very often his own life. So he will be desperate in protecting this power and throwing [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2125.3599999999997s)]
*  all resources at his disposal to stay on the top. So that's why he is less sensitive [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2133.8399999999997s)]
*  for new wars and new very aggressive moves, international moves, because his power is not [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2143.3599999999997s)]
*  limited. Every group of people, even the worst of people, the Mafia families, they always come to [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2151.68s)]
*  more balanced decisions because there's always a search for some kind of compromise. As in Iran, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2159.12s)]
*  yes. Exactly. They have to look for compromise because they know that they have to be [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2164.8799999999997s)]
*  all part of the same system and if the system goes down, they all could lose everything. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2173.2s)]
*  Putin doesn't have to listen to it. Okay, he may listen, but he doesn't have to listen to [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2178.08s)]
*  these advices and his power is limited by other elite groups. All he has to do, and [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2185.04s)]
*  he proved to be a very capable dictator, to make sure that these groups are fighting each other [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2196.9599999999996s)]
*  and he could be kind of a judge on top of that. I always call it the spine of the system, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2202.08s)]
*  which means that if he goes down, you don't expect just a simple transition of power. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2209.36s)]
*  Will it be a democracy? The answer is no. It's not going to be democratic next day, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2216.3199999999997s)]
*  but I'm strongly resisting the idea, popular idea in Russia and now in the free world as well, that [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2220.64s)]
*  Putin's collapse could lead to something even worse. They say open fascist dictatorship, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2231.68s)]
*  as if today in Russia we don't have a fascist dictatorship. No one or no other group that will [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2240.0s)]
*  replace Putin in power will have the same ability to cause damage inside the country and outside [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2248.16s)]
*  most likely these groups will try to communicate with the West, to find some kind of understanding [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2255.6s)]
*  and to reduce the tension. So while I don't expect an immediate democratic [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2263.28s)]
*  reconstruction in Russia after Putin's collapse, I think that Putin's fall, Putin's demise, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2271.92s)]
*  will serve Russia well and also will help to reduce the pressure with our neighbors. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2278.96s)]
*  What if the provisional government of Kerensky had made peace with the Germans in World War I [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2288.4s)]
*  before Lenin re-enters the country? Could you imagine a path for Russia where [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2293.44s)]
*  today would be more or less like a normal European country? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2298.32s)]
*  I think that if we try to make some projections into the future, you can hardly imagine Russia [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2302.48s)]
*  surviving as a state in its current borders, though I'm not sure it's feasible at all [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2308.24s)]
*  with all the pressure from China and radical Islam from the East and from the South. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2314.64s)]
*  But for Russia to find its spot in the family of civilized nations in the 21st century, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2319.2s)]
*  it has no other choice but to work with Europe and the United States. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2324.3999999999996s)]
*  Also, going back to this Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and now open war in eastern Ukraine, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2327.8399999999997s)]
*  we can revisit early days of Russian history, going back nearly a thousand years, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2339.44s)]
*  and to remind people that there was another Russia. Actually, the cradle of Russian civilization [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2348.8799999999997s)]
*  was Kiev's Russia and the trade republics in the northwest of Russia, like Novgorod and Tomskoye, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2354.88s)]
*  that were those entities were fully integrated into the European political and trade space. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2361.12s)]
*  Maybe what is happening now in Ukraine and what will happen eventually in Russia, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2375.36s)]
*  it will be the final showdown between Kiev's Russia and the pro-European Russia and the [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2380.0s)]
*  dominant tradition that was inherited by Moscow from the Golden Horde and the Byzantine Empire, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2386.08s)]
*  and Russia will reinvent itself and will go back to its original roots. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2393.36s)]
*  We have a segment in all of these podcasts called Underrated or Overrated, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2400.64s)]
*  and I name something and you give me your sense of how important it is to you, or if it's underrated [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2404.56s)]
*  or overrated, and I'll start with the Bulgakov novel Master and Margarita, overrated or underrated. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2408.72s)]
*  It's hard to say because it was my favorite book. It's still my favorite. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2415.68s)]
*  Then it's underrated, right? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2420.08s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2422.3199999999997s)]
*  Why is the novel important to you? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2422.8799999999997s)]
*  It's hard to explain for people who did not grow up in the Soviet Union because there are so many [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2428.08s)]
*  unique aspects that were close to the hearts of people who experienced communism and the life [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2433.92s)]
*  under these draconian laws, but it's a unique combination of reasoning history and going back [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2441.92s)]
*  to the days of Jesus and telling us in a very original form the classical [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2450.0s)]
*  biblical story and projecting it to the life in Moscow in the 30s. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2457.44s)]
*  And for those of us who read it in the 70s and 80s, we still could actually feel that it was [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  because it was about human nature. It reminded us that human nature doesn't change. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2470.32s)]
*  With all the progress, people still have the same vulnerabilities, the same weaknesses, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2476.88s)]
*  the same temptations. And this connection of times from the ancient days to modern days, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2482.16s)]
*  for me, it still stands. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2494.32s)]
*  What from American fiction has almost the same power for you? Falkner, Melville, Mark Twain? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2497.52s)]
*  You've become an American in some ways. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2505.92s)]
*  Talk about the human nature, all kingsmen. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2508.16s)]
*  Ides of March, Thorndenwalder. Again, I'm always looking for the books that are about something [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2520.48s)]
*  else, about days that were in a distant past. But again, there's something that is so [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2529.76s)]
*  close because we're humans and certain images from these books we could see in today's political arena. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2538.7200000000003s)]
*  The films of Andrei Tarkovsky, overrated or underrated? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2546.88s)]
*  Stalker, yes. It's a mixture. And I also don't like when it's the films. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2550.4s)]
*  Overall, I'm not the biggest fan. So I picked up one or two movies, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2567.92s)]
*  but as I mentioned, Stalker. But otherwise, I'm not the greatest fan. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2576.3999999999996s)]
*  The chess opening, The King's Gambit, 2F4, underrated or overrated? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2582.64s)]
*  It's a great piece of history, but it has no relevance today. So that's why, again, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2588.48s)]
*  it doesn't pass my test of connecting the past and the present and the future. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2596.3199999999997s)]
*  There are certain things that stay in the past because there were great moments in the game of [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2602.8799999999997s)]
*  chess. These gambits helped to create beautiful games that we can still enjoy. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2609.12s)]
*  But Spassky beat Fischer with it once. That was a long time ago. You don't think that could happen? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2617.7599999999998s)]
*  Having taught the lost position after move 15. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2623.04s)]
*  With databases you think no way ever again. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2625.8399999999997s)]
*  No, but I looked at these openings and I just came to the conclusion that [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2629.52s)]
*  they simply don't stand modern technique of defense and counterattack. They're not [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2636.4s)]
*  feasible. If you are looking for a good game, a professional game, they're not feasible. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2644.5600000000004s)]
*  By the way, I was the one who reinvented and brought back the Scotch, the Evans Gambit. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2649.36s)]
*  I just have to realize that, okay, I don't play anymore, but the way that the chess has developed [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2655.8399999999997s)]
*  made most of these openings, not all of them, but mainly gambits, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2662.0s)]
*  simply not feasible weapons at the top level. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2666.24s)]
*  If you took a top 10 player from the 70s, someone like Timon or Ulf Andersen, a very good player. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2670.0s)]
*  Are you sure Timon is top player of the 70s? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2675.68s)]
*  No, top 10 player at times. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2677.68s)]
*  I don't think he was top 10. In the 70s? Okay, it's as he was. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2679.2799999999997s)]
*  Someone who was in the candidate matches. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2683.68s)]
*  And you give them a 2017 openings database that they can use and no one else ever has access to. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2686.56s)]
*  How much stronger a player do they become? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  It could be quite a significant progress. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2697.2s)]
*  100 rating points, 200 rating points? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2699.36s)]
*  I don't know, but [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2701.36s)]
*  it will definitely add probably 100 rating points. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2702.3999999999996s)]
*  The reason I'm thinking about your question, and I have some difficulty answering this question, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2715.4399999999996s)]
*  is that for how long will it stay secret? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2721.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2725.44s)]
*  The moment people see new ideas, they will start moving into this territory. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2728.4s)]
*  You can hardly imagine that you can sit on this database for too long and others just [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2734.08s)]
*  falling victims of your deep knowledge. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2742.32s)]
*  But it will be quite a significant improvement. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2746.7200000000003s)]
*  In the match, if you're talking about the database given to a world championship, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2749.84s)]
*  one of the participants of the match, say Kostya Karpov, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2758.16s)]
*  that could be the size of factor. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2764.4s)]
*  Tolstoy, overrated or underrated? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2765.6s)]
*  You can answer whoever you want. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2768.0800000000004s)]
*  Again, very uneven. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2781.36s)]
*  So certain novels are just phenomenal. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2784.6400000000003s)]
*  The short fiction, right? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2790.8s)]
*  Haji Murad is phenomenal. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2792.1600000000003s)]
*  Many of them are phenomenal. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  The problem is that sometimes there's so much philosophy in a war on peace [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2795.44s)]
*  that it's outdated. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2801.44s)]
*  Dostoyevsky is underrated because it's all about human nature. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2808.4s)]
*  That doesn't matter whether you live in Russia in the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2812.64s)]
*  second quarter of the 19th century or in the first quarter of the 21st century. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2817.2s)]
*  The human emotions, the human temptations, the human reactions, they are still very much the same. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2829.52s)]
*  Back to chess. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2837.2799999999997s)]
*  We both know Ken Rogoff, highly successful as an economist and a very good chess player. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2838.16s)]
*  If we take most top chess players at the very top and somehow they could not have played chess, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2843.2s)]
*  in other endeavors, how successful do you think they would have been? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2848.4s)]
*  No idea. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2851.92s)]
*  How specialized is talent? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2856.0s)]
*  But you talk to the very general audience. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2857.44s)]
*  When you say very good chess player, you have to explain... [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2860.48s)]
*  Top five. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2862.3199999999997s)]
*  Ken Rogoff. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2864.96s)]
*  Not top five. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2866.7999999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, but he was a very strong grandmas. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2867.52s)]
*  This is the man who played professional chess. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2870.56s)]
*  The moment you say very good chess player, some people think, oh, maybe a good club player. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2873.12s)]
*  Very good by your standards. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2876.88s)]
*  No, no, no, he was very good. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2878.4s)]
*  He was very good by any standards. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2879.84s)]
*  So that's there. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2881.2s)]
*  And that makes me unique. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2882.32s)]
*  So whether he was top 100 or not, but somewhere there in the world at his peak in mid-70s. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2883.52s)]
*  I don't think that the aptitude of playing chess is anything but aptitude for playing chess. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2892.48s)]
*  There's no universal rule. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2898.48s)]
*  Some people could move to other areas. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2900.4s)]
*  I was very, very lucky that I grew up with my mother who helped me to get education outside of chess. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2902.32s)]
*  And I always had various interests and looked for life in its entirety. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2916.32s)]
*  And that's why after I stopped playing professionally in 2005, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2925.6000000000004s)]
*  then already it was the help of my wife so I could move from chess to other areas. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2930.64s)]
*  And now I have a very full life. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2935.6s)]
*  Without playing chess professionally. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2938.24s)]
*  But again, that's not the rule. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2940.16s)]
*  That's not happening with other players. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2942.3199999999997s)]
*  Though some of them, I'm sure, could do extremely well. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2945.7599999999998s)]
*  By the way, some of them were very good business people. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2949.6s)]
*  Some of them made good investments. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2951.7599999999998s)]
*  If you look at some of the British grandmasters or other players in Europe, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2953.8399999999997s)]
*  there's no rule. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2960.72s)]
*  But I think that chess helps some of them to find the right approach to their new endeavor. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2962.7999999999997s)]
*  It may not be specific. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2977.44s)]
*  For instance, I'm more of humanitarian. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2978.56s)]
*  So I prefer history, literature. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2981.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess I'm a good speaker. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2984.96s)]
*  But I'm not as good in number crunching. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2986.48s)]
*  It's very important to understand what you're good at. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2989.84s)]
*  That's what chess helps you. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2992.2400000000002s)]
*  So to recognize what is your strength and also to be very open about your own weaknesses. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=2993.68s)]
*  Perhaps you may recall your 1999 game against Topalov, right? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3000.96s)]
*  So a key moment in that game, you play rook takes d4. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3005.44s)]
*  Now when you played rook takes d4 and made that sacrifice, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3009.76s)]
*  did you see at the time the later brilliant moves coming up? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3013.36s)]
*  Your c3, your bishop f1, your rook d7? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3017.44s)]
*  Or did you just feel there's going to be something that comes up? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3020.0800000000004s)]
*  How much was it? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3022.6400000000003s)]
*  One or the other? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3023.28s)]
*  Not sure exactly at what point I saw the final combination. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3024.32s)]
*  But first of all, after playing rook takes d4, I knew if he would have taken the rook, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3027.84s)]
*  which was a mistake. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3035.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3035.92s)]
*  He should have played king b6. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3036.2400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3037.6000000000004s)]
*  But he got very good position. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3038.0800000000004s)]
*  But I knew that it would be already good for me. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3040.5600000000004s)]
*  Though I was not sure about the outcome immediately. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3044.24s)]
*  But within move or two, actually, I saw the whole line. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3049.28s)]
*  And I was quite lucky. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3052.8s)]
*  But at the same time, it prevented me from finding the forced win in the middle of the combination. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3056.72s)]
*  Because at one point I made a second rate move. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3061.44s)]
*  Just because I already saw the whole line. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3066.56s)]
*  And it was so aesthetically pleasing. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3068.48s)]
*  It was so easily. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3069.68s)]
*  And I just looked for obvious moves for black. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3070.8s)]
*  By the way, both me and Trapalov missed a much better defense for black that could prevent [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3074.5600000000004s)]
*  it, this combination. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3078.8s)]
*  Though, of course, the end game. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3080.7200000000003s)]
*  You mean 30, rook h to e8? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3082.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3083.84s)]
*  Does black hold with that? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3084.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3085.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3085.6800000000003s)]
*  I think the end game was still, it's much better for white, though it's not winning. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3086.2400000000002s)]
*  So the move pointed by Kavaleck, rook a7 immediately, would be winning by force. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3091.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3099.6000000000004s)]
*  So it would be made. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3099.84s)]
*  A mating net that black couldn't escape from where black king couldn't escape. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  But because I saw this, it's all the way up to the rook d7. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3108.88s)]
*  So I just, and you look at the time I spent, I played almost blitz because I was so anxious [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3112.2400000000002s)]
*  to reach the position and to demonstrate how far I could see it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3123.04s)]
*  And also I was amazed by the beauty of this geometry. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3127.04s)]
*  So I didn't prepare you for this question. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3131.6s)]
*  You simply remember, correct? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3133.36s)]
*  The game against Trapalov. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3136.72s)]
*  Well, at least I don't know. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  Look. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3138.56s)]
*  I didn't come to you before this session and tell you to go back and look at the game. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3138.8s)]
*  You simply remember. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3142.24s)]
*  I have to confess that I don't remember the exact number of the moves. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3142.8s)]
*  I can't reconstruct the game. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3147.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3148.48s)]
*  I can't reconstruct the game. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3149.12s)]
*  But when he said rook h8, I was actually to figure out. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3150.08s)]
*  That's when he played queen c4. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3153.2s)]
*  No, and of course, exactly. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3154.48s)]
*  Then it would end up with the end game when I would be changed down. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3155.8399999999997s)]
*  But I had rook and bishop and several pawns for his two rooks. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3160.56s)]
*  And if I remember correctly, it's probably it's winning, but it's not forced. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3165.12s)]
*  Would a top chess engine have played rook takes d4 today? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3172.72s)]
*  I didn't check. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3178.3999999999996s)]
*  It depends on the relation of king b6 because they will see immediately, even without calculating [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3179.8399999999997s)]
*  the whole combination, they will see immediately that white could force a draw. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3185.3599999999997s)]
*  I thought, by the way, that's what Trapalov thought, that I wanted to make a draw. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3189.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3192.3199999999997s)]
*  White could force a draw while after king b6, every engine shows immediately that black is better. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3192.72s)]
*  I mean, slightly better, but the evaluation is clearly in black's favor. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3198.08s)]
*  So that's why they wouldn't take the rook. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3201.92s)]
*  Now, I don't remember whether rook takes. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3203.6s)]
*  I don't remember whether rook takes. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3206.4s)]
*  I think at that time, white had no choice but to take on d4 because otherwise, you know, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3208.4s)]
*  the whole position. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3212.8s)]
*  Then black has much more space. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3213.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3214.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3214.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3215.04s)]
*  Now, given this, does this mean even very, very good chess engines will never play games [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3215.92s)]
*  as beautiful as human beings? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3220.64s)]
*  Because you were so excited by this combination. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3222.7200000000003s)]
*  In some ways, it may have led you down inexact paths, but it nonetheless led you down those [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3224.96s)]
*  paths and we got the beautiful game that we did. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3229.04s)]
*  But now, you move back to these chess computers and there's certain things that people should [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3231.92s)]
*  realize because I hate talking about these things. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3239.6000000000004s)]
*  We're saying Russia is using a bird language because you're asking me questions and I'm [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3244.96s)]
*  not sure that 99% of our listeners, they understand exactly what we're talking about. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3249.2000000000003s)]
*  Now, there's one thing for people to understand is that chess is, you may call, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3254.08s)]
*  mathematically infinite game. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3259.44s)]
*  So the number of legal moves is more than the number of atoms in the solar system. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3260.7200000000003s)]
*  So machines cannot solve the game. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3268.88s)]
*  You cannot expect machine to play e2, e4 at move one and announcing made in 16,455 moves. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3271.36s)]
*  But machines could work the game of chess from the end. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3278.56s)]
*  So now we know that machines solved, mathematically solved. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3283.7599999999998s)]
*  All positions was four pieces, like king and queen versus king and rook. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3289.2s)]
*  All positions was five pieces. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3294.56s)]
*  All positions was six pieces. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3296.7999999999997s)]
*  And now, seven pieces. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3298.8799999999997s)]
*  Seven pieces, it's on the way. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3301.52s)]
*  I'm not sure it's all solved, but we're talking about 100 terabytes. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3305.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, obviously eight pieces will be already just insane number and the game of chess is [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3314.64s)]
*  ultimate end game with 32 pieces. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  So that's why maybe machines will get to eight or nine moves, but that's what we'll prove [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3324.7999999999997s)]
*  at the end, even for the immense computing power that you can expect in next five, 10, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3329.12s)]
*  20 years. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3334.3999999999996s)]
*  Will AI write beautiful music? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3335.04s)]
*  Or is there something about... [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3336.8799999999997s)]
*  But I want to finish this because what we discovered in this process, I mean, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3338.08s)]
*  I wouldn't overweight our listeners with all these details. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3344.0s)]
*  I don't want just to throw on them the mass information. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3353.2799999999997s)]
*  It's amazing what people will enjoy. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3358.7999999999997s)]
*  They'll be surprised. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3360.3199999999997s)]
*  But in some of these positions, like there are certain seven pieces positions. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3361.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3369.12s)]
*  When the win and we're talking about the forced win can reach within 500 moves. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3371.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3378.24s)]
*  Now, 500 moves. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3378.72s)]
*  I remember I looked at some of the positions, even at six pieces position. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3380.88s)]
*  It's not intelligible. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3384.24s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3385.12s)]
*  What's happening, right? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3385.68s)]
*  There's no intelligence at all. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3386.16s)]
*  It's just pieces moving around. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3388.16s)]
*  I saw the position with king, two rooks, a knight on one side and king, two rooks on [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3390.4s)]
*  other side. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3396.4s)]
*  And it said made in 490 moves. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3397.44s)]
*  Forced made. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3402.4s)]
*  Now, I can tell you that even being a very decent player, for the first 400 moves, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3403.76s)]
*  I could hardly understand why these pieces moved around like a dance. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3409.92s)]
*  It's endless dance around the board. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3413.76s)]
*  You don't see any pattern. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3416.32s)]
*  Trust me, no pattern because they move from one side to another. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3418.96s)]
*  And at certain points, I saw, oh, but white even, you know, white position deteriorated. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  It was better 50 moves before. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3428.96s)]
*  Now, the question is, and this is a big question. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3432.72s)]
*  So if there are certain positions in these end games, like seven pieces end games, that [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3435.44s)]
*  take by the best play of both sides, 500 moves to win the game. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3441.2s)]
*  What does it tell us about the quality of the game that we play, which is an average 50 moves? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3446.8799999999997s)]
*  It means you're clueless in the entire universe. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3452.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3455.8399999999997s)]
*  So that's an interesting philosophical question. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3456.24s)]
*  And I have to confess, I don't know the answer. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3458.8799999999997s)]
*  Imagine how bad our politics would look. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3461.04s)]
*  Now, this brings us to another point. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3464.24s)]
*  So maybe with machines, we can actually move our knowledge much further. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3466.72s)]
*  We can understand how to play decent games at much greater lengths. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3473.04s)]
*  Now, going back to computer chess, and I don't know how much time you spend looking at the [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3479.12s)]
*  computer matches. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3483.52s)]
*  Quite a bit. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3485.04s)]
*  Quite a bit. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3485.68s)]
*  Now, I think you can confirm my observations that there's something strange in these games. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3486.56s)]
*  First of all, they're longer, of course. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3493.2s)]
*  They're much longer because machines don't make the same mistake. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3495.12s)]
*  So they could play 70, 80 moves, 100 moves. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3497.3599999999997s)]
*  So 70, 80 moves is a normal length. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3500.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3502.56s)]
*  Still, by the way, it's still 70, 80 moves. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3502.96s)]
*  It's still not fine. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3504.96s)]
*  It's way, way below what we expect from perfect chess. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3506.8s)]
*  That tells us that machines are not perfect. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3512.0s)]
*  But most of these games are decided by one of the machines, suddenly, can I call it losing [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3514.56s)]
*  patience? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3522.64s)]
*  Because you have a position that is roughly even. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3523.92s)]
*  It's maneuvers, and they go around the pieces from one side to another. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3526.08s)]
*  And then suddenly one machine makes a, you may call it human mistake. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3530.16s)]
*  Suddenly, it loses patience and it tries to break up without a good reason behind it. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3533.92s)]
*  My driverless car will do this someday. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3542.7200000000003s)]
*  But that's the, no, that also tells us that these, the machines, that's interesting [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3544.7200000000003s)]
*  observation from also my experience, that machines also have, you may call it psychology, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3550.32s)]
*  the pattern in decision making. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3557.04s)]
*  And if we understand this pattern, so we can make certain predictions. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3559.2000000000003s)]
*  So it's not all predetermined. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3562.48s)]
*  There's so many things that can go one way or another. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3565.04s)]
*  And that means that we will not be run by these mystical AI. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3567.92s)]
*  It's not perfect. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3576.88s)]
*  It's far from perfect. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3577.84s)]
*  There's so many IRS, it doesn't know how to cover. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3579.52s)]
*  Even setting aside a simple question, whether the brains can function effectively separately [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3583.28s)]
*  from the body. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3590.2400000000002s)]
*  What does it mean that you have brains that are not part of the moving, of our moving body? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3591.6800000000003s)]
*  So can you separate it and still have the same effect? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3599.28s)]
*  My answer is I don't know. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3603.52s)]
*  And that's what I believe is good. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3605.28s)]
*  Because that tells us that there's so much to learn in this process. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3607.44s)]
*  And for those who are predicting that AI is just around the corner and is going to wipe us out, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3612.0s)]
*  they don't know what they're talking about. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3620.16s)]
*  So it's more like a future of inscrutability and periodic surprises. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3621.52s)]
*  But we also know that the doomsday has been always very popular pastime when it comes to [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3626.3199999999997s)]
*  technology. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3630.56s)]
*  Because it's easy. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3632.4s)]
*  You know, it's us against them, the race against the machines, the war against the machines. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3633.12s)]
*  You can sell it. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3637.2s)]
*  And I think it's important that people stop looking at this either from a utopian point of view. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3638.4s)]
*  Oh, we'll just get together. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3643.36s)]
*  We'll fly to Alpha Centauri with machines. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3645.2799999999997s)]
*  They will serve us in this endless spaceflight. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3648.0s)]
*  Or to the contrary, it's a Skynet that is going to kill all of us. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3652.4s)]
*  It's a process. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3656.4s)]
*  It's a process and we should be objective. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3657.44s)]
*  This is not too optimistic, not dark pessimism, but something that is more human, which is [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3659.36s)]
*  let's get objective. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3665.52s)]
*  Let's assess our chances and let's realize this is a process of developing for the human civilization [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3666.8s)]
*  and compared to the fears that people had about machines in the 90s and 20th century, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3676.88s)]
*  we're not pioneers. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3683.6800000000003s)]
*  Do we do our best thinking under pressure? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3685.12s)]
*  Yes, we do much better. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3688.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm also best, but we definitely perform much better. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3689.28s)]
*  Some people collapse, but as a… [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3692.32s)]
*  Aronian. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3694.6400000000003s)]
*  You can't say that. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3696.96s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3697.6800000000003s)]
*  As a humanity, of course we operate much more effectively under pressure. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3698.08s)]
*  Look at wars. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3704.88s)]
*  A lot of mistakes, though, are made in wars. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3706.56s)]
*  No, but exactly. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3708.3199999999997s)]
*  But mistakes are always made. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3709.2799999999997s)]
*  But we're talking about the performance. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3711.6s)]
*  That's why we can look at the productivity, look at what people can do by inventing new things. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3714.0s)]
*  So the moment they're under pressure, you can expect that part of the group [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3721.44s)]
*  will perform way above expectations. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3729.04s)]
*  Last question. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3732.24s)]
*  What has been your favorite city to play chess in and why? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3733.28s)]
*  Now it's simple because I don't play chess anywhere else but in St. Louis, Missouri. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3738.1600000000003s)]
*  But looking back, is it Moscow, is it Linares? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3744.0s)]
*  Is it some city because it's beautiful? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3747.0400000000004s)]
*  I played more chess in Linares than anywhere else in the world, I guess. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3749.2000000000003s)]
*  And you've done very well there. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3754.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I did well. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3755.36s)]
*  Now, in terms of perfect results, I would say Paris. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3756.96s)]
*  I played a few events, but most remarkably, five rapid chess tournaments. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3761.2000000000003s)]
*  And I won four of them. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3771.2000000000003s)]
*  And I was in the final in all five. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3773.1200000000003s)]
*  So that's the... [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3775.2000000000003s)]
*  In terms of, again, rating my performance, I don't think any city will come close to Paris. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3776.5600000000004s)]
*  And the city of Paris never distracts you when you're there? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3782.72s)]
*  If you're there to play chess, you play chess. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3785.2799999999997s)]
*  No, look, Paris is always Paris. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3787.52s)]
*  But again, the results were perfect, nearly perfect. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3790.16s)]
*  I'm not thinking about other places now, but I don't think that's... [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3795.6s)]
*  Is there a home disadvantage? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3799.7599999999998s)]
*  So Anand playing in Chennai, his whole entourage is there. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3801.12s)]
*  He's a big hero in India, his family is around. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3804.48s)]
*  He has to juggle competing demands, is it better? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3807.2s)]
*  He lost to Magnussen Sochi as well. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3809.4399999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3811.68s)]
*  So no home court disadvantage in chess? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3813.52s)]
*  It could be advantage, could be disadvantage, because it's a pressure. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3818.56s)]
*  You play at home. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3823.7599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, I never played at home because my home was... [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3824.88s)]
*  Except, okay, 1980, I played in Baku. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3828.24s)]
*  It was a tournament when I made my second GM Grand Masters norm. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3831.04s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3834.64s)]
*  But that was not such a big challenge. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3835.2s)]
*  Of course, people wanted me to win, but I was much stronger than the rest of the field. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3837.52s)]
*  It was all about me competing with Belyaski for the first prize. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3841.44s)]
*  Everyone knew I would be a Grand Master there. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3845.2000000000003s)]
*  Big matches. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3850.0s)]
*  When I played Moscow or with Karpov or just other events, it was not considered to be home. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3853.12s)]
*  So it's the... [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3859.52s)]
*  Though I was not very successful in Moscow when you look at overall performance. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3861.04s)]
*  So, in other words, if you play at home and just think about Anand and Magnus, or you're a guest, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3866.32s)]
*  so it's a pressure on both players. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3876.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just extra pressure and it depends who can handle it better. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3878.16s)]
*  But since Magnus beat Anand both in Chennai and in Sochi next year, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3881.6s)]
*  I don't think that the home factor or guest factor played a major role. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3887.84s)]
*  Oh, and one final question. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3894.64s)]
*  I forgot. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3895.92s)]
*  Who is the most likely challenger to Magnus Carlsen this next time around? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3896.3199999999997s)]
*  Considering the logic of the world championship history, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3902.08s)]
*  Magnus should face opposition from a younger player or the same age. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3907.2s)]
*  So I would say there are three players that I guess could challenge him. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3911.44s)]
*  Maxim Vassilievich Ligrov. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3920.7999999999997s)]
*  I would rate him as the least probable among the three. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3922.4s)]
*  Second, Karouan, and the most likely Wesley Saw. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3926.48s)]
*  The reason I put Wesley ahead of two others is that he has phenomenal concentration. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3931.28s)]
*  Absolutely phenomenal. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3937.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's very important. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3938.7200000000003s)]
*  These days, concentration trumps everything. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3940.2400000000002s)]
*  I would put it on top of other things, though he's a very, very good player. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3945.92s)]
*  He might be among the three, he might be the most dangerous for Magnus. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3950.48s)]
*  Because he has nothing to lose, he feels? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3957.2000000000003s)]
*  No, it's because his concentration could overboard Magnus. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3959.52s)]
*  Magnus concentration was all his strengths. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3970.08s)]
*  He was always very concentrated. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3974.4s)]
*  He could mobilize all his resources for the game. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3976.24s)]
*  Now, with Saw, Magnus could feel, again, it's a bi-educated guess, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3981.12s)]
*  Saw hasn't qualified for the candidates, he still has to win it. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3986.3199999999997s)]
*  But against the Wesley Saw, Magnus could have some serious problems in reading his opponent. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3989.68s)]
*  And also just messing up his energy. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=3997.52s)]
*  Saw could reflect. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4001.3599999999997s)]
*  Though I think it's matchless, Karuana could be also uncertain. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4002.4s)]
*  And if Vasheligraf makes some improvements, more psychological improvements, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4006.32s)]
*  he could be also dangerous. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4011.6s)]
*  He's the same age. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4012.8s)]
*  Karuana is younger, Saw is even younger than Karuana. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4014.08s)]
*  So I would bet on these three as one of the Magnus Challenger, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4017.76s)]
*  ranking them in the following quarter. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4026.88s)]
*  Saw, Karuana, and Will. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7CNbBoiTpc&t=4028.8s)]
