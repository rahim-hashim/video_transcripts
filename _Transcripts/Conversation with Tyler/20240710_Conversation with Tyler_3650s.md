# Brian Winter on Brazil, Argentina, and the Future of Latin America  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15S2xPqYnoI)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm chatting with Brian Winter.
*  Let me just give you the introduction from Brian himself.
*  He's the editor-in-chief of America's Quarterly and a longstanding analyst of Latin American
*  politics, with more than 20 years following the region.
*  He's lived in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.
*  He was a correspondent for Reuters.
*  He also has been vice president of policy for the Americas Society and Council of the
*  Americas.
*  He's been called the best foreign expert on Brazil of this moment.
*  He's the author of several books, including Why Soccer Matters, a New York Times best
*  seller, co-authored with Brazilian soccer legend Pele, the accidental president of Brazil,
*  co-authored with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Long After Midnight, a memoir
*  about trying and failing to learn to tango in Argentina.
*  He's a regular contributor to television and radio, a host of the America's Quarterly
*  podcast and a prolific barbequeur and chef.
*  I very much enjoy following him on Twitter at Brazil Brian, and that's Brazil with a
*  Z.
*  Brian, welcome.
*  It's such an honor, Tyler.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  I have so many questions.
*  Let me start with a simple one.
*  Why is Brazil stuck?
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  I actually, you know, I take a longer view on Brazil.
*  I've been following the country for almost 20 years now, and I've seen progress.
*  This is a country that has its challenges, but it is one of the hemisphere's most solid
*  democracies.
*  It is a country that has lifted millions out of poverty over the last 20 years.
*  It's more of a middle class country than it used to be.
*  And I know what you mean by stuck.
*  It's an economy that doesn't grow nearly enough.
*  It has this political turmoil that makes headlines every now and then.
*  But if you take that longer view, it's a better place than it was when I first started following
*  it back in the 2000s.
*  Say they just grow at about 2%, which has been common lately now that the China boom,
*  the Soviet boom are over.
*  Their fertility seems to be about 1.55.
*  I mean, what's the future?
*  Don't they just shrink and get poorer?
*  We might all shrink, Tyler.
*  This is not a question that Brazil alone is facing.
*  We're seeing it across the Western world.
*  But the danger here is real.
*  It's the same danger that faces China as well.
*  It's the danger that these countries will get old before they get rich.
*  And this is an issue we're seeing across much of the developing world.
*  What's the future of migration into Brazil?
*  So the US might be below replacement rates, but we can get a lot of the world's best immigrants.
*  Brazil doesn't seem very interested in recreating its early 20th century traditions when it
*  took in people from across the world.
*  Why not?
*  Is that going to change?
*  Is it just people coming from Paraguay?
*  What's the future of migration to Brazil?
*  As you rightly point out, Tyler, it's been a long time since Brazil was a real destination
*  for immigrants.
*  I'm actually working on a book about Sao Paulo right now and revisiting a lot of this history
*  when they had what they called the immigrants inn, which was in Sao Paulo and it received
*  thousands of immigrants at a time, mostly from Italy, also from Spain.
*  But Brazil also has the world's largest Japanese population outside Japan.
*  So many people came there from the old Ottoman Empire today, Syria and Lebanon, that the
*  mayors of Sao Paulo over the years have had names like Kassab, Haddad, Malouf.
*  It does have that tradition of immigration.
*  But that ended really with the Great Depression and the crash in coffee prices back when Brazil
*  was producing as much as three quarters of the world's coffee.
*  It was a real blow to them and kind of changed everything.
*  And you're right, it's not a big receiver of immigrants today, although there are about
*  500,000 Venezuelans who've come there in recent years fleeing the collapse of the socialist
*  dictatorship there.
*  It has an equally sized population of people from Bolivia.
*  So it still receives not as much as it otherwise might.
*  I have to say that Portuguese is part of the challenge here.
*  It's a language that not that many people know.
*  And so, for example, even for the Venezuelans, that's out of a diaspora of eight million.
*  Most of them have gone to other Spanish speaking countries, but the ones that have gone to
*  Brazil have been pretty happy with their decision.
*  Why is Brazilian agriculture not stuck?
*  Productivity there seems to be very high, right?
*  What's Brazil doing right in this one area?
*  Well, you know, having a privileged location in the tropics and being able to have two
*  harvests a year sometimes because of the climate and the soil, that helps.
*  But plenty of countries have that, right?
*  Brazil's done something unusual.
*  Well, there's an old expression that thankfully is a bit out of date now that said that held
*  that Brazil was the most efficient farming country in the world until goods left the
*  farm.
*  And what that was a reference to was the fact that the roads, infrastructure, rail ports
*  and so on were not really up to par.
*  But there has been an improvement.
*  Not enough.
*  But again, this is another area where of the last 20 years, this soy that used to travel
*  over two lane or even one lane mud roads, at least now it's paved in a lot of places.
*  And some of these rail links are also improving.
*  So this is another area where I think if you if you take that longer term perspective,
*  things are getting a little bit better.
*  What's the economic geography of Brazil going to look like?
*  All the wealth, the wealth near Mato Grosso and the north just very, very poor or the
*  north empties out or how's that going to work?
*  There used to be some modest degree of balance.
*  That's true.
*  Most of the population in Brazil and the economic center for sure was in the southeast.
*  And that means really Sao Paulo state, which is about a quarter of Brazil's population,
*  but roughly a third of its GDP.
*  Rio as well, the state of Minas Gerais, which has a name that tells its history.
*  That means general mines in Portuguese.
*  That's the area where a lot of the gold came out of in the 18th and 19th centuries.
*  That's gone now. So it's not as much of an economic pull.
*  You're right, Tyler, though, that a lot of the the the real boom right now,
*  the action is in places like Mato Grosso, which is in the region of Brazil called the
*  center west. That soy country.
*  I'm from Texas and Mato Grosso is virtually indistinguishable from Texas these days.
*  It's hot. It's flat.
*  The crop is, you know, like I said, is soy.
*  There's cattle ranching as well.
*  Even the music, you know, Brazil has, as others have noted, has gone from being the
*  country of bossa nova and the samba in the 1970s to being the country of Sertanejo today.
*  Sertanejo is kind of a Brazilian cousin of country music with accordions,
*  but it's sung by people, men mostly in jeans, big belt buckles and cowboy hats.
*  And so they're importing that not only that economic model, but that lifestyle as well.
*  What is the great Brazilian music of today?
*  MPB's dead, right? So what should someone listen to?
*  Well, I have a guilty love for Sertanejo.
*  Again, I've revealed myself as a Texan to your listeners who likes the classics like
*  George Strait and Clint Black and, you know, some of the big names from the 80s and 90s.
*  Sertanejo is a bit different, but, you know, if hip hop is your thing,
*  Anita Tutis is the big artist of the moment.
*  But it's not to the despair of some that culture today, perhaps because it is somewhat
*  derivative of country music in the United States.
*  It is not taking over the world in the same way that Jean Gilberto and Gilberto Gil and
*  so many others did in the 1950s and 1960s.
*  How do you think that being a Texan makes you more optimistic about Brazil if you would
*  even accept the claim at all?
*  Well, that's a really good question.
*  I certainly makes me appreciate, you know, the cowboy culture and churrasco,
*  which is the Brazilian barbecue culture as well.
*  I think, you know, both places, in addition to being hot and green, are forward looking.
*  I came to Brazil from Argentina.
*  I lived in Argentina first.
*  Argentina is a country that is obsessively focused on its past.
*  That's a country that a hundred years ago famously was one of the 10 richest countries
*  in the world.
*  And today is slipped back well into the middle of the pack somewhere in the 60s, depending
*  on what indicator you're looking at.
*  And so, you know, Argentina is a tango.
*  It's nostalgia.
*  It's melancholy.
*  And Brazil has always been about the future, sometimes to a fault.
*  It's not a place where people remember precedent, where they remember lessons of history.
*  They're focused on the future.
*  If you grew up in a place like Dallas, like I did, which was built entirely for the most
*  part in the 20th century, I think there's probably something of that that resonates
*  with me.
*  But is Brazil still looking toward the future?
*  So as you know, they built Brasilia in the middle of nowhere.
*  Whatever you think of Brasilia, it was quite an achievement.
*  It's hard for me to imagine them doing that now.
*  I've read that Outback Steakhouse is quite popular in Brazil.
*  You've talked about rap music, derivatives of country and Western.
*  Where's the real future looking forward, looking element in Brazil?
*  Where do you see it?
*  I think you see it.
*  This may sound a bit hokey, Tyler, but you feel it when you talk to people.
*  It's a country of smiles, of people who sometimes live just incredibly difficult lives.
*  I'm talking about people who live in the periphery of cities like Sao Paulo and Brazil,
*  who spend five hours a day on a bus commuting in and out of traffic in order to work minimum
*  wage jobs.
*  These people enjoy life, sometimes more than, I would say often more than the people that
*  I live among in Westchester County, just outside New York, who I look around sometimes on the
*  commuter train and nobody looks happy.
*  I don't want to romanticize things.
*  I think that you find unhappy people in Brazil too, but there's a joy in life that people
*  manage to seize upon even when the economy is not doing well, perhaps because they're
*  accustomed to this kind of slow growth situation that we've been talking about.
*  Here's a question from a reader, and I quote, does the change in the style of play of Brazil's
*  national soccer team over the last 20 years, more disciplined and rigorous, with fewer
*  players free to create a result of a change in the national culture or vibe?
*  I think that Brazilians would probably tell you that actually the soccer team has not
*  evolved enough, because I would gently point out, because I know that there are Brazilian
*  listeners here who will recoil when I say this, but it has been 22 years since Brazil
*  won the last World Cup, which is quite serious for a country that has won five World Cups
*  over the years, more than any other country.
*  There's a real view that I hear from people in the country that actually part of the problem
*  improvisation and talent are not enough anymore, and that Brazilian soccer really needs to
*  professionalize.
*  Now they continue to produce amazing players, Neymar, Vinicius Jr., and others, but they
*  also have another disadvantage, which is that so many more of their players these days are
*  in, they play club soccer in Europe.
*  If you look back at the Golden Age, the age with Pelé, these were players who played
*  almost entirely on teams within Brazil who knew each other, and perhaps that was an advantage
*  as well.
*  But do you think there's something about the Brazilian spirit or national psyche that somehow
*  worked better in the world of the 1950s and 60s, where improvisation was more relevant,
*  maybe more productive?
*  In a lot of areas, cinema, you have a movie such as Black Orpheus, I'm sure you know it.
*  Is there anything comparable today that has global force?
*  A Brazilian movie, something?
*  What would it be?
*  That's a good question, Tyler.
*  And to be honest, I'm at a bit of a loss, and this is something that Brazilian commentators
*  have also seized upon, this idea that the cool Brazil, the one that people of a certain
*  age think of that comes to mind, Samba, the Beats of Bossa Nova, Black Orpheus to take
*  the example you cited, that's not present today.
*  And there's been a lot of soul searching within Brazil as to why that is.
*  They watch, for example, the prominence that South Korea has taken on in shows like, oh
*  gosh, what's the one on Netflix, the really violent one that everybody-
*  Squid Game.
*  Squid Game.
*  A lot of Brazilians saw that in the cultural moment of K-pop and everything else and said,
*  that used to be us.
*  What has happened to us that we're no longer on the main stage to the degree that we were
*  in the past?
*  And I think some of it is that others have caught up.
*  And then perhaps there's a cyclical element to this as well.
*  I can tell you that Brazil remains a tremendously seductive place to visit.
*  You spend time in places like Sao Paulo, Rio, Salvador, and you still see echoes of that
*  Brazil that seduced the world once upon a time and continues to do so, not necessarily
*  as part of pop culture, but certainly to people who visit.
*  How is it that you understand the current crime situation in Sao Paulo?
*  As I'm sure you know, the murder rate has dropped a great deal.
*  But if you actually walk on the streets, it doesn't feel very good.
*  In some ways, the older, more violent Sao Paulo seemed cleaner or to have fewer derelicts.
*  What's the general framework for making sense of what's gone on there?
*  It's a really perceptive question, Tyler.
*  The crime situation there is a complex story.
*  Their homicide rate has actually gone down more than 80% over the last 25 years.
*  It's a tremendous achievement.
*  It was one of the world's most violent in terms of homicide cities as recently as the
*  late 90s.
*  And then that rate now is only about five per 100,000, which is lower than the US national
*  average and quite a bit lower than many US cities.
*  But, and there's a but here, but it is a country or city rather, where you are still much
*  more likely to be a victim of an armed robbery, of a carjacking, to have your cell phone taken
*  from your hands.
*  And so a lot of people, when they go there, either as visitors or members of the economic
*  elite in Sao Paulo choose to have armored cars, choose to not pull out their cell phone
*  when they're out on the street.
*  As a matter of fact, with the spread of payment apps and Brazil's digital currency, which
*  is an amazing story in itself, it's called PIX, a lot of Brazilian friends I know have
*  stopped taking their cell phone out of the house at all because they're afraid that either
*  the phone will be stolen or they'll be the victims of a kidnapping and made to empty
*  their account.
*  So, you know, that's that's a reality.
*  That's serious.
*  And so I have, you know, I've been very interested in the progress that they have made on the
*  homicide front.
*  But when you talk to ordinary people, regular people in Sao Paulo, the perception is that
*  violence has not gotten any better.
*  And there's another issue here, which you made reference to, which is that the street
*  population has, by some measures, tripled in the last 10 years.
*  Now, some of that is the pandemic, but there seem to be other factors as well.
*  What do you think will happen with crime in Rio de Janeiro, the city?
*  Well, is that even stable?
*  Can it continue?
*  Right.
*  It seems something has to give.
*  Rio, in some ways, is a repeat of the story that I just told about Sao Paulo, but without
*  the progress from a security standpoint, it remains very worthwhile to visit.
*  It's also an economic center, a cultural center of the country.
*  There's a lot more to these places besides just street crime.
*  But the fact is, it's a very complicated situation.
*  You have these groups that Brazilians call milicias, which sounds like militias, but
*  they're really best thought of as paramilitary groups.
*  These are groups that are often composed of police officers who control organized crime
*  in vast areas of the city.
*  And look, it's another area where Brazil has work to do.
*  And these are challenges that are faced all across Latin America.
*  One of the big stories happening in Latin America right now is this spread of organized
*  crime, which was already bad.
*  This has always been an issue as long as I've been following the region.
*  But with the doubling in the production of cocaine that we've seen over the last 10 years
*  and keeping in mind that almost all the world's cocaine is produced in just three countries,
*  that's Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, the smuggling routes lead out of those countries and go
*  touch virtually every other country in Latin America.
*  And the illegality and organized crime that takes root around that is the source of a
*  lot of these issues.
*  What do you think is the most significant change of mind or change of opinion you've
*  had in the last 10 years about race relations in Brazil?
*  So one reads a great deal about this.
*  Obviously, it's different from America.
*  But since you've started, what is it you've changed your mind about?
*  What new insights do you have now?
*  What you didn't have 10 or 20 years ago.
*  Race is a subject in Brazil that I always approach with humility as an American, because
*  we, of course, have our own amply documented issues.
*  And racism in Brazil is different in some ways, but similar in others.
*  There has been a huge debate within Brazil about identity and the nature of Brazilian
*  racism over the last 10 years or so.
*  One consequence of this, Tyler, is that the percentage of people who identify as black
*  or mixed race has gone way up in census data in that time.
*  It's gone from, I believe, somewhere in the upper 40s to about 56 percent today.
*  And it's not because Brazil became more black or had more mixed race people, but because
*  people are more inclined to identify themselves with pride as being part of that group.
*  And it's all a saga that has been going on for hundreds of years, that has echoes in
*  the same history that we have here in the US.
*  But in some ways, it happens on a bigger scale in Brazil.
*  Here's a figure that people are always surprised, Americans are always surprised to learn.
*  Brazil imported more than five million people from Africa from the 16th century through
*  1850. That is more than 10 times the number of slaves that were imported into the United
*  States. And so we're talking about an issue that has had reverberations that in some ways
*  are far bigger. At the same time, there was always more mixing of the races in Brazil.
*  So, you know, segregation along racial lines was never a thing, in part because it was
*  not feasible because there had been so much mixing.
*  But there was a long tradition in Brazil, especially among the elite, of claiming that
*  there was no racism in Brazil.
*  And I think the country has come to grips with the fact that that's not true, that
*  there was racism, that it was different from racism in the United States, but racism
*  nonetheless. And so people are grappling with that at the same time that they're more
*  inclined to identify themselves as black, which is a fascinating thing to watch.
*  For you, which is the most interesting ethnic small town in southern Brazil?
*  Ethnic small town, you're referring to like the German communities and places.
*  Like Pomeroda, somewhere like that.
*  For me, it was fascinating.
*  I'd like to hear your story of Pomeroda, but I have to say my favorite example of an
*  ethnic enclave in Brazil is actually in Sao Paulo.
*  It's a neighborhood called Liberdade, which means freedom, means liberty.
*  And this was the pole for the Japanese community that came to Brazil starting in the
*  1900s and has, as I said earlier, is the biggest Japanese community outside Japan.
*  They have integrated themselves exceptionally well into the country.
*  You walk through this neighborhood and you see sushi places, ramen restaurants, and
*  then coconut water and tropical juices.
*  This neighborhood is also notable for other reasons.
*  And prior to becoming a Japanese neighborhood in the 17th and 18th century, well, the
*  name tells it all.
*  Liberdade. It was one of the first neighborhoods where freed slaves in Sao Paulo lived.
*  And it has that whole history that is also being uncovered kind of as we speak as this
*  part of this moment of racial awakening that I already described.
*  For me, Pomeroda was so boring.
*  It was interesting, incredibly fine.
*  North German architecture.
*  The dialect maybe almost sounded like Plattdeutsch.
*  I'm not sure.
*  People didn't believe me when I said I was an American.
*  It just, none of the categories made sense to them.
*  People were friendly.
*  It felt German.
*  This was the 1990s and it was like a time warp more than anything.
*  Nowhere in Germany would be the way Pomeroda was in the 1990s.
*  There are also, Brazil has that.
*  There are dishes and dances of the old Japanese community that have been preserved in
*  Brazil in a way that they were not in Japan.
*  So it's a country in part because of that rich tradition of immigration that we were
*  discussing earlier that has all kinds of enclaves like that that are fascinating to
*  visit.
*  Where is the best churrasco in Brazil?
*  At somebody's ranch, if you can manage.
*  But say in commercial markets, I would say outside of Curitiba in some of the suburbs,
*  but I'm not sure.
*  There's plenty of parts I've never been to.
*  It's hard to go wrong.
*  I've had some amazing churrasco in Sao Paulo, but also up in the new cattle country up in
*  Mato Grosso.
*  They bring it.
*  Well, I assume a lot of your audience has been to the all you can eat ojizos of Brazilian
*  barbecue here in the US.
*  It's basically like that.
*  But what you don't always get here in the US is these vast buffets of other things where
*  you can get your picanha, which is the classic.
*  They always translate that as rump steak, which makes it sound terrible.
*  But it's the best, most classic Brazilian cut.
*  But to then line that up with hearts of palm that are sometimes almost the size and
*  diameter of like a flagpole.
*  Those are my favorite.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a real treat.
*  More memorable than the beef.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  Awesome.
*  Some questions about other countries.
*  If we look around Latin America, one can see that Nicaragua and Cuba are quite safe.
*  The cost of getting there has been way, way too high, right?
*  They're not successful countries.
*  But does that strengthen the case for buccolet that in essence, there's not any simple way?
*  To a safe Latin American country, if you start out dangerous.
*  Well, what you say is true in the sense that police states can be quite safe and
*  Nicaragua and Cuba are places where no type of dissent is tolerated today.
*  El Salvador, it's not there yet.
*  I think it's fair to wonder whether that is what Naib Bukele has in mind.
*  Of course, Naib Bukele being the, you already named him the very charismatic
*  millennial El Salvadoran leader with the backwards baseball cap.
*  What he has done is throw more than 1% of his country's population in jail.
*  To give you over the course of a year, and El Salvador is not a big country.
*  So to put that in proportional terms, to do the equivalent thing in the United
*  States, that would be putting more than 3 million more people in jail in the course
*  of 12 months. That's how dramatic what Bukele has done.
*  And so far, it has met with success in terms of reducing homicide numbers.
*  El Salvador's official homicide index is now lower than that of the United States.
*  There's some question about whether those numbers are accurate, but there's
*  certainly the trend is real, is very clear.
*  The problem, of course, is that he's done that without, in many cases, due process
*  for the people who he's put in jail.
*  Is there a better alternative?
*  Well, I think yes, but it takes time.
*  It involves building up your police forces, professionalizing your judiciary.
*  And sending people the old fashioned way to jail by putting them on trial first.
*  For societies that are not willing to tolerate that, that don't have that
*  patience because they think that they're going through a crisis, an emergency.
*  I have to say, I mean, I understand why Bukele has an approval rating upwards of 80%
*  because the results are real.
*  And the history of the world is full of death societies, including democratic
*  societies that have been willing to suspend civil liberties in the name of a
*  national emergency.
*  We did that here in the United States during the civil war with the suspension
*  of habeas corpus, we did it with the internment camps of the World War II
*  era with the Japanese population.
*  And, you know, we as a society almost always regret these things after the fact,
*  but they're seen as necessary at the time.
*  The real debate for me about that Bukele awakens is we may think, I may think that
*  what Bukele is doing is anti-democratic.
*  But if he just was voted a second term as president with a huge mandate,
*  then arguably El Salvador's society has a democratic sovereign right to make that
*  decision and to sign off on what he's doing, which is again, sending a lot of
*  people, including almost certainly innocent people, to jail.
*  And if that's a cost that Salvadoran society is willing to take, then perhaps
*  they have a right to do that.
*  It remains to be seen how exportable that model is to other countries in the
*  region. You hear a lot of politicians saying nice things about Bukele, but no
*  other country really has yet gone down that path.
*  Ecuador, Honduras are trying a bit, but halfheartedly, right?
*  And it may be an all or nothing thing if you're going to make it work.
*  Otherwise, gang members just train other gang members.
*  Well, look, we do have examples in history, recent history.
*  Imperfect examples of countries that reduced violence and that broke the grip
*  of drug gangs under democracy.
*  I would cite Colombia of the 2000s.
*  Now, this was a period that saw many abuses, human rights abuses, a military,
*  a Colombian military that we now know killed thousands of innocent people.
*  But to the extent that it's possible to say, but after a declaration like that,
*  homicide rates did dramatically fall and it's a very different feeling country
*  than it used to be. So point is, Bukele is not the only route, but I agree with
*  you when you say that there is no easy, fast, democratic route to improving
*  security when you're dealing with cartels and organized crime groups that have the
*  resources that some of these groups do with their pockets filled with the dollars
*  of customers of cocaine in the United States, Europe, and other countries around
*  Latin America.
*  Speaking of Colombia, I have a question about the country.
*  I've never understood this.
*  So if I look at the history long term, it seems, not seems, it is quite violent,
*  even by Latin standards.
*  If I look at the history of economic growth in Colombia, it's actually fairly
*  smooth and steady.
*  Is there any single theory of the country that can account for both of those facts?
*  Always skeptical of simple, neat theories, but I would point to geography.
*  Colombia, in a way, is unique.
*  It is a country where the capital is on top of the mountain in Bogota.
*  Colombia is a country of plateaus.
*  It is a very difficult territory for any central authority to control.
*  Some have compared it, and by some I mean development agencies at the UN and others
*  have compared it in terms of its geography to Afghanistan with areas that are just
*  completely separated from each other.
*  The story in Colombia over time has been that of a competent government in Bogota
*  that does not control all of the national territories.
*  It remains true today.
*  There are vast pockets of the country that federal authority simply does not get
*  there, and that has been a big reason why they never had, it was one of the very few
*  Latin American countries that never defaulted on its debt in the 1980s.
*  They never had a hyperinflation.
*  Their economy, Tyler, as you noted, has almost always consistently grown, but yet
*  they've had these huge problems with guerrilla movements and general lawlessness,
*  partly because of geography and partly because of a, let's say, a lack of political
*  will to go and dominate, subdue, bring rule of law to these parts of the country that
*  were not under the federal umbrella.
*  It's not just about geography.
*  It's about political will as well.
*  But a good civil service, right?
*  A breathtakingly competent civil service, but it's not just about geography.
*  There's a certain consensus around the need for sound fiscal management, which anyone
*  who follows Latin America knows is not something you should ever take for granted.
*  So no, like a lot of these countries, they have things that they've done well and
*  things that areas where they still need to improve.
*  What's the most interesting lesser known part of Colombia to visit?
*  Oh, gosh, I am not sure it's lesser known.
*  I am quite taken with Cartagena as many visitors are.
*  Medellin, the land of the eternal spring.
*  Monteria is an area I've been to that looks a lot like the Mato Grosso and the cattle
*  country in Brazil that we were discussing earlier.
*  It's a beautiful place.
*  I would say having stuttered around this a little bit, my favorite place is the Sierra
*  Nevada, which is unique in the global context.
*  It's as the name suggests, it's a snowy range of mountains from which you can see
*  the Caribbean Sea.
*  The fact that there is a mountain range where you can simultaneously see the Caribbean
*  and sometimes there is snow on the ground never ceases to amaze me.
*  It is a beautiful place.
*  One of these troubled parts of the country where for a long time and intermittently,
*  federal authority kind of comes and goes.
*  But if you can ever manage to go and feel safe, there's few places in the world quite
*  like that.
*  You know, I'm bringing my sister for bird watching to Santa Marta in May, which is not
*  so far from there, right?
*  What are your favorite birds?
*  What are you hoping to see while you're there?
*  It's really a trip for my sister.
*  She's a well-known amateur bird photographer.
*  She's heavily into bird watching.
*  I'm not, but I'm heavily into Colombia and I've been enough places that I feel I can
*  bring her around and she wouldn't go on her own.
*  So we're doing it.
*  Good for you.
*  Yeah.
*  Argentina.
*  Why is the jockey club so popular in Buenos Aires?
*  I'm sure you've noticed this.
*  I have noticed this.
*  Well, I think two reasons.
*  One is that Argentina is regarded even today by many as the heart of polo culture and
*  horse culture globally.
*  I mean, it's really, people say it's Florida and Provincia de Buenos Aires are the main
*  places to be.
*  But a lot of this also, Tyler, as I was saying earlier, everything or almost everything in
*  Argentina ends up being about past glory and past wealth.
*  And the jockey club is really one of those places still left in the city where you can
*  look around and sort of squint a little bit.
*  Imagine it's 1920 and that this is still the, quote unquote, Paris of South America.
*  It's not the only place that's like that.
*  It's actually the city itself looks good.
*  It looks better than it did when I covered Argentina's economic meltdown in my first job
*  out of college more than 20 years ago.
*  But the economy today, speaking of things that are cyclical, you've got inflation above
*  270 percent.
*  So it doesn't take long, even at the jockey club, to realize that not all is well in the
*  country right now.
*  I agree with your nostalgia point.
*  But as I'm sure you know, there's so many very good startups from Argentina, though they
*  may leave the country, go to Brazil, go to Mexico.
*  Why is there this mix of creativity and nostalgia?
*  I'm not sure they're mutually exclusive.
*  I would say I would I would frame it slightly differently.
*  The intellectual capital and firepower that you see in Argentina is still very strong.
*  I've always believed as someone who's probably spent too many hours of my life thinking
*  about Argentine decline, cultural and intellectual capital erodes less quickly than
*  economic capital.
*  And you still see these amazing centers of excellence in Buenos Aires.
*  And what these entrepreneurs will tell you, the founders of these companies that you
*  mentioned like Mercado Libre or Globa that have really become world beaters on the global
*  stage. I mean, Mercado Libre at this point is one of the biggest e-commerce countries,
*  companies in the entire world competes with Amazon.
*  What these founders will tell you is that actually starting their businesses in such an
*  uncertain macroeconomic environment has made them incredibly lean, disciplined and ready
*  to go out into the world and dominate.
*  The idea being that if you can make it in Argentina where conditions can dramatically
*  change from one day to the next, almost like the weather, then you can survive damn near
*  anything. And that has been one reason why a lot of these companies have had so much
*  success on the global stage.
*  I mean, you look around Spanish speaking Latin America and the big tech giants, the ones
*  that really dominate with some exceptions, they tend to be Argentine.
*  Why is psychoanalysis still so popular in Buenos Aires?
*  A lot of people. It's a very popular question.
*  It's not just popular. It is, according to several studies, it is the world's highest per
*  capita rate of psychoanalysis.
*  Freud was very big there over the years.
*  And having lived there for four years myself, I never saw one, but virtually every
*  Argentine friend did.
*  And they spoke about it in a way that was very natural.
*  Like I went to the gym this morning and then I went to the supermarket to buy some bread.
*  And after that, I went to see my analyst for one and a half hours because we're
*  reconstructing my personality.
*  And people would say that with a with a just in the most natural way, as if there was
*  nothing to it.
*  Why has the Uruguay success story so accelerated recently?
*  Uruguay is a fascinating story, Tyler.
*  It's a country of just three point three million people that I think a lot of people, if
*  we're honest, people would struggle to find it on a map.
*  But it is, despite its small size, has been a real success story.
*  It was always different in a Latin American context.
*  It was it was Latin America's first welfare state 100 years ago.
*  But and so, you know, I've been a big proponent of Uruguay story.
*  I wrote an article about it for America's Quarterly more than a year ago.
*  And a lot of people dismissed it and said, oh, well, you know, Uruguay, it's so small
*  and it's always been so wealthy that it's not really an example for the rest of the
*  region. But that's not true.
*  Twenty years ago, when Argentina's economy melted down the last time, it had a huge
*  contagion effect on Uruguay and poverty in Uruguay was actually 50 percent.
*  This was a country that was just flat on its back.
*  And today, that percentage is in the low double digits.
*  It's it's around 10 percent.
*  And there's back to this discussion we were having about crime and security.
*  There was no silver bullet.
*  What happened was they came out of that crisis 20 years ago and they realized that
*  there were certain things that needed to be done.
*  They needed a consensus around fiscal management, around sound management of the
*  economy. They needed to bring better regulations to their banks.
*  And sadly, but probably correctly, they concluded that they needed to reduce their
*  dependence on their neighbors, that they needed to depend less mainly on Argentina
*  and diversify. They're still undergoing that process today.
*  It's interesting. This is a country that has been knocking on furiously on the door of
*  the White House for several years now, trying to do a trade deal with the U.S.
*  met with, for the most part, unreceptive years in Washington.
*  But they are that's what they're trying to do.
*  It's a solid democracy.
*  It does better than the United States and some of these rankings of solid democracies
*  that get put together by the Economist Intelligence Unit and others.
*  And the beaches are beautiful, too.
*  So, you know, one day when I have to go fleeing into exile because of something I've
*  said or done, Uruguay is definitely on the top of my list.
*  Let's say you're a 30 year old couple, husband and wife.
*  You have two kids. You all speak Spanish or Portuguese and you have to relocate
*  somewhere in Latin America. Which city do you choose?
*  Maybe not permanent, but ongoing, you know, not six months, five or ten years.
*  Gosh, what a what a what a great question, Tyler.
*  You know, I think in terms of the best combination of economic opportunity,
*  relative safety, integration with the world, the possibility of upward mobility.
*  I would say Sao Paulo.
*  I really would.
*  Despite everything that we were saying earlier about the security risks, the crime
*  that is with Mexico City.
*  Those are the two truly international cities in Latin America.
*  There are other places that are great hubs.
*  I mean, I love Buenos Aires.
*  Santiago is also in Chile is it has great quality of life.
*  But if you're a citizen of the world, if you're trying to do business, the issue
*  that Argentina and Chile have is that they're far.
*  You know, these are this is really, you know, they're they're at the very extreme
*  end of the continent.
*  Sao Paulo is a bit more central and it's also a place Brazil writ large, but
*  Sao Paulo specifically where it's very easy to integrate yourself into local society.
*  I speak Portuguese, but with an accent.
*  It is the only place in Latin America where I can go to the corner bakery and order my
*  favorite juice, which is a suco de mamão com laranja, which is a papaya with orange juice.
*  That identifies me right away as a gringo.
*  Those vowels that I just said, every Brazilian will hear them and say this guy is not from
*  here. But I never felt I never felt like a foreigner in Sao Paulo, in part because it
*  has that tradition of people from all over the world and also all over the country.
*  Keeping in mind that Brazil is a country that's even bigger than the continental United
*  States. So if you balance all those things, I would choose I would choose Sao Paulo.
*  I like Sao Paulo, but doesn't it worry you or I find almost all of the city ugly.
*  It's so ugly.
*  Yes. And I would get that.
*  That would get on my nerves.
*  I'm tempted to say Panama City for myself.
*  Well, the name of the book that I'm working on about Sao Paulo right now that I mentioned
*  earlier, you'll appreciate then as the title is the ugliest city you'll ever love.
*  And it goes through this whole arc that I just spoke about and says why even though
*  it is a place that sometimes seems to be chasing away visitors, you come out of the
*  International Airport in Sao Paulo and you immediately pass not one but two high
*  security prisons and a sewage treatment plant.
*  And then you spend the next 30 minutes driving along an extremely polluted river, which
*  is the the the Hiotiate.
*  And it doesn't not everybody falls in love with it right away, but it is there is so
*  much there's such a great vibe.
*  It's you feel so welcome there as a foreigner.
*  And if you like the space on strange, but if you like work and I like work, Sao
*  Paulo is a great place to be as well.
*  It's a place where people take pride in what they do without being totally consumed by
*  it. It is still Brazil.
*  And so people also know how to party and have a good time.
*  I take it you agree with the standard view that most Latin American countries are fairly
*  happy relative to their income levels.
*  That has been borne out by surveys again and again.
*  It goes back to what I was saying earlier about these people who sometimes endure great
*  hardship and their exceptions to that.
*  I think there are a few exceptions.
*  Tell me what are the exceptions.
*  I don't think Guatemala is very happy.
*  And I think significant parts of Bolivia are not so happy.
*  Again, this is relative to income levels.
*  Yeah. These are country you're naming two of the poorest countries in the region.
*  And I do think that there's a point where and there's something else that has been
*  outside of these happiness surveys that we always see, which I always find funny.
*  The notion that the Scandinavia the countries of Scandinavia are the happiest in the
*  world. Maybe maybe so.
*  But look, as someone who spent 10 years of my life living in Latin America as a
*  reporter and continues to follow the region as part of my job, just speaking for myself,
*  there's there's several reasons why I do this.
*  I'm very interested in the question of why nations fail or succeed.
*  But I also I love these places.
*  I love these countries.
*  I love the happiness, the sense of humor, the value that people place upon family and
*  friends.
*  And it's tough sometimes because for my day job, I live now in New York and I engage
*  with the region so often now through a purely political lens.
*  Sometimes it feels like exactly the wrong lens to be engaging with the region.
*  During the pandemic in particular, when I was still writing about politics day to day,
*  but stuck here in New York, it was really tough because I had to keep reminding myself
*  there is so much more to these places than just the dysfunctional politics.
*  And now that I'm able to travel again, I see that every time I go.
*  Do you still read fiction from Latin America?
*  To be honest with you, the truth is not as much as I should and not as much as I used
*  to. I maybe some of that is age and some of it is also the need to try to keep up with
*  a extremely varied region of almost 600 million people from New York.
*  I mean, look, I'm in Latin America all the time.
*  I travel several weeks a week.
*  I travel all the time.
*  I travel several weeks, months out of the year.
*  But that challenge of trying to keep a finger on the pulse means that unfortunately, I have
*  not read books like Torto Arado, which is winning all kinds of that's a Brazilian book.
*  It is winning all kinds of prizes on international circuits right now.
*  Most of your time you spend writing, editing, commissioning articles, assuming you're not
*  in Latin America. What is your day?
*  I still have the habits of a old wire reporter, Tyler.
*  I'm 46 years old, but I started my career very young in Argentina.
*  I was 22 years old.
*  My first job was covering the economic collapse of Argentina in 2001 and 2002.
*  That was a period that saw five presidents in two weeks, a default on the sovereign debt, a 70%
*  currency devaluation.
*  It was a baptism by fire and it was really what showed me the importance of politics and
*  of policy.
*  And in some respects, that experience has never left me.
*  Something else that has not left me is that need to begin my day by obsessively reading
*  newspapers in Argentina, in Brazil, Colombia, Chile.
*  Those are the countries that I follow most closely.
*  It's impossible to follow all of them.
*  And then I make my way to my work.
*  And then I make my way to my work next to the miserable looking commuters who I mentioned
*  earlier. And we sit here in our office here on Park Avenue and do our best to try to make
*  sense of what's happening in this region and focus not only on the challenges, but talk
*  about some of the successes as well.
*  What's the hardest thing to teach your writers?
*  Humility.
*  Circumstances have changed so much since I started doing this.
*  I have to say with a certain degree of embarrassment that is partly a function of what's
*  happened in world history over the last 25 years since I started doing this.
*  Anglo-American correspondents in Latin America 25 years ago wrote with this certitude, this
*  certainty that these countries needed to learn from the example of the United States
*  and or England. I worked for Reuters for many years and not everybody was like that, of
*  course. But that was a kind of prevailing view.
*  And keep in mind, we were coming out of the 1990s, which was the peak of the post-Cold
*  War period and the end of history and Washington consensus and everything like that.
*  But everything that's happened over the last several years, from the Great Recession of
*  2008 to things like the Iraq War, the problems that the US has had in our own democracy in
*  that time, have really, I think, impacted the way that journalists everywhere write
*  about everything, I would hope, but specifically Latin America, which used to be treated,
*  and you still see shades of it every now and then, with a kind of finger wagging paternalism
*  that not only turns people off in the region, there's no quicker way to shut Latin American
*  readers off than when they sense that happening. But it's also, I think it's important for
*  us to know that, recognize that all of our countries are imperfect and facing some of
*  the same challenges in terms of democratic erosion, rising inequality, addiction to drugs
*  and all the effects that that has on organized crime.
*  We're much less different from people in this part of the world than many of us believed
*  20, 25 years ago.
*  Speaking of humility, is Malay going to succeed or fail?
*  I wish I knew, Tyler. He's such a fascinating story. And, you know, I think that Javier
*  Millet has the right ideas. He understands that the essence of Argentina's problem is
*  fiscal, that it's a country that spends more than it earns. It has for decades, and it's
*  part of this whole story of decline, where, you know, it's a country that where the accounts
*  are always a little bit out of balance, or sometimes a lot out of balance. It has over
*  the years financed that gap through one of two mechanisms, either by borrowing.
*  But then when the sources of financing run out, as they periodically do, they print money.
*  And that's the reason that they have one of the world's highest inflation rates right now,
*  upward of 270%. So, you know, Millet understands the nature of the problem. I think his diagnosis
*  is correct. Most mainstream economists agree with that. The problem is, there's several
*  problems. One of them is to bring things back into balance under democracy is something
*  that only a few countries have been able to do.
*  Brazil has done it, right?
*  Brazil has done it. Brazil passed the Real Plan back in the 1990s under democracy, and they managed
*  to bring inflation under control. But you look at the economic stabilization programs elsewhere in
*  Latin America, the one that Mexico had in the 80s and 90s. Of course, that was still during the
*  period of one party rule in Mexico. It was not exactly, it was not a dictatorship, but it was
*  certainly not a democracy. And then the stabilization program that we saw in Chile
*  in the 1980s, the first part of that happened under dictatorship, Augusto Pinochet. The second
*  part happened under democracy in the 1990s. Peru, similarly, Fujimori closed the Congress
*  in the 90s. Anyway, Argentina has to, Argentina democracy is very strong. And so Millet has to
*  operate within that system. That's a good thing. Can he do it? Does he have the temperament
*  to do it? Does he have the political support? These are questions that all of us, including 45
*  million Argentines, are asking ourselves every day. And it's in many ways unprecedented.
*  And I'm rooting for Argentina, because there would be nothing better and more gratifying for me,
*  given what I lived through 25 years ago, than to see that country succeed.
*  Why do Chileans use so many bad dairy sauces on their seafood?
*  Surely this has occurred to you.
*  You know what, really, what I admire about the Chileans is how they put guacamole on everything.
*  I'm trying to think the dairy sauces on the seafood. Explain.
*  So often I'll be in a Chilean city, I'll go to a nice restaurant. It's never what I order,
*  but there'll be some amazing fish dish where the quality of the natural ingredients is high.
*  And there'll be some kind of cream based dairy sauce on it, which ruins it. Now you can order
*  something else. I like the food in Chile quite a bit. Often the Peruvian restaurants, say in
*  Santiago, are though better than the Chilean restaurants. Or you might get something like
*  rodonto in the town market, just because it's different and there's not going to be a dairy
*  sauce on it. I think, Tyler, what we need to do is go on a culinary tour. I will order for you
*  and make sure you don't get any of that damn sauce on your sea bass. How's that?
*  That's very good. A lot of the best food I've had in Chile will just be like avocado or strawberries
*  or the eggs are amazing. It's the best mashed potatoes I've eaten anywhere. But there are just
*  these odd mistakes that appear random, but they're also systematic.
*  Well, Argentina might be the place for you because they are just
*  averse. This has evolved a little bit over the years, but they're so averse to sauce and
*  specifically spice. I had Argentine friends when I lived there who believed that ranch dressing
*  was too spicy. And they have a point. They say, why would you want to take away the actual taste
*  of the food? Why is there so much more gnocchi in Argentina than say anywhere in Italy? Why is it
*  gnocchi that's been transferred? There's a long tradition around gnocchi, which is that people
*  ate it on the 29th of the month. I think that's right. Traditionally, in part because of this
*  history of inflation, it was hard. By the time you got to the end of the month, you didn't have much
*  money left to feed yourself or your family. And so on that day of the month, you went out and
*  bought gnocchi. And that term is also used, gnocchi, to describe people who are on government
*  payrolls, but don't actually do anything. And they're called that because the only day of the
*  month that they show up to be on the job is at the end of the month when they're going to get paid.
*  Little stories like that that tell you a little bit about the political and gastronomical
*  culture of a place. Very last question. Where in Latin America do you wish to explore and learn
*  about next? I, Tyler, there is a omission for me, which is indigenous culture. I have, and it's
*  partly a function of the places where I've lived, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo. These are not Mexico City,
*  even. This is a little bit different. But these are cities that, especially the first two,
*  that are not deeply in touch with indigenous culture. And we are learning so much, even today,
*  about the wealth and intellectual depth of some of these civilizations that lived in the Amazon.
*  There was this longstanding view that Brazil, in particular, was empty when the Portuguese landed
*  there in 1500. And yes, there were some indigenous people, but it was not like the civilizations that
*  the Spanish found in Peru and Mexico, the Incas, the Aztecs, the Mayas, that there was no real
*  equivalent in Brazil. And we're now finding out that that was not the case, that there were perhaps
*  as many as six million people at the time of conquest in the Amazon. And so that, for me,
*  in a region that has so much depth, so many different cultural strands that you can tap into,
*  that is one that is obvious in some ways, but that I'm stimulated and excited by the fact that we
*  continue to discover new things. Brian Winter, thank you very much. Thank you, Tyler. It's been a real pleasure.
