# Dani Rodrik on Why the World is Second Best, at Best  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [October 01, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M17H2dZixEI)
*  Not long ago, a journalist called me up and asked me,
*  whose papers do you look forward to reading more than any others?
*  And my answer, without really hesitating, was Danny Rodrik.
*  So he's our guest today.
*  He's arguably the world's leading and most important economist
*  on trade, globalization, industrial policy,
*  and lately, the prerequisites for liberal democracy.
*  His new book, which I'll mention again, Economics Rules,
*  that's spelled R-U-L-E-S. Why should I not read my own blurb?
*  Quote, the best economists make the best methodologists,
*  and Danny Rodrik is both.
*  His Economics Rules is the single best source
*  for explaining the strengths and weaknesses of economics
*  to an outside audience.
*  So we're going to start this conversation with some questions
*  about some of your recent papers on this topic
*  of premature deindustrialization.
*  I find this one of the most interesting themes in your work.
*  The notion that a mix of automation and competitive trade
*  with wealthier nations might mean that poorer nations today
*  will not be able to industrialize and follow
*  the path of South Korea or Taiwan or Singapore.
*  Now, if this is the case, if a lot of economies out there
*  are deindustrializing prematurely before they've built up
*  a significant middle class, what do you
*  see happening, for instance, for the future of Africa?
*  The parts of Africa which do relatively well,
*  but let's say they do not industrialize,
*  what does that future look like in your vision?
*  I don't think it means that there is a very bleak future
*  for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
*  I just think that it's going to be very difficult, if not
*  impossible, for them to replicate
*  the very rapid convergence experience of the East
*  and Southeast Asian countries.
*  So if you look throughout economic history,
*  the countries that have made that very rapid leap
*  into middle income and beyond that advanced country status,
*  starting from the non-Western countries first, Japan,
*  from the late 19th century onward,
*  and then after the Second World War, South Korea, Taiwan,
*  and then eventually, of course, China,
*  along with a number of countries that
*  did more or less the same in the periphery of Western Europe,
*  closer to Western Europe, the one thing that's common in all
*  of them is very rapid industrialization.
*  And with very rapid industrialization,
*  you can get growth rates on a per capita basis of 4% or 5%
*  per year on an ongoing basis for decade after decade.
*  And that's what's made South Korea what it is today
*  in that kind of rapid growth.
*  But that's a very, if you will, a very exceptional kind
*  of experience.
*  I think if the possibilities of rapid industrialization
*  are no longer there, as you suggest, I think,
*  are in fact no longer there, what we're going to get
*  is slower growth, what I call growth
*  that's based much more on the steady and hard work
*  of accumulating basic capabilities, human capital,
*  skills, institutional improvement,
*  all of those things that are required for the long run,
*  but don't produce the kind of 4%, 5% growth
*  on a per annum basis, as we've seen in those rapid growth
*  countries.
*  But say, let's think of it from a political economy
*  point of view.
*  So South Korea has done very well exporting.
*  And that created for them a set of interest groups
*  which were willing to fund that infrastructure,
*  bring the whole country together, so to speak.
*  You end up with a middle class being built rapidly.
*  That middle class is the foundation for a democracy.
*  And the special interest groups behind the infrastructure,
*  it's clear who they are.
*  And they win almost every political battle.
*  Even without a democracy, you see
*  some version of the same in China.
*  So the countries that don't industrialize,
*  could you imagine them having an ongoing kind
*  of ramshackle existence, where consumer goods
*  flood in at cheap prices?
*  They grow at 4% instead of 10%.
*  But Lagos, in a way, always looks a bit like current Lagos
*  and never looks like Seoul, South Korea.
*  And what's even in developed country,
*  maybe in some fundamental psychological sense changes?
*  Yeah, I think what matters here is probably
*  less the quantitative side, how rapidly you're growing,
*  but sort of the qualitative things that are happening
*  during the growth process.
*  You have to bear in mind that our archetypal,
*  successful industrialization growth,
*  liberal democracy kind of countries, in fact,
*  never experienced the kind of growth rate
*  that Japan and South Korea or China did.
*  In the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution,
*  the Great Britain was growing at rates
*  that we would scoff at today for any emerging market.
*  So it wasn't the growth itself that
*  enabled the development of a middle class
*  and the emergence of and the spread of liberal values
*  and the creation of a liberal democracy,
*  but the kind of the transformation of the economy
*  and its social structure in a particular kind of a way,
*  if you will, the spread of bourgeois liberal values,
*  the restraints placed on the state
*  in terms of how much it could do
*  and under what kind of circumstances.
*  And you're right that in countries like Nigeria
*  and many others which have had very rapid population growth
*  where the urban areas have swollen with people
*  from the countryside, I think sort of managing
*  these kinds of tensions, especially when you're in a sort
*  of open economy and the markets are being flooded
*  by cheap consumer goods from elsewhere,
*  managing these transitions are very difficult,
*  especially since these countries
*  and Africa of course, particularly so,
*  are torn apart by a number of additional cleavages
*  of ethnic language, regional, tribal and so forth.
*  And so those are all things that are making it
*  very, very difficult for these countries.
*  I'm not so sure that rapid growth would necessarily
*  have eliminated these kinds of problems.
*  In some ways it might even aggravate them.
*  Think for example that the Arab Spring,
*  the kind of troubles and the riots
*  that started the Arab Spring
*  arose not in those parts of the Arab world
*  which had had the least amount of development,
*  but in fact in those countries like Tunisia and Egypt,
*  which had had the most rapid development.
*  And it wasn't just GDP growth per se,
*  Tunisia was always an exemplar of improvements
*  in human and social development.
*  Civil society.
*  Civil society, improvements in health,
*  improvements in education, of course,
*  it was an authoritarian regime,
*  but you had the UN development program,
*  the World Bank sort of touting the Tunisian example
*  in the Middle East as an Arab country
*  that had done very well.
*  So we think it's less the rate of growth
*  and then sort of what is happening underneath that
*  in terms of the overall structure.
*  And there you have many, many different paths
*  that are possible.
*  So I really believe in sort of one of my favorite economists
*  is Albert Hirschman.
*  And for a while, two years I occupied the chair
*  was named after him at the Institute for Advanced Study.
*  And he coined the term sort of of possibleism,
*  which was the notion that as much as in social science,
*  you think you wanna generate theories
*  that have deterministic theories of,
*  sort of, you have the industrialization
*  and then the urbanization and then a bourgeoisie
*  and that's going to generate capitalist democracy
*  and so forth.
*  A lot of what happens is just sort of maneuvering
*  around the kind of constraints that geography
*  and history have bequeathed and doing things
*  that otherwise might not have seen possible.
*  But that's, you know, if 50% is driven by sort of
*  exogenous conditions, 50% is still basically in your hands
*  is one way of looking at it.
*  So I always look for sort of things in how you can sort of
*  manipulate and maneuver the context in which
*  you find yourself in.
*  And I think those possibilities always exist.
*  Let me try to pin down a fundamental aspect of your thought
*  that I see running through a lot of different papers.
*  And that's the idea that there's something special
*  about manufacturing.
*  So as I understand you, if you do industrial policy
*  and you get the right kind of manufacturing,
*  it puts you on a better path.
*  Your papers on productivity conversions.
*  Once you're started in manufacturing,
*  according to your data, you get bigger ongoing gains
*  than you do in agriculture.
*  Catch up in agriculture is especially slow.
*  Now I find this intuitively plausible,
*  but if we try to ask at the most foundationalist level,
*  what is it exactly that's the difference between agriculture
*  and manufacturing, which accounts for this?
*  What are the micro foundations of where that comes from?
*  I think, you know, a couple of things.
*  One is that, you know, manufacturing technology
*  is much more easily transportable
*  across international borders.
*  So it's much easier to adopt and adapt
*  manufacturing technology.
*  You can take a, you know, sort of a textile and clothing plant
*  and sort of, you still have to tinker it with it,
*  but it's much easier to transplant.
*  Unlike many agricultural technologies,
*  so we've seen that, for example,
*  in the case of the green revolution,
*  it required a lot of underground adaptation
*  because the weather and soil conditions
*  can be very different.
*  So if you will, the non-traded component
*  of that technology transfer is much greater in agriculture.
*  And for that matter, it's also in services.
*  So, you know, you can figure out how to run a hospital system
*  or education system in an advanced country.
*  You're never going to be able to just take that
*  and transplant it in a developed country,
*  in developing country, because, you know,
*  technically speaking, the non-traded component
*  of that technology is, or the latent adapt,
*  you know, part of the technology that requires adaptation
*  to local content.
*  So it's about the people and the culture?
*  No, I wouldn't say it's the, you know,
*  in the case of agriculture, it's the soil and the weather.
*  So it's not, I'm not saying, I don't want to say that,
*  you know, some people are lazy and therefore, you know,
*  they're culturally not predisposed to this.
*  I'm just saying-
*  But that we see it in services suggests the weather
*  and soil may be part of it, but they can't be driving it.
*  Well, what I'm saying is, no, no, in services,
*  I'm saying a lot of services have been very difficult
*  to transplant.
*  For example, mobile telephony has been very easy.
*  So that's just sort of stands out as one area.
*  But, you know, most of services are basically,
*  you know, think about, you know,
*  figuring out how to do education and health-
*  Or good healthcare systems.
*  Exactly.
*  So that seems to make it culture.
*  If you want to talk about culture,
*  let's sort of open up a big, you know,
*  sort of parentheses and get into that,
*  because I don't know exactly sort of where, you know,
*  institutions and organizations and incentives
*  move into sort of a domain where we sort of start,
*  you know, saying, you know, calling it culture.
*  You know, sort of culture is back in economics.
*  I still have to be convinced that it's actually,
*  it's adding a significant amount to what we learn.
*  But let me get back to the question about manufacturing.
*  So one thing I said is that, you know,
*  it's much easier to move technology.
*  If you've seen the way that Toyota manufactures cars
*  in Japan or in the United States or in South Africa,
*  it's exact, more or less the same.
*  And so that is possible.
*  The second thing which I think is sort of the micro-economics
*  of why it is that manufacturing is so special
*  is that manufacturing standard, traditional manufacturing,
*  like making cars or garments or toys or wigs,
*  has the feature that you can absorb
*  a lot of very unskilled workers into that.
*  Because, you know, being a production worker,
*  even in an auto factory,
*  and certainly in a footwear factory,
*  doesn't take a whole lot of skill.
*  So that means that you can absorb a lot of people
*  off the countryside in a much more rapid way
*  than you could in a lot of other activities
*  where technology and skill are actually highly complimentary.
*  So I heard once a Chinese entrepreneur
*  sort of tell me that when they were,
*  you know, she was running a footwear factory
*  and she was hiring people from the countryside
*  when the industry was starting.
*  And basically the only skill that was required
*  to get that thing was going was not whether they could,
*  you know, read, not whether they were enumerate,
*  but basically whether they could just do this
*  with their hands.
*  So if, you know, basic eyes, you know, sort of, you know,
*  hand coordination is all the skill that was required.
*  And you could, you know, put thousands of people
*  into these factories.
*  So the fact that you can absorb a lot of people,
*  you can increase their productivity three-fold, four-fold
*  off the farm by putting them in these factories
*  is an opportunity that very few other economic sectors
*  provide.
*  And the third, and I'll just mention a third thing,
*  which is very important in manufacturing is tradable.
*  So you don't have to develop a whole industrial complex.
*  You can import the inputs and then export the outputs.
*  So you don't require domestic demand to take off.
*  So you don't require an economy wide productivity revolution
*  in order to have consumers to whom you can sell your output.
*  You can simply sell it on world markets.
*  What that means is that it's enough to develop mastery
*  in one segment of manufacturing at a time.
*  And that provides the kind of engine that you need.
*  Compare that with the kind of transformation you need
*  in services where most of the output
*  has to be sold domestically.
*  You need basically everybody's incomes to grow,
*  every sector to experience a productivity increase.
*  So you have a large enough market that you can sell.
*  Otherwise any service sector that is doing really well,
*  eventually is going to experience very rapid terms
*  of trade deterioration domestically.
*  So those things, the transferability of the technology,
*  the fact that it can absorb a lot of unskilled workers
*  traditionally, this is what's changing,
*  off the countryside or out of informality and tradability
*  I think is sort of what makes really manufacturing
*  historically has been made special.
*  A question about industrial policy.
*  Now I think we would agree in a number
*  of the East Asian tigers,
*  industrial policy has worked out pretty well.
*  But take the case now,
*  there's premature deindustrialization
*  going on in many countries.
*  It might be hard to reverse.
*  Richard Baldwin writes of the splitting up of supply chains.
*  So South Korea and Japan had relatively
*  integrated supply chains.
*  Now the supply chains are all around the globe.
*  In a time like this,
*  where manufacturing is changing rapidly
*  and policy itself is subject to a status quo bias,
*  as we know from your own writings,
*  what do you think is the new role for industrial policy,
*  if any, and should we today perhaps not be more skeptical
*  about it than we were say when Singapore started it?
*  I think the answer to your last question is yes.
*  Although I wouldn't say we should be more skeptical,
*  I think we should expect lower return to it,
*  is what I'd like to say,
*  simply because I think the possibilities of,
*  you know, sort of industrialization in the sense
*  that you could put in the old days,
*  30, 35% of your labor force into manufacturing,
*  that is not going to happen.
*  Sub-Saharan Africa will not get there.
*  So what that means is that the returns
*  to even successful industrial policy these days is less.
*  So that has a couple of implications.
*  One is that increasingly I think,
*  maybe we really need a different term.
*  We shouldn't say industrial policy.
*  Maybe we should talk about
*  a structural transformation policy.
*  Your perspective in terms of
*  how do you get rapid transformation,
*  you should move away from a little bit at the margin
*  from manufacturing into other parts of the economy.
*  So I think you should be thinking
*  more about services as well.
*  A lot of services are tradable.
*  So to some extent, some of the advantages might exist
*  in tradable services as well.
*  The other thing which I think a lot of common mistake
*  in industrial policy that low and middle income countries do,
*  which is to look at industrial policy
*  or criteria for success of industrial policy
*  in terms of output exports, innovation,
*  R&D patents and things like that.
*  Whereas I would put a lot more emphasis
*  on actually employment.
*  The question is, are you generating adequate employment
*  in these more productive industries
*  that are oriented into world markets?
*  Because the kind of industrial policy
*  ends up generating profits, investment and R&D
*  in a low to middle income country.
*  But at the same time, employment is shrinking,
*  is not going to be the kind of high return industry
*  for return activity for the economy as a whole.
*  So I think you're basically right
*  that I go around these days a lot less sort of advocating
*  for very forceful industrial policy in large parts
*  because I do think that the returns to it have fallen.
*  And I think also we need to think through a lot more
*  sort of what it should look like in a world
*  where in fact we're concerned at least as much
*  about services as manufacturing,
*  even in the middle income or low income countries.
*  Let me introduce one of your best known ideas.
*  It's sometimes called Roderick's Trilema
*  of the World Economy.
*  Here's how one of my readers defined it.
*  According to this theory, democracy, national sovereignty
*  and global economic integration are mutually incompatible.
*  We can combine any two of the three,
*  but never have all three simultaneously and in full.
*  Given that, which I would agree with,
*  if we take the Eurozone today,
*  something clearly isn't working.
*  I don't mean just Greece,
*  but every now and then we hear of an ascent recovery
*  and the recovery's over before it really
*  has even gotten underway.
*  The Eurozone is now sliding back to deflation.
*  France, Italy seem to be slow growth countries permanently.
*  Let's say it's up to you.
*  Given Roderick's Trilema, what should the Eurozone do?
*  Well, academically it's a very easy to give an answer.
*  I think, and it's what the Trilema suggests
*  that Europe's policymakers should decide
*  whether they want...
*  But they ask you, they were about to decide,
*  Professor Roderick.
*  Please tell us which one to give up.
*  Well, Tyler, as you know, we're very good about laying,
*  our job is to lay out the trade-offs,
*  but not to decide where we want to be on those.
*  But you as a citizen, say you're a European voter.
*  I'll tell you that too.
*  So let me answer the first question.
*  The first question is, I as somebody who cannot put my,
*  if I cannot put myself in the shoes
*  of the European electorate, European citizenry,
*  I say the choice is very clear cut.
*  Either more political integration
*  or less economic integration.
*  So that's the choice that the,
*  assuming that we don't wanna give up on democracy.
*  If we wanna sort of subject to the constraint
*  that we want Europe to remain or regain
*  as thriving democracy, then this is the inescapable choice
*  that the trial am appoints to.
*  Which is to say you have to decide
*  that whether you're going to politically integrate,
*  and if you're not going to politically integrate,
*  you have to figure out a way of economically beginning
*  at least some of this integration.
*  And that means losing the monetary integration
*  in particular.
*  Now you ask me which would be my preference.
*  My preference certainly would have been before this crisis
*  or well into the crisis, a year or two into the crisis
*  would have been this is the opportunity
*  where you just basically sort of go to your electorates
*  and say this is why we need to federalize Europe.
*  This is why we need to politically integrate.
*  This is why we need not just banking integration,
*  but we also need significant amount of fiscal integration
*  and the creation of pan-European political space.
*  So that's your first choice.
*  Is full steam ahead with integration.
*  Full steam ahead with political integration
*  to back up the significant amount of economic integration
*  that already exists.
*  But now you've seen three or four more years.
*  We know one of Roderick's principles
*  is economics is almost always about the second,
*  third or 17th best.
*  And what do you choose today?
*  I'm afraid, and I say this very, very reluctantly
*  that I do think that for a number of countries at least
*  that a loosening of the restraints
*  of monetary integration of a common currency.
*  So you'd create a graceful path out of the Euro.
*  Well, of course that's the difficulty
*  because it's very difficult to figure out what that grace,
*  if in fact that graceful path exists.
*  But yes, sort of laying that aside,
*  those transitional costs aside,
*  I think at this point, I just do not see the kind of,
*  European integration was always an elite project.
*  European integration was never something
*  that the people demanded.
*  And then, leaders said, okay, we will do whatever you ask.
*  But it was always an elite project
*  when the governmental leaders sold to their population,
*  to their electorate.
*  I think what happened with the Euro crisis
*  is that somebody like Merkel, instead of going out
*  and saying, look, this is not a crisis of sort of,
*  it's not a moral issue that here you have a profligate
*  country that we need to sort of discipline,
*  but this is really a crisis of interdependence.
*  That it was as much as a German problem
*  or German banks that are the source of the problem
*  as the Greeks who borrowed or the Spaniards who borrowed.
*  That line was never put forth to the German population.
*  It was always became sort of the moralistic narrative
*  of the North versus South.
*  And I think that's sort of,
*  that's where the political elite failed in Europe.
*  And I think with that, it's very difficult to see now
*  how you're going to undo that in Europe, unfortunately.
*  So let's say you're China, you're on the ruling council.
*  They haven't even discarded democracy yet.
*  So maybe they're sitting in Roderick's by-lemma
*  or dilemma, whatever it would be called.
*  And they're trying to maintain capital controls,
*  but there's more phony invoicing all the time,
*  exports running through Hong Kong, a lot of chicanery,
*  people trading money out through Bitcoin,
*  a lot of leakage.
*  In the last few months, they've spent three or 400 billion
*  of reserves, it's real money, trying to keep the value
*  of their currency up, it still doesn't seem to be working.
*  In the past, you've argued eloquently,
*  capital controls often make a good deal of sense.
*  Their capital controls now, should they double down
*  and defend the value of the yuan at all costs,
*  or should they let it go, open up the capital account,
*  and see what the new value of the currency will be?
*  I don't think this is-
*  You're in charge.
*  Yeah, no, I would not do anything hasty
*  on the capital controls front at all.
*  I don't think that the Chinese have mismanaged this
*  as badly as often it is described
*  in the financial press.
*  I agree with that.
*  And I think that there was a run-up in the stock market,
*  and they did a bunch of things to try to prop the bubble up.
*  And eventually they did, and maybe it went a little bit
*  too far, but they did more or less the right things
*  in this whole process, and they've allowed the currency
*  in the last few years to move more freely.
*  So I think they're true to their policy roots,
*  which have paid off very handsomely
*  over the last three decades.
*  I mean, I think the last thing that we outsiders should do
*  is second guess the wisdom of Chinese economic policymaking.
*  We're talking about the country that has engineered
*  the history's most miraculous poverty reduction program ever.
*  Let's say another $300 billion of reserves
*  go out the door to keep the peg.
*  Your phone rings in Cambridge and you're asked-
*  You're starting from $300 billion.
*  It's nothing, it's just a drop in the bucket.
*  Why did they accumulate those reserves to begin with?
*  So obviously, yeah, I mean, it's not like
*  they're running out of reserves, it is not the issue.
*  And if they weren't losing some reserves,
*  I mean, that's part of the optimal adjustment.
*  I mean, it's not, you know, so I'm not, you know,
*  I don't see any reason.
*  I think there is, you know, if you ask me,
*  sort of, you know, tell me why I should be worried
*  about China, I can give you real reasons
*  why I should be worrying about China,
*  relating to the fact that they, in fact,
*  have both a huge political transformation ahead of them,
*  as well as a huge economic transformation.
*  The political transformation being the one
*  of having to open up eventually, become more democratic,
*  and we have no idea how they will manage that.
*  The economic transformation, which they have not
*  really gotten, you know, underway seriously,
*  they've started, but it's really there at the very beginning,
*  is how to turn into more of a domestically
*  consumer-oriented, you know, sort of less investing,
*  more consuming kind of economy,
*  and less dependent on the world market.
*  Those are hugely challenging problems.
*  Managing, you know, sort of the currency right now,
*  the financial, sort of, you know, there's the stock market,
*  which is a tiny, tiny part of the Chinese economy.
*  You know, it's, you know, it pales, I think,
*  in comparison to those bigger issues.
*  Let's take Milton Friedman's dilemma,
*  which is, in a way, an early version of Roderick's trilemma.
*  So Friedman argued there was a natural tension
*  between high levels of immigration and the welfare state.
*  And you see this quite sharply now in Western Europe.
*  In some ways, you see it in the United States,
*  even though our immigration has not been up lately,
*  but the tension is there.
*  So if politically it turned out that you had to choose,
*  you know, at the margin, cutting back immigration
*  or cutting back the welfare state, you as a citizen,
*  the economist cannot say.
*  But what are your thoughts on that?
*  Well, I would, you know, I start from the supposition
*  that borders matter.
*  Borders have moral significance.
*  So I find, so I accept the notion that, let's say,
*  we as a democracy or citizens don't,
*  won't necessarily put the same weight on somebody
*  on the other side of the border as they do somebody
*  who's their neighbor or share the same political system.
*  So you can, if you choose to.
*  Well, I can, if I choose to.
*  So the question I ask myself is this.
*  Let's suppose that the trade-offs are,
*  let's suppose, as you've put it, which is that I can bring,
*  we can allow some people to come in,
*  and those who are coming in are going to be better off,
*  potentially at the cost of some
*  of my own co-nationals being worse off.
*  My answer is that at the margin,
*  this is a relatively easy question to answer,
*  because I say, okay, how much weight would I have to place
*  on somebody on the other side of the border
*  relative to somebody on my side of the border
*  for me not to let that person in?
*  And if you do the calculation, which I've done recently,
*  which is to say, sort of, let me just be careful,
*  let me be clear about what I'm saying.
*  I'm asking the question, under what kind of weighting
*  of outsiders would it be a bad idea for me not
*  to let some more people to come in?
*  And the answer is that I would have to put a weight
*  of less than one-fifth of somebody
*  on the other side of the border compared to somebody here.
*  And then I say, look, you know, I might understand
*  that it's reasonable to say, okay, you know, it's,
*  maybe I care twice as much as somebody who's my neighbor,
*  as somebody who's not, but five times as much?
*  I'm not so sure.
*  So that seems like excessive.
*  So given how restrictive and how high these barriers are
*  at the moment, at the margin, to me,
*  it's a relatively easy answer, which is to say, yes,
*  at this point it makes sense for rich countries to take
*  in more people from the poor countries.
*  And to put it in a somewhat sort of, to draw an analogy
*  between the trade regime, what has happened in terms
*  of trade liberalization and the migration regime.
*  The migration regime today is more or less
*  where the trade regime was back in the 1950s.
*  And back in the 1950s, you know, sort of the global gains
*  from further liberalizing of trade relative to, you know,
*  sort of the income distributional costs within countries
*  and so forth was relatively huge.
*  And I think the migration regime is somehow, you know,
*  sort of back there and we need to sort of, you know,
*  rationalize it and liberalize it a little bit more.
*  I'm evading the tougher question, of course,
*  which is, you know, where would you stop?
*  So it's easy for me to answer at this point, you know,
*  the regulations are too restrictive,
*  but where would you actually stop?
*  I would definitely, I would certainly stop at a point
*  where the integrity of public institutions
*  and the welfare systems of the advanced countries
*  would be seriously threatened.
*  But I don't know where that is.
*  I would say today, Germans are relatively cosmopolitan people
*  on the world stage.
*  How well will the absorption of 800,000 plus Syrians
*  go in Germany?
*  What is your opinion?
*  Well, I mean, I think they have absorbed more Turks
*  over the sort of the 1960s and 1970s.
*  And look at the German national team.
*  If you grade that on a scale of eight to F.
*  How well has it gone in your view,
*  Turkish absorption into Germany?
*  From the, I mean, I think it's gone actually remarkably well
*  and there's certainly some lessons
*  that could be drawn from that.
*  I don't know anybody who would sort of would say
*  that this has been a terrible mistake for Germany.
*  I think they've certainly have enriched.
*  I mean, leaving it aside their economic contribution,
*  they've enriched German life.
*  So I think that's the most direct comparison and analog
*  is what happened with the Turkish inflow
*  of the 60s and 70s.
*  And that was huge.
*  I don't remember off-handed what the numbers are,
*  but certainly it was huge and it's worked quite well.
*  Now you were born in Turkey, you grew up in Turkey.
*  I have so many questions about Turkey to ask you,
*  but let me just try two or three.
*  Let's take the Turkish city of Konya.
*  I've been to Konya.
*  Outsiders sometimes call Konya the Bible belt of Turkey.
*  I'm not sure that's a good comparison,
*  but it's a more religious city than Istanbul.
*  It's a kind of heartland city in Turkey.
*  And just the simple question, I would put it this way.
*  Do you trust the median voter in Konya?
*  So if you think about Turkey's troubles,
*  if Turkey were truly ruled by the median voter in Konya,
*  to what extent would things be fine
*  or to what extent is the problem
*  it's not really democratic enough?
*  Do you see what I'm asking?
*  Because in some obvious ways,
*  the current regime is not very democratic,
*  even though there are elections of a sort.
*  But do you trust the median voter in Konya?
*  I do trust the median voter in Konya
*  as I would trust the median voter in any country.
*  However, I think when you think about democracy,
*  it's not just about the median voter.
*  I think, and this is why I'm working on this topic
*  on the question of liberal democracy,
*  it's that the things about democracy
*  that we really care about are just twofold.
*  One is that we want the median voter's views to be reflected.
*  The second is we don't want to allow the median voter
*  to do whatever he or she wants
*  to the rest of the population.
*  And that's why I think the constraints that liberalism
*  or the liberal institutions, the rule of law,
*  constraints of non-discrimination,
*  of minorities, of ideological or ethnic or religious sort,
*  those are equally important parts
*  of well-functioning democracies.
*  And one thing that has happened in countries like Turkey,
*  which is actually a very widespread phenomenon
*  around the world is as the franchise and elections
*  have spread around the world,
*  by the count of the polity,
*  which is this group that keeps track of this,
*  we have now more democracies than autocracies in the world,
*  but they're all electoral democracies.
*  They're democracies precisely in the sense that you meant,
*  which is that you have elections regularly
*  and they're generally free and fair.
*  But what they do, however, is that they allow the winners
*  of those elections to more or less freely tamper,
*  tamper on the rights of those who are not part
*  of that winning majority.
*  So the liberal element of that democracy
*  is really what's missing.
*  So I'm all for empowering the median voter
*  in Turkey or elsewhere,
*  but all in the context of rules and practices
*  that ensure equal treatment of minorities of all kind.
*  And that's really the part that I think, for example,
*  the whole political economy literature on democracy
*  has missed out on because it's essentially,
*  it's just sort of thinking about it
*  in terms of elections and the median voter,
*  not thinking about it in terms of these restraints
*  on what the median voter can do.
*  So thinking in terms of minorities,
*  if we go to the Eastern Mediterranean in times past,
*  today's Izmir was once Smyrna.
*  It was a fantastically cosmopolitan city.
*  Greeks, Armenians, people from all over the Middle East,
*  Westerners lived there.
*  It was for quite a while in harmony.
*  The earlier Ottoman Empire was quite a cosmopolitan place
*  in many parts.
*  Again, by its time, fair degree of harmony.
*  And in the early part of the 20th century,
*  that changes very fundamentally.
*  You have some very violent events and it's never gone back.
*  Do you think it's possible for the Eastern Mediterranean
*  to be an area where these civil minorities have protection?
*  Or do you think the more monoglot version,
*  sort of Turks plus Kurds, now plus refugees,
*  is simply what we're gonna have?
*  How do you think about that whole change?
*  A great, terrible, unfortunate development
*  or somehow it's a bit like the European 17th century,
*  great human tragedy, but a clearing out
*  that enabled nation states to in some way move forward.
*  The big change of course was nationalism
*  and the creation of the nation state.
*  I don't think that the old order
*  was a particularly desirable one.
*  It is one that of course significantly circumscribed
*  what the Greeks or the Armenians or the Jews
*  or the other minorities were allowed to do
*  in these multinational empires.
*  So it's not like this wonderful ancien regime
*  that we can't resuscitate.
*  And of course the forces of nationalism
*  and the creation of the nation state
*  moved us into this new world
*  where I think what happened in the Eastern Mediterranean
*  as in so many other parts of the world
*  was that you had the mobilization of the masses
*  under sort of a nationalist rubric
*  relatively early in terms of historical development
*  compared to Western European countries.
*  For example, in Western Europe you had
*  liberal ideas developed before the franchise
*  became a mass franchise.
*  So in fact in Britain and Western Europe
*  the liberals didn't want liberalism existed
*  before democracy came into being.
*  Whereas of course in the Eastern Mediterranean
*  places like Turkey we're trying to create liberalism
*  after you had a nationalist mobilization
*  and the creation of democratic like regimes
*  based on the mass franchise.
*  And that's sort of, it's harder to bring those ideas
*  of tolerance, the separation of powers,
*  the rule of law and so forth relatively later in the game.
*  And that's what's happening.
*  But it is not impossible.
*  One of the places that I'd like to talk about,
*  in fact talk about this in my latest paper
*  on liberal democracy is the case of Lebanon
*  in the Eastern Mediterranean.
*  Lebanon until 1975 was a fascinating example of,
*  it wasn't exactly liberal democracy
*  because it was sort of based on these different groups.
*  They each had their shares in power
*  and then constitutionally they were each allocated.
*  It was five seats at that.
*  But it was, the political scientists writing about Lebanon
*  in the 60s and 70s talked about it as a liberal democracy.
*  The reason was because you had so many different groups,
*  so many cross-cutting cleavages.
*  You had the Muslims and Christians,
*  the Christians were between the Greek Orthodox
*  and the Muslims between the Shi'i and the Sunni.
*  So there were so many of these cross-cutting cleavages
*  that they essentially had reached a modus operandi
*  that no individual group had this notion
*  that if simply they could prevail,
*  then they could rule forever.
*  And when you don't have that expectation,
*  then you work out bargains with alternatives
*  because you're afraid of what the other side
*  is going to do to you when they come to power
*  if they have a chance of doing that.
*  And of course, how that system came to an end
*  is also interesting because once you had the massive influx
*  of Palestinian refugees from Jordan,
*  that balance was upset.
*  So you now have one group that can potentially
*  see itself as having a majority
*  for an indefinite period of time.
*  So no longer has to essentially keep on
*  with that basic compromise.
*  And that's how the Lebanese associational system
*  came to an end after 1975 with the Civil War.
*  But at least that gives you an idea of the possibilities.
*  I don't think this is cultural.
*  I don't think this has anything to do necessarily with Islam.
*  It's not in the water.
*  These things can happen.
*  But you need this experience of learning to compromise
*  and to think that you need to be moderate in your policies
*  because it might be that some other group will rule after you
*  so that you have this, if you will,
*  these repeated game incentives to basically not discriminate
*  against those not in power very much.
*  And I can certainly come up with scenarios for Turkey
*  where this might have developed over time.
*  And I would have to blame a successive mistakes
*  made by political leaderships at different times
*  as to why this process has so often been short-circuited.
*  First, of course, the military by intervening repeatedly
*  and therefore short-circuiting this process of building up
*  these habits of regular change in power
*  and therefore moderation and compromise developing.
*  And of course, these days with the government of Erdogan,
*  who basically has just chosen the tactic that do anything
*  to remain in power, including aggravate
*  all the cleavages on the basis of sect,
*  on the basis of nationality, and so forth.
*  So what then is the equilibrium with the Kurds?
*  They're scattered across several nations.
*  It's a burning issue in Turkey.
*  Even within Kurdish circles, there
*  are multiple languages and different points of view.
*  Do you see that as headed towards something like Lebanon
*  in its more vital, feistier time,
*  or do you see it going very badly wrong?
*  The Kurds, Turkey, and to some extent Kurds and Iraq,
*  will there be a Kurdish state?
*  And is there any equilibrium at all?
*  I think it's very unlikely that there
*  will be redrawing of the borders formally.
*  I see that as a very remote possibility.
*  I think there was a possibility that the Turkish government
*  would have reached a more civil vendi with the Kurds
*  and some kind of resolution in the same way
*  that the Basque problem in Spain was resolved.
*  Is that resolved?
*  They're not asking for independence.
*  I mean, there's not terrorism in the streets every day.
*  So I think in that way, I think in that sense,
*  it's been resolved.
*  Whereas the problem with the Kurdish problem right now
*  in Turkey is terrible.
*  I mean, violence has flared up again, and so forth.
*  We're back to some of the worst kind of conflict.
*  But I don't think there is something deeply structural
*  that prevents the kind of compromise.
*  I think the Kurdish nationalists, or in Turkey
*  at least, are very clear sighted in understanding
*  that full independence is neither in their interest
*  nor something that they're likely to get.
*  And the kinds of things that they do want realistically
*  are not things that the Turkish national government could not
*  give up.
*  So there is no fundamental problem
*  as to why that cannot be resolved if it is not
*  being exploited for political reasons.
*  Right now, for example, what's happening
*  is that Erdogan is exploiting the Kurdish problem
*  as a way of building up his own nationalist base.
*  And that's sort of is being used,
*  because that particular cleavage is being used
*  for political purpose.
*  But one can imagine other political strategies,
*  other winning strategies that would involve compromise.
*  Orhan Pamuk, by far the most famous Turkish author today.
*  Overrated or underrated, what's your take?
*  You know, I have to say I have never
*  been able to finish one of his books.
*  This is not true.
*  There's one that I finished, but this actually
*  wasn't the fiction.
*  It was his memoirs of Istanbul.
*  And I did finish that because he grew up
*  in the part of town which is very close to where I grew up,
*  too, so I could associate.
*  But his novels, I have to say, I find convoluted and sort
*  of going around and around in circles.
*  So I'm not big Orhan Pamuk fan.
*  I love his older brother, by the way,
*  who's an economic historian.
*  He's a very distinguished economic historian.
*  Chef Kett Pamuk, and I finished a lot of his books.
*  So who's your favorite novelist?
*  You know, I love John Le Carre.
*  I think I've read probably every one of his novels.
*  I like Ian McQueen a lot.
*  I'm reading Jonathan Franzen's book, Purity, right now,
*  which I enjoy.
*  I like sort of the Idros you in.
*  If we take Le Carre's vision of how a spy agency works,
*  is that Roderick-esque political economy?
*  Or does it force you to revise your views of politics?
*  No, no, it's very human, right?
*  I mean, it's just the mundane and the small things
*  that happen.
*  So it's a very good way of actually putting it,
*  because there's probably, I had not thought of this
*  until you said it, Tyler.
*  So it's a great point that there is
*  a lot of political economy in John Le Carre's description
*  of how these sort of bureaucracies
*  operate and the personal relationships and so forth.
*  So I have to think about it.
*  But no, I mean, my view of sort of,
*  you know, I've never had the starry-eyed view of how
*  government agencies operate.
*  So it's not one that is jarring with respect
*  to my own worldview.
*  If I think of your work as a whole,
*  I always like to ask this question about thinkers.
*  What's the underlying current which
*  ties a lot of the different parts together?
*  And one thing that struck me going through your work,
*  by the way, this pile is a small fraction of your work.
*  And I feel sorry for my assistant
*  who had to print it all out.
*  But even a lot of your papers that don't mention Turkey
*  at all, I guess personally, I read them as asking the question,
*  why hasn't Turkey become a fully free and modern society?
*  So even if I think of your work on premature
*  deindustrialization, if I think of Turkey in the 19th century,
*  a big theme, from my understanding,
*  is that Turkey is then prematurely industrializing.
*  And that's why the Ottoman Empire
*  becomes the sick man of Europe.
*  So I read a lot of your papers as looking
*  at this elephant from different sides,
*  even if not about Turkey at all.
*  Would you respond to that?
*  Do you think that's a fair characterization?
*  I think that's very perceptive.
*  I mean, I think from my first foray into social science,
*  I mean, I think that has been the question that
*  I've been motivated by.
*  Just to back up a little bit, when
*  I was growing up in Turkey in high school,
*  of course, social science was probably
*  the last thing on my mind, just because of the way
*  that social science is taught in Turkey schools,
*  sort of rote memorization and so forth.
*  That wasn't fun.
*  And like all Turkish kids of my generation,
*  with some academic pretensions, or at least relatively good
*  in school, my goal was to do engineering.
*  So I came to Harvard as an undergraduate
*  to study engineering, only to find out
*  that there's actually no engineering major at Harvard.
*  Not yet.
*  Right.
*  And then I discovered the library and the books,
*  and the fact that they had more books in Turkish, on Turkey,
*  and Turkish history in Widener Library
*  than I could ever possibly find in Turkey.
*  And then I started taking courses
*  in political science and economics,
*  and it just opened up to me what it meant
*  to be thinking about these social, economic,
*  and political questions.
*  But the one thing that motivated me always
*  was this question of why was Turkey relatively poor
*  and not developed, and the rest of the world,
*  and the United States or Western Europe developed.
*  So that is where, given this motivation,
*  let me ask you for the simplest, crudest version of your answer.
*  We all know boiling things down to a sentence
*  is a horrible oversimplification,
*  and you above virtually all other economists
*  are about the complex and the multifaceted.
*  But nonetheless, if you had to give us the super boiled down
*  version of why hasn't Turkey become a more or less fully
*  modernized society, what would it be?
*  Well, let me give you the answer.
*  Give us the super short, and then we'll give you the follow up.
*  I'll give you the general answer to that question,
*  not for Turkey, but for countries like Turkey.
*  And my general sort of question would be 50% structure,
*  50% agency, which is to say, you start
*  with a lot of initial conditions that aren't very favorable.
*  Going back to the 19th century, you
*  start on the wrong end of the global division of labor.
*  Everybody else is industrialized, and you're not.
*  Plus, then the British come, and they open up your trade regime.
*  All the craft industries you have in the 18th century
*  are just decimated because of imports from Britain
*  and other Western Europeans.
*  And then you get defeated in a world war.
*  So you start with very inauspicious circumstances.
*  And then agency, 50%.
*  What happened, for example, under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,
*  who was sort of the leader who took Turkey
*  from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire,
*  erected the Turkish Republic on top of that,
*  he did a lot of very good things and a lot of very silly things.
*  And we're still living with the consequences
*  of many of those things, including the good things.
*  I mean, the fact that Turkey is a relatively secular country
*  with a large middle class, to a large extent,
*  is the result of his top-down, extremely brutal, extremely
*  narrow-minded view of what it meant
*  to be a modern nation state.
*  Basically, take the Swiss Civil Code and the French Criminal
*  Code and just the German commercial code
*  and just apply it.
*  But also, a lot of the problems that we are having
*  are also the residue of the fact that, in that rigid view
*  of how to modernize, he pushed out
*  a lot of the people who need to be included back
*  into the Turkish polity, including
*  the conservatives, the religious conservatives,
*  and a lot of others, and the Kurds.
*  But if I look at Europe as a whole,
*  there seems to be a line somewhere.
*  Maybe it's at Slovenia, Croatia.
*  You can debate where the line is.
*  But east of that line, you don't see full development.
*  And that, at least, suggests to me it's not mostly agency.
*  There's something structural.
*  Because to think the leaders or the citizens
*  in these different countries all made the same mistake,
*  it doesn't quite fit my other views about the world.
*  So if you're comparing eastern and Western Europe, again,
*  this isn't only about Turkey.
*  It's not about Atatürk.
*  You could say the same about most of Eastern Europe,
*  except possibly Poland.
*  What's that fundamental difference between west
*  and east that is giving rise structurally
*  to whatever percent of the explanation
*  you want to assign to structural forces?
*  I would go back to people like Barrington Moore, who
*  tried to explain why is it that Western Europe, Britain
*  developed democratic institutions,
*  and it became very difficult elsewhere in Central Europe
*  to do the same.
*  I think a lot of what he said had
*  to do with the nature of how did market
*  forces and social structures interact.
*  In particular, what was the mode of commercialization
*  of agriculture?
*  So if you started out with peasant agriculture,
*  small scale farms, and landlords that
*  weren't interested in labor repressive agriculture, who
*  diversified into commercial businesses in urban areas.
*  As in Britain, you got a very different kind
*  of path of industrialization and political development,
*  where you got large commercial estates, large landlords,
*  absentee or not, interested in labor repressive methods
*  of farming, who did not diversify to a large extent
*  into industry, into commercial enterprises,
*  allied themselves with the state so
*  as to be able to continue the repression of the agrarian
*  sector.
*  So your three word answer would be structure of agriculture,
*  if we had to boil it down.
*  Yeah, I mean, it has to be agriculture, because that's
*  where everything started.
*  So that's where everybody was.
*  That's where the wealth was.
*  So if you go back to 1780.
*  But not ideology.
*  So you're an economic structuralist.
*  No, this is where, no, this is again, I think, the fact that,
*  let me put it this way.
*  If France was not in Western Europe, but in Eastern Europe,
*  I don't think it would be the kind of democracy
*  or the kind of industrial economy it came to be.
*  I think having the Netherlands in the north and Britain
*  to the west, I think both the competition,
*  the benchmarking and the ideas, I think that sort of made,
*  I think in that way, geography made a difference.
*  But geography, because it sort of enables
*  the transfer of ideas and sort of who are you looking at
*  as sort of what kind of a country you want to be.
*  And so in many ways, France had the initial conditions
*  that would have made it look more
*  like a central or Eastern European country
*  than a Western European one.
*  But the fact that it's part of Western Europe,
*  I think, has to do that it was so much closer to Britain.
*  I think you see the same about why is it
*  that Vietnam has developed in the way
*  that it has after it sort of opened up its economy.
*  I think if Vietnam was located in Latin America or Central
*  America, I don't think it would have been half the miracle
*  that it was.
*  Keep in mind, Vietnam is still poorer
*  than Bolivia, which is the poorest country in South America.
*  So Vietnam has yet to show it's a success.
*  Wouldn't you bet that in 10 years it won't be?
*  No, I wouldn't bet.
*  I would say it's an even money bet.
*  Well, let's go to a short question and answer
*  part of the talk.
*  I'm going to shout something out,
*  ask you whether it's overrated or underrated.
*  You give me a short answer.
*  You're free to pass if you want to.
*  As an economic method, going back to your book,
*  your book, this book, Economic Rules,
*  Randomized Control Trials as an Economic Method,
*  overrated or underrated?
*  Today, overrated.
*  Give us a quick why.
*  That's the only thing that students do these days.
*  And I think that's not the only way we learn.
*  So it's crowding out, I think, a lot of it.
*  I think it was a fantastic contribution
*  to the economics literature.
*  But I think it's sort of the marginal contribution of,
*  I think the way that I think about it
*  is internal validity is not the only thing.
*  So the good thing about all these RCTs
*  is that they're very good about being
*  able to identify causal effects.
*  But they're very poor about saying anything about why
*  is it that we get these effects, or in fact,
*  whether these things also, the same effects
*  would occur in other contexts elsewhere.
*  So it worked here.
*  We don't know if it's going to work somewhere else.
*  And it's crowding out the kind of work that
*  Political economy, because it's hard to do an RCT
*  on political economy.
*  But even in micro things, I mean,
*  I think even in the kinds of things where we have applied
*  RCTs, I think we should be thinking a lot harder
*  conceptually and theoretically.
*  So there was a time when I came out of graduate school,
*  if you were doing development economics
*  and you were doing something empirical,
*  you could never get a job.
*  Because probably in development economics at the time,
*  you couldn't get a job, period.
*  But the point was that doing empirical economics would not
*  make you rise up.
*  And I think that was terrible.
*  And I think we've now basically moved all the way
*  to the other extreme, where empirical work also
*  means just doing something where you put 100% weight
*  on identifying internal validity,
*  but very little thought into issues of external validity
*  or the basic theory.
*  And I think we just have to correct some of that balance.
*  Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet and his Sufi mysticism,
*  as you know, he wrote some in Turkish.
*  Overrated or underrated?
*  Not enough known.
*  Nazim Hikmet, Turkish poet, famous left-wing figure,
*  flirted with the Soviet Union.
*  Fantastic poet.
*  So underrated.
*  Underrated.
*  Underrated.
*  The Iran nuclear deal.
*  Overrated or underrated.
*  I think just right.
*  Just right.
*  The idea of an independent Catalonia.
*  A lot of my friends will hate me for saying this, but overrated.
*  And why?
*  Again, my Catalonian friends are going to hate me for this.
*  But when I ask what is it that they
*  want to get out of independence, it
*  seems that that basically is just very much a sense
*  of having been treated very badly by Madrid.
*  It's almost like a very sort of a 19th century
*  sense of nationalism that is driving it.
*  And I sort of think that we should be beyond that.
*  And I think that in a thriving European Union,
*  hopefully we get there.
*  That basically a lot of regions can do a lot more of things
*  that they can do on their own.
*  And I think the right sort of devolution
*  of political authority is up for grabs.
*  And breaking up Spain, I don't think
*  is going to really help that bigger goal of having
*  politically richer and deeply democratic Europe.
*  So I don't see what the upside really
*  is except for this deep sense of 19th century or something more.
*  What's a country right now investors are underrating
*  and a country they're overrating in today's world,
*  given your understanding?
*  Brazil, I think, is deeply underrated right now.
*  I think that when you look at what's happening,
*  on the one hand, in Brazil, it shocks you
*  that there is this widespread corruption with Petrobras
*  that seems to go all the way up.
*  On the other hand, when you look at how
*  they're dealing with this situation,
*  it's incredibly impressive.
*  It's something that even in an advanced country,
*  you wouldn't think would happen.
*  That you have these prosecutors and judges who are actually
*  following the rule of the law.
*  There's real accountability.
*  Real accountability.
*  This is not being used to settle political scores in the way
*  that it would happen anywhere if it was happening at all.
*  And you know, they have industrial policy.
*  And industrial policy isn't great,
*  but at least they're trying to do something about it.
*  So that's a somewhat separate issue.
*  So I think, to me, when I look at Brazil,
*  they're demonstrating a political maturity in the way
*  that their system operates.
*  That is decades ahead of even the advanced industrial
*  countries.
*  And I think the fact that they're dealing with this,
*  and that is going to have it behind them five years from now
*  eventually, is going to put them,
*  I would put in the long play for Brazil.
*  So I think markets are, I think India.
*  Because I think that the kind of growth that India has had,
*  I don't think is sustainable.
*  Partly going back to our earlier discussion
*  about premature industrialization,
*  I think they have these plans to really significantly strengthen
*  their manufacturing base.
*  I just don't think, I don't see it happening.
*  I think India can grow at 4% or 5% per year
*  on a sustainable basis.
*  I don't think it's going to be 8% to 9%.
*  And then when this sort of sinks in,
*  I think there's going to be a negative overreaction,
*  would be my fear.
*  Last question before we turn to the audience.
*  And this, again, is getting back to your book.
*  A reader wrote to me, Roderick was the Albert Hirschman
*  professor at Princeton.
*  And before that, he received an Albert Hirschman Prize.
*  Both Hirschman and Roderick are economists
*  who look at the same facts as everyone else,
*  but they see what nobody else has seen.
*  If you were allowed to make one change in the economics
*  profession or academia, this is an institutional change
*  or rules change, not an attitudinal change,
*  but an actual change in how things are done,
*  and a change in a graduate program.
*  If you could make one change to help produce more
*  Dana Rodricks for all the rest of us, what would that be?
*  I wish I had a very quick and good answer to this.
*  But it's certainly not a great answer,
*  but it probably would help.
*  I mean, I think I was helped a lot
*  by going into economics after having done political science.
*  And I think a lot of what's wrong in economics
*  is that it's so much driven by people who first
*  do engineering or math before they go into economics.
*  And it's relatively late that they get immersed
*  into the real world.
*  So I think anything that would get them a little bit more
*  cognizant of the problems of the real world,
*  even I would say that parts of political science
*  have become even worse than economics right now.
*  So I'm not sure that that would work.
*  I don't know, maybe sort of a gap year,
*  spending a year in a developing country between your first
*  and second year.
*  That's actually my idea as well.
*  So I'm glad to hear you say that.
*  There we go.
*  So we just now have to find somebody to finance it.
*  We now open up to the audience.
*  There are two mics.
*  Please get in line.
*  I will alternate.
*  Please note, these are questions for our guests,
*  not lengthy statements.
*  If you start making a lengthy statement, I will cut you off.
*  But please head up to the mics with your questions,
*  and I will call on you, and you will hear responses.
*  The mic over here.
*  Please just announce your name also.
*  My name is Caleb Watney.
*  I'm a master's student here, and I'm actually
*  considering spending the summer in a developing country.
*  So what one would you recommend?
*  One that you have not been to before,
*  or one in a continent that you haven't been to before.
*  I mean, I think I always tell my students that they should
*  always go to a country, when they have that chance
*  to spend a summer or a year, to go to somewhere which
*  is as different from where they have some experience as
*  possible.
*  Because I mean, that comparative sort of,
*  there are so many things you take for granted
*  that you don't even understand are things to be questioned.
*  It's only when you see another country that's so different,
*  then you start asking, but why is it,
*  how come that is working there?
*  It's not working here.
*  And so for that, as many opportunities
*  you have to be asking that question, which
*  is as different a place you can imagine from where you've
*  been to.
*  Given that I've only been in America and Mexico,
*  and I only have one summer, what would be the top of the list?
*  I'm looking for specifics.
*  Well, I mean, you go to India and travel,
*  and you will have seen so much diversity and variety.
*  So on this side.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm Richard Rubenstein.
*  I'm a teacher here.
*  I have my class here, in fact, today.
*  We are at the moment studying systems
*  that produce structural conflicts.
*  And so it makes me want to ask you,
*  when you talk about premature deindustrialization,
*  we're in the middle of looking at Rosa Luxemburg's work.
*  And I wondered what your explanation is for the,
*  whether there are structural causes for premature
*  deindustrialization.
*  If Luxemburg were here, she would
*  be talking about the effects of imperialism.
*  And so I wonder how you would explain it.
*  Well, of course, in the 19th century,
*  it was sort of formal and informal empire,
*  that the various, the so-called unequal trade
*  treaties and so forth.
*  Then you had India and China and the Ottoman Empire,
*  sort of all these nascent textile industries
*  being decimated by imports from Britain.
*  But of course, we also have cases
*  like Japan, which in the late 19th century,
*  despite having very low tariffs, being
*  able to develop its own domestic industry.
*  So we have at least one exception, even back then,
*  of a country that could industrialize,
*  despite those circumstances.
*  The late 20th and 21st century analog of that imperialism,
*  if you will, is China.
*  Because it's been China that has been essentially
*  swamping the world with manufactured goods.
*  So you go to a country like Ethiopia today in Africa,
*  and basically everything is imported from China.
*  So 50 years ago, a country like Ethiopia
*  would be manufacturing very simple things,
*  from footwear to tables and chairs to cardboard boxes.
*  But now, everything is coming from China.
*  So the fact that we moved to a stage of the world
*  where a country like China is able to exert
*  such strong effect on world markets and marketing
*  in manufacturers means that the opportunities for import
*  substitution in manufacturing is significantly less today
*  in the low income countries that have opened themselves up.
*  So it's not obviously imperialism,
*  but it's sort of like, if you will,
*  the imperialism of free trade.
*  This might be one way of putting it
*  for our current experience.
*  So that's clearly one.
*  It's also in terms of the fact that earlier I
*  was saying that traditionally, manufacturing
*  has had the ability to absorb a lot of unskilled labor.
*  Manufacturing has become more and more capital
*  and skill intensive over time.
*  So that means that now, even garments or textile footwear
*  become fairly skill intensive activity.
*  So the Chinese entrepreneur I mentioned,
*  when she goes to Ethiopia and opens up a footwear plant,
*  she's using very different kind of labor.
*  University graduates and very few, many, many fewer of them
*  compared to what the Chinese experience was.
*  So I think changes in technology and globalization
*  have been, I think, the two structural factors
*  behind pushing for prematurity industrialization.
*  Thank you.
*  On this side.
*  Hi.
*  My name's Ethan Olsup.
*  I'm a graduate student at the Fairfax George Mason campus.
*  Give me a sec.
*  I apologize.
*  This is written down because I didn't want to forget it.
*  When referring to the past political situation in Lebanon,
*  you characterized it as preferable
*  to the current more autocratic situation of today
*  in as much as a large number of cross-cutting cleavages
*  and the mutual understanding among them to the effect
*  that once in power, it's not necessarily
*  guaranteed in the future or something
*  like the mutual fear of what the other will do effectively
*  necessitated deal making and compromise.
*  So given this, what would be your position
*  on nuclear proliferation?
*  And aren't you, by virtue of this, sort of beholden
*  to the position that the more countries with nukes,
*  the more cross-cutting there would
*  be in the more effective, better functioning democracy?
*  And when will Turkey have nuclear weapons?
*  I'll just toss that in.
*  Well, you're really pushing me into my areas of incompetency.
*  I have no idea.
*  There's a question to say I have no inside knowledge
*  of that to share.
*  Now, so I think the question you were asking
*  is extending the notion that more cross-cutting cleavages
*  imply for greater political stability and tolerance
*  and moderation.
*  Can we take that idea to the international sphere
*  in particular, apply it to sort of nuclear proliferation?
*  If more states had nuclear weapons,
*  would that make the world safer?
*  I'm not quite sure about the analogy, the way
*  that you've taken that idea and extend it to the global sphere.
*  Because the notion of cross-cutting cleavages
*  has to do with sort of when you're operating not
*  in the state of anarchy, so to speak,
*  but when you're operating in a well-ordered sort of polity.
*  And I'm not sure that that analogy carries
*  to what is effectively the state of anarchy
*  at the global level, where there is no global government.
*  So the nature of competition is very different.
*  So I mean, the idea of nuclear proliferation
*  globally greatly worries me, not because I
*  think that the marginal country is
*  going to be less responsible than the countries that already
*  have nuclear weapons, but just because the more countries you
*  have them, the greater the chance that at least one of them
*  will be irresponsible rises.
*  So I think just probabilistically,
*  I think that makes me very, very nervous.
*  I think it's the analogy I don't think really quite applies.
*  That's fair.
*  Next question.
*  Thank you.
*  My name is Paulus Andretin, graduate student of politics
*  at Catholic University.
*  I'm Brazilian.
*  I have developing counter-experience
*  that is more than enough, probably.
*  Thank you for your words of hope on what's going down there.
*  Still, besides your words of hope,
*  chronic capitalism and draconian regulations
*  are more the rule than exception in Brazil.
*  I would like to know if you believe that Brazil, is there
*  a way of Brazil overcoming that in those five, six years
*  that you said, or put in another way,
*  do those issues actually matter?
*  Yeah, I mean, maybe it's easier to say, look,
*  I come to Brazil as a Turk.
*  I watch what's happening in Brazil.
*  I compare it to what is happening to Turkey now.
*  It's not like Turkey has had an easy time economically,
*  but the way that the financial markets have treated Turkey
*  is incomparable to how badly Brazil has been treated.
*  And then I look at chronic capitalism.
*  I see at least that in Brazil, we
*  have a system that's actually dealing with it,
*  and dealing with it in a way that's as clean
*  as one could hope for.
*  What's happening in Turkey?
*  What's happening in Turkey is that the extent of corruption
*  and chronic capitalism, the part of it that we have already seen
*  is vastly superior than anything that has come out in Brazil.
*  So we know that the president and his immediate family
*  have been greatly implicated in vast amounts of corruption.
*  And we know that.
*  The kind of thing that Dilma could be guilty of
*  pales in comparison.
*  And we have had the fact that anything in Turkey,
*  in terms of trying to delete the judiciary,
*  when it went into trying to clean the system up,
*  it did it in a way that was explicitly
*  politically motivated.
*  And therefore, it made it much easier for Erdogan
*  to actually clamp down on it, because it
*  was clear that it was just a politically motivated attack
*  on him, which makes neither side really right.
*  But what essentially means that in a country like Turkey,
*  you're postponing all these problems into the future.
*  They're going to hamper your development,
*  hamper your politics for decades to come.
*  And at least in Brazil, you're just dealing with these things,
*  and you're trying to overcome them.
*  Maybe it's not going to be five years.
*  Maybe you'll find other things that are happening.
*  But at least, with my recommendation to you,
*  is at least take pride that you have
*  a system that is actually trying to clean it up,
*  because that's really rare.
*  It's not happening in Turkey.
*  It's not happening in Thailand.
*  It's not happening in most developing countries
*  that I know of.
*  So I think in that way, I think Brazil is exemplary.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Next question.
*  My name is Elizabeth, and I'm a master's student here.
*  I read a small excerpt about your new book,
*  and I know that it's about economic models.
*  I was wondering how do you factor in just best practice
*  institutions?
*  Or when you consider economic models,
*  is there room to factor in, say, in your own words,
*  second best institutions?
*  And how effective would that be in the ultimate analysis
*  of a country or a model?
*  Look, I've said this before.
*  I hate the notion of best practice.
*  I mean, I think this is probably a very harmful notion.
*  I was a student of Avinash Dixit, who
*  was a great economist at Princeton,
*  and he likes to say, the world is second best at best.
*  So you always have to think in those terms.
*  And the notion of a best practice
*  is based on the idea that you can simply just have something
*  that works somewhere and take it and copy it,
*  apply it somewhere else.
*  Not only does that not work in general,
*  it also gives us a very lazy frame of mind.
*  So we end up developing all these World Economic Forum score
*  cards, or we have all these sort of checklists of business
*  environment rankings, or even the sustainable development
*  goals.
*  And I think to some extent, these things
*  can be important because of public relations, as PR
*  efforts.
*  But you look at all successful countries,
*  and what you'll see is that you've
*  had their societies and leaders who've always distilled
*  experience from elsewhere from the lens
*  of their own local knowledge.
*  And I think that's when you get that combination,
*  is really when things work.
*  And a sort of best practice kind of a mindset, I think,
*  is an enemy of that.
*  Question here.
*  Last question.
*  Hi, my name is Shreyas Shekhar.
*  I'm an undergrad student from George Washington.
*  I just had a question.
*  So given that industrial policy largely failed
*  in post-independence India to a great extent,
*  do you advise the present Indian government
*  to go ahead with conventional industrial policy of picking
*  winners and losers?
*  Or should they just instead liberalize factors and focus
*  on expanding access to capital?
*  And just a second part.
*  If they do go ahead with the strategy,
*  do you think global demand right now
*  is strong enough to sustain an export-based growth strategy,
*  or will it largely fail?
*  You have three minutes to answer for a billion people.
*  Well, first, I would never recommend the country
*  to do anything conventional.
*  I think it relates to some of the things
*  that we were discussing.
*  Yes, I think the returns to industrial policy
*  are lower now.
*  The returns to any export-oriented strategy
*  are also lower now.
*  We haven't talked about this, but really, I
*  think there's a sense in which the world economy isn't
*  going to be as much of an engine for growth,
*  for developing and emerging markets in the future
*  as it has been until now, as will manufacturing industry
*  will not be that.
*  But I don't see this trade-off between fundamentals
*  versus a more proactive government policy that's
*  trying to generate new industries, not just
*  manufacturing, but also services.
*  I think what I always look for is a very pragmatic attitude
*  towards the private sector and the business sector, which
*  is where the government is saying,
*  what is it that we can do to unlock possibilities
*  and keep an open mind on that?
*  It doesn't mean you're going to be picking winners,
*  but it doesn't mean that you're going
*  to be willing to get activities started that might not
*  have started otherwise.
*  And just some of them will fail.
*  That's in the nature of things.
*  But I think having tried and failed
*  is better often than not having tried at all.
*  And there's no trade-off, really.
*  I mean, you can do that and also work on your fundamentals,
*  on your skills, and your capital base,
*  and your infrastructure, certainly as India has to do.
*  And Indian economic policy has very much, I think,
*  moved in that direction.
*  So I think that's fairly consistent with what
*  the government is already doing, except that I
*  think they just exaggerate how much growth
*  and how much industrialization they can really get.
*  Thank you so much for all of those stimulating words.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  There will be a book signing out front with Danny,
*  Economics Rules.
*  It is out this October.
*  All of you here should buy and read it.
*  Thank you again.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Tyler.
