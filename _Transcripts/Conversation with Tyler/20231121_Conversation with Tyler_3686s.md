Video Description: Travel writer Juan Pablo Villarino had visited 90 countries before making the trek to exotic Arlington, Virginia for this chat with Tyler. Amazingly enough, this recording marked his first trip to the mainland United States, which is now the 91st country in an ever-expanding list.

The world's best hitchhiker talks with Tyler about the joys of connecting with people, why it's so hard to avoid stereotypes (including of hitchhikers), how stamp collecting guides his trips, the darkest secrets of people he's gotten rides from, traveling and writing books with his wife, the cause of violence in the Americas, finding the emotional heart of a journey, where he's going next, and more.

*  The most recent now is out only in Argentina. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=51.2s)]

*  It is called Hitchhiking in the Axis of Evil, by thumb through Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=56.720000000000006s)]
*  Juan Pablo, welcome. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Hi, Tyler. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=64.72s)]
*  Thanks a lot for the invitation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Really honored to be here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=67.12s)]
*  If you could just start by telling us, I mean, who are you and what have you been doing? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=72.48s)]
*  So I'm a travel writer. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=73.2s)]
*  I have been busy in the last 13 years hitchhiking around the world in an attempt, let's say, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=75.44s)]
*  to document hospitality. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=80.24s)]
*  And this adventure has taken me across over 91 countries, including the United States, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  which is my last addition to the list. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=88.24s)]
*  And given what you do, do you ever think, well, why doesn't everyone do this? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=90.24s)]
*  Have you come to the point where you see your way of life as a sort of default, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=94.64s)]
*  as actually posing a question about the alternatives to mainstream culture and normal life, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  with family, kids, rent, walk the dog? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  Or do you think it's just a strange niche taste that only you have? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=106.24s)]
*  I think that actually more and more people should choose their own place in society on their [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=109.12s)]
*  road. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=113.36s)]
*  So I don't think this is for everyone, but I do believe in the whole... [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=113.92s)]
*  A lot of messages I receive on social media has led me to think that a lot of people actually [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=118.56s)]
*  want this, to have a much more nomadic lifestyle and to redesign their own lifestyle. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  And that's pretty much what I am aiming to while trying to motivate my readers. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=130.08s)]
*  And is it that you think living this kind of life makes you happier, or it's a form of aspiration, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=135.28s)]
*  where you like the kind of person it will transform you into, and maybe it's actually in some ways [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=141.04s)]
*  tougher or more burdensome on you, but you want to be a different kind of person? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=145.68s)]
*  You mean like when this lifestyle would intrinsically make you happier? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=149.84s)]
*  Right. Or you simply think it's a better life? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=154.16s)]
*  I think it's the kind of life I desire and I have desired since I was a student. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=157.28s)]
*  I think everyone should pursue his or her own dreams, but I don't think it's like a universal [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=161.28s)]
*  formula that should be exported in a massive way, then everyone should do this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=167.04s)]
*  But then if you look at a world map and when you look at a strange place like Kyrgyzstan or [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=171.68s)]
*  Greenland, and then you feel like butterflies in your stomach, then you should pay attention to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=177.44s)]
*  silence and then go for it and not just pretend it's not happening. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  And what's the single most concrete feature of this new life that has so drawn you in? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=185.76s)]
*  Is it seeing new faces every day, the thrill of the unexpected, simply being able to walk so much, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=191.28s)]
*  talking with drivers? What would it be? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=197.12s)]
*  I think the final, yeah, what's thrown me into this, it's the chance to have something to do, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=199.76s)]
*  at least with more and more different cultures at times. So, you know, when a country is mentioned [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  on the news, call it Syria, Afghanistan, Romania, Norway, any country, and then you have something [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=212.24s)]
*  to recall which is not abstract, it's not a tag or a flag, but you can recall in your memory, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  like real people you have related with. And then I think you, I feel much more [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=222.72s)]
*  threaded with humanity and with mankind in the broader sense. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=227.12s)]
*  And living as a hitchhiker, how much social freedom do you think you have on a permanent basis? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  So if you think of people in mainstream society, there's so much expected from them in terms of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  conformity at work and the family. So you're out there on the road, but over time, is there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=239.84s)]
*  a restriction of social freedom that sets in? Like the other hitchhikers expect you to be a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=245.12s)]
*  certain way, your readers, your fans, they expect something on the Instagram account. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=249.52s)]
*  Have you evolved into more social freedom or ended up just as constricted? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=254.32s)]
*  Well, I guess it's a nice question. I love that. It's always those stereotypes. Actually, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=257.92s)]
*  the reason why I travel is because I want to, in a way, dismantle the stereotypes [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=263.52s)]
*  that there are about certain nations, like Colombia or Muslim countries, but as well, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=268.56s)]
*  there are stereotypes about people, not only about nations. And there is certainly a stereotype about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=274.56s)]
*  what type of life a hitchhiker should lead. So there's people actually having expectations on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=281.44s)]
*  me. Actually, I don't think I fit with the stereotype. Like if some people have described [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=285.6s)]
*  me in some newspapers as, oh, he leads like a nomadic life with no bills, no fixed direction [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=290.72s)]
*  and no bills or taxes to pay. But I also have a house and I also have a point of reference in the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=296.4s)]
*  world, where we have a place. And that's in Argentina. In Marta Plata. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=303.67999999999995s)]
*  It's actually in another city in San Nicolas because that's where my girlfriend comes from. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  So when we met, it was kind of a pact. Okay, we're going to live traveling, but whenever we are not [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=312.96s)]
*  on the road, I want to be near my family. So that was her condition for being nomadic. So we live [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=317.12s)]
*  there, but we go back there only to write the books because we need our concentration or space [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=324.0s)]
*  or archive of notebooks and everything. But then we go back to the road and like 50% and 50%, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=329.2s)]
*  you know, like one year or one year and a half traveling. Then we go back home like one year [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=334.48s)]
*  in order to start a book project. But yeah, the thing about stereotypes, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=338.8s)]
*  people would think, you know, they just would feel surprised. I am, for example, a philatelist. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=344.0s)]
*  I collect 19th century stamps and that would be, I think, as far away as a stereotype from [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=348.4s)]
*  a hitchhiker as it can be. And then people just expect you to be like a hippie without it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=355.12s)]
*  But I'm also attached to things, but I just decided to hitchhike around the world, not out of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  an economic condition or out of being poor. There was also a journalist who stated that, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  oh, he chose the way he wanted to be poor. It's not about that, you know. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=369.52s)]
*  You buy the stamps online or you hitchhike to places where you think you might want to buy stamps? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=374.08s)]
*  No, no, I think I buy online, but it's actually interesting to say that my first approach to world [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  geography and history was through stamps when I was a kid. And then I have actually [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=384.64s)]
*  designed trips in order to fit with territories that I had learned about from stamps, collecting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  like old colonies in Africa and stuff like that. What strategies do you employ so that drivers, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=393.76s)]
*  indeed strangers, trust you more? Okay. I think like as a rule of thumb, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=399.84s)]
*  I always like to say that you stop cars with your smile and not with your thumb. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=405.44s)]
*  So there are actually a lot of things you can do to improve your chances of getting a lift. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=410.64s)]
*  It's not just like, you know, go there, stick out your thumb and get the ride. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=414.4s)]
*  And I think like really definitely smiling as the car is passing, you know, it's a really [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  important thing. And then there are like very subtle things that people wouldn't guess that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  have an impact and they do. Which ones? Okay. So for example, like it's like there's a driver has [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=427.6s)]
*  like average three seconds to decide or five, whether he's going to stop or not. You know, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  he sees you, he's driving maybe 80 miles an hour and then you just suddenly pop up. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=438.56s)]
*  There are a lot of things going on unconsciously through his mind to decide where he's going to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=443.12s)]
*  stop or not. So you have only these seconds to convey an image of trust. So then you have to do [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  things. So for example, one is smiling. The other one is when you manage to get eye contact, then I [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=452.0s)]
*  reinforce, okay, I'm the same thumbing and showing my thumb, but I also switch my hand signal and I [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=457.04s)]
*  point the direction, I point the direction in which I'm going as I'm smiling. And this makes a more [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=464.72s)]
*  personalized link over the general link you're already doing, which is thumbing, you know? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=470.48s)]
*  And then the way you're dressed, the way your backpack is positioned. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=476.24s)]
*  How do you dress? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=479.68s)]
*  So I try always to be neutral. So I really don't think the road is a place to manifest your [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=481.12s)]
*  aesthetic principles. Like if you like, you know, dreadlocks and a lot of things. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=487.52s)]
*  So social conformity, raise its head again. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=490.88s)]
*  Just a t-shirt and you know, like normal cargo pants. So I guess neutral. I try to be as tidy [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  as I can. And yeah, people pay attention to that. And that's a way to make them develop more trust in you. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  In the 18th century, a French political writer Montesquieu, he claimed that poorer peoples show [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  more hospitality to strangers on average. Do you think he was right? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  I think it has to do with many things, not only with economical factors. For example, if you go [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=515.84s)]
*  to countries like Ethiopia, in Africa, where you can find really poor people by our standards, and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=520.72s)]
*  then you will not find or receive as much hospitality as I have received, for example, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=525.52s)]
*  in Muslim countries like Iran or Syria. So this has to do with like the way or the place [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  that interdependence has as a value in that society. And for example, in the Middle East, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=537.04s)]
*  and it doesn't necessarily have to do with religion, but with geographical things. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=541.36s)]
*  In the Middle East, I have found that people has been through millennial [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=544.8s)]
*  used to depend on each other because of the long distances and the living in a desert scenario where [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=548.56s)]
*  you could eventually need the help of your neighbors tomorrow. So you help them today. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=554.8s)]
*  This I have found in the Middle East and the Muslim countries. I wouldn't consider them poor, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=559.52s)]
*  but I would put them in a middle scale because if we consider Africa as well. But in general, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=564.4799999999999s)]
*  people, countries which are used to share resources for whatever reason, being religious [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  or being because they were part of the communist bloc, which also developed some social structures [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=580.88s)]
*  in which sharing sources was very common. So then it's easy today to hitchhike in Romania or Poland. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=586.24s)]
*  So there are many, many indicators or things that could make that bar right. But in general, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=591.76s)]
*  yeah, I could say that Montesquieu had a point, let's say. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=597.04s)]
*  Pete And do you have a thought on why some of the societies that seem to show the most trust [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=600.24s)]
*  with respect to hitchhikers in other ways, perhaps superficial or misguided, but seem to show lower [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=604.96s)]
*  levels of trust? So you mentioned Iraq as being a good country to hitchhike. Iraq is not known at [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=610.64s)]
*  the macro or political level for always having a high degree of trust. Do you have thoughts on that [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=615.84s)]
*  possible contradiction? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=620.64s)]
*  Fabio I think that the problem is that we perceive countries just because of what we heard on the news. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=621.84s)]
*  So, or either we kind of know, most people would only know about Iraq or Sudan, let's say Sudan, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  about they will only know that it's a blockade, economic blockade and sanctions from the US in [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=634.0s)]
*  the late 90s. And then people would know about the Taliban in Afghanistan, about the war in Iraq. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=639.2s)]
*  But then we never get to know about the real people living there under those flags. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'm trying to compensate with my travel literature. So I think, yeah, you can say [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=650.08s)]
*  it's a contradiction, but I would say it's the way that information is treated, stereotypes and the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=657.84s)]
*  way the kind of news that the media like to show is always about either the wars or the things going [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  on between leaders. But like the normal people, they just never make it to the headlines. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=671.84s)]
*  And there are some published estimates you've offered how long it takes to get a ride in [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=676.64s)]
*  different places. If I may just quote, so the quickest is listed as Iraq, seven minutes on [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=680.08s)]
*  average. Next quickest is Jordan, nine minutes on average, then Ecuador, 10 minutes, Romania, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=685.12s)]
*  12 minutes. The slowest of them all seems to be Tibet, where your estimate is three hours, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=690.4s)]
*  16 minutes. Now, why is Tibet in that liar on the other side of that equation? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=695.84s)]
*  That's right. But the thing is like in the case of Tibet, there were so, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=699.68s)]
*  the main vehicles were so scarce because it's just like a plateau with one road crossing it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=704.7199999999999s)]
*  And maybe you would see 10 vehicles a day. Just not that many cars. It's not a lack of hospitality. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=709.12s)]
*  Exactly. So then you should consider different factors when you want to measure how good or bad [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=714.64s)]
*  hitchhiking is in a country. You shouldn't actually only take into consideration the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=718.9599999999999s)]
*  waiting time, but you should consider the amount of cars that pass you [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=722.64s)]
*  know, during your hitchhiking. So that gives an estimate, but there are many factors that should [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  be considered. But in your six slowest, you have in that worst six, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=731.68s)]
*  Scandinavia, slow times, and those countries have plenty of cars. Why are they so slow? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=738.64s)]
*  That's amazing to be hitchhiking in Scandinavia. You see all these row of Volvo cars passing you [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=743.28s)]
*  by and they will never ever stop. I have talked to a Swedish friend of mine and she just said like, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=747.5999999999999s)]
*  yeah, it would be, I wouldn't stop either. She said, because it's so cheap and affordable [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=753.84s)]
*  to have a car. Then if someone is hitchhiking and doesn't have a car, you would think he has [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=757.84s)]
*  second intentions on something wrong is going on here. What I think it happens is that somehow, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=762.72s)]
*  you know, our society has led us into a, you know, you have your own house, your own, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=769.44s)]
*  when you get out of the house, you just move into your little bit of moving private space into your [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=775.6s)]
*  car. And it's sometimes difficult to break that cycle and, you know, and be ready to share to me, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=782.72s)]
*  to mix. And I think that has, that's pretty much the norm in like Nordic societies. So yeah, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=788.48s)]
*  it makes it a bit more difficult to hitchhike there. And a typical year, how many months of the year [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=794.72s)]
*  are you out there hitchhiking? So it's, I wouldn't measure it of how many months a year, but what [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  happens is like we, Laura and I, we always do long trips. That's your wife, Laura. Yeah, Laura, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=806.32s)]
*  that's right. For the last eight years, we have been traveling together. And we always do long [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=810.56s)]
*  trips. That means that the shortest one together, it has been eight months and the longest like [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=816.64s)]
*  a year and a half. So each trip is made with the idea of making a book afterwards. So after the [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  trip is done, then we go back home and start the book project, which normally takes like another [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  year. So it's a 50-50, I would say. Yeah. Would you describe yourself as a workaholic? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=835.6s)]
*  I guess, yes. A workaholic hitchhiker. I am, I am. People would be so surprised to see how much time [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=840.96s)]
*  there is involved on the backstage behind the screen, because yeah, you hitchhike and you have [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=848.08s)]
*  books and you have a blog. But oh, the blog is so time consuming. You know, when I'm not traveling, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=852.88s)]
*  I literally spend like 10 hours a day working either by, you know, making new posts, posting [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=858.72s)]
*  social media, preparing projects for publishing houses. And it's like an eight to 10 hours routine. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=863.6s)]
*  So yeah, I would, I would qualify as a workaholic, I guess. But you don't always travel with your [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=869.6s)]
*  wife. Is that correct? Some trips with her, some trips alone. How do you divvy up which trip is [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=874.72s)]
*  with her or with which trip is not with her? So long trips, we do them together always, like, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=879.28s)]
*  because it requires like an year and a half. Like our last trip together was Africa, from Egypt to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=885.52s)]
*  South Africa on the eastern side, going like through Sudan, Ethiopia, and so on. That we did [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=890.72s)]
*  together, of course. But then after that, like, you know, I came here, she's going to Thailand next [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=895.28s)]
*  month. Or she, for example, like last year, she went to Iceland with a friend and hitchhike around [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=900.88s)]
*  Iceland. And they had some project to do some challenges, like the audience were suggesting [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=906.64s)]
*  her and her friend challenges to do while traveling. So we do these little side projects [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  on our own. I was in Cuba as well two years ago. But the long trips we do, we always do them together. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=917.2s)]
*  So your wife is doing some trips on her own. Your general lifestyle, how much harder do you think [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=923.44s)]
*  it is for a solo woman to do what you've been doing? It could be your wife, but there are plenty of [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=928.6400000000001s)]
*  other women who do or might want to do this. What would you say to that? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=933.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. There have been, and I know actually some of my inspirations have been [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=936.88s)]
*  girls traveling alone by hitchhiking. One of them is Kinga Free Spirit, just like a nickname. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=942.2399999999999s)]
*  Like a Polish girl who hitchhiked around the world from 98 to 2003 and did amazing stuff. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  I was barely there to do crossing from Burkina Faso to Niger on a camelback, you know, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=954.88s)]
*  without, not through an official limit and not through an official border crossing. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=962.56s)]
*  And amazing stuff like that. And yeah, I know a couple of girls who have hitchhiked across Africa [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=967.36s)]
*  alone. And done fine? Yeah, yeah, yeah, and done fine. So that doesn't mean that it's a 100% [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=972.64s)]
*  pink experience in which everything is going to be fine. You definitely have to know your limitations [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  and your own template and it must not be your first trip for sure. But I think that the general [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=986.4s)]
*  difficulties of traveling as a woman are not really different from the general difficulties [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=995.44s)]
*  of living as a woman in our society. What's the deepest, darkest secret you've ever heard [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1001.12s)]
*  from someone who has picked you up? Okay, so that's something called the Taxi Cab Effect. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1006.1600000000001s)]
*  And it translates into people telling you all sorts of secrets after giving you a ride, you know, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1012.0s)]
*  like from the most simple things like someone picking me up, like it was like a rural worker [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1016.8800000000001s)]
*  in Argentina and telling me, Hey, you know, I have just been with another woman, which is not my wife. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1021.68s)]
*  It was just jumpy around and tell me all details. I didn't want to hear. But then I had like [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1027.04s)]
*  all sorts of people. I remember a truck driver in Spain who took me all the way to Italy. I was like [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  one day and a half of driving and he had been in the foreign region and he had been in the Iraqi [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1039.12s)]
*  war in the first Iraq, in the Gulf war. And he had all sorts of traumas that the health Spanish [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1044.32s)]
*  system hadn't been able to solve. It seems. And he was, you know, every time he would go down the [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1050.56s)]
*  truck, it would be just for a, for a, to fight with someone. No, he wouldn't be able to establish [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1055.2s)]
*  normal relations. And after a day and a half of traveling, when I left, he was just crying over [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  the world because he had been able to, to build a relationship with someone inside the truck one day [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1064.96s)]
*  and a half. I was so difficult for them, for him then to, to see me leave. But I think like the, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1071.04s)]
*  the most interesting one in the lift was in the list. It was an Italian guy who he didn't give me [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1078.0800000000002s)]
*  a ride, but he hosted me in his house. And then after many bottles of wine, he acknowledged he [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1082.64s)]
*  had been in jail for trafficking drug between Naples and Milan and that he had done terrible [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1089.1200000000001s)]
*  things. Like an hour later, he confessed he had killed someone and that he had a bit of his past [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1096.64s)]
*  that he wanted to like a physical thing from his past that he needed to get rid of. And five [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1103.28s)]
*  minutes later, he presented me with a knife. Yes. And so it was basically a piece of evidence of a [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  murder. And that was the murder knife. Yeah. And what did you do with it? I felt that I had to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1113.68s)]
*  carry it because he needed to, to get away with that. And if I could help in any way for his [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1118.0s)]
*  rehabilitation, because he had legally already paid for that anyway, you know, he had been in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1123.04s)]
*  jail for that. And so I felt I had to take it with me and I did. The American author, Jack Karawacki, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1126.8s)]
*  in his book on the road, he suggested that maybe the real problem with hitchhiking is you feel [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1133.28s)]
*  obliged to entertain your driver on and on. And this can be quite monotonous. Do you ever find this [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1138.16s)]
*  to be the case? And well, sometimes you can get bored, but I think it's, I mean, that's the reason [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1143.36s)]
*  why hitchhike in the first place, you know, to, to mix and meet people. Cause I know it's, has never [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1147.68s)]
*  been a matter of money. Like I do hitchhiking in India or places where transportation is so cheap. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1153.2s)]
*  So sometimes it can be boring to repeat over and over your story or where do you come from? What [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1157.6s)]
*  are you doing? You know, in each, in each car you board, but you know, it pays, it pays off because [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1163.04s)]
*  then the people have such amazing stories to share. And it's actually like my default setting, my [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1169.44s)]
*  typical approach to explore a country is hitchhiking. That's why I do it. So I think it's worth. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1176.8799999999999s)]
*  And what's the biggest danger you face? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1182.1599999999999s)]
*  I think definitely that I don't have to think too much about is it was in Afghanistan because [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1184.1599999999999s)]
*  actually there into hitchhiking across the country post a threat because there were, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1189.28s)]
*  even though my trip was meant to show the 99.9% of the people there were just like nice people. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1194.4s)]
*  Then I knew there was still the 0.1% that could be harmful. And then when getting close to Kabul, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1199.8400000000001s)]
*  I was hitchhiking actually with an American guy who was a volunteer in Bamyan province, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1206.48s)]
*  where the big Buddha's used to be carved, you know, before the Taliban's that act there. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1213.44s)]
*  He was so excited about my hitchhiking thing. And he said, I want to join you. And I said, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1217.28s)]
*  I, yeah, you can, but you know, remember that your life here is much more valuable than mine. Like [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1220.56s)]
*  they could take you as a hostage, but not really to me because Argentina will not pay any rescuer. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1225.76s)]
*  So, you know, they, and they know that. So, but we hitchhiked to Kabul and we got a ride with an [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1231.3600000000001s)]
*  Afghan police Jeep. They were patrolling. So they stopped and say, guys, we can take you to Kabul, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1235.76s)]
*  but you have to know that we are the target. The last patrol we sent here was attacked by the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1241.52s)]
*  Taliban with a rocket propelled grenade and everyone died in the ambush. And now we are going [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1245.44s)]
*  to see if the territory is better. So you can come with us or you can do the same, but walking. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1250.88s)]
*  And I say, okay, well, we should better stay in the car. At least it's faster. And the next two [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1256.64s)]
*  hours were the most difficult hours of my life. You know, these guys were with the AK-47 with a [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1263.04s)]
*  finger in the trigger, ready to fight. And they told us actually to have a look at the roofs of [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1268.56s)]
*  the houses because they were expecting like snipers. And so, you know, suddenly I was like [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1274.24s)]
*  in an army scenario that has nothing to do with my life, but I think definitely that was like the [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1279.52s)]
*  most, the closer I was to a potentially further situation. Do you feel there's something you [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1284.56s)]
*  understand about terrorism in say Iraq or Afghanistan that most other people would not? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1291.44s)]
*  I guess that first of all, like people would unfortunately relate just terrorism to the names [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1297.84s)]
*  of these countries and they would miss like the broader picture, which is like the whole people [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1305.04s)]
*  living there. Then, but then I can also understand how like terrorists come to being because also [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1311.2s)]
*  being in these countries, which they have sometimes, I mean, in a way they are absolutely open to [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1317.68s)]
*  foreigners, but at the same time, they, it's a, it's an easy round in which to recruit people [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1323.76s)]
*  because they are, you know, overpopulation, religiously speaking, it could be very, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1330.32s)]
*  I think like Islam needs an instance of like self-criticism. I think these societies haven't [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1336.72s)]
*  been able to go through a process of like updating and allowing self-criticism. So I think that in [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1341.28s)]
*  this sense, they are a bit closed minded. So I think that it's easy. It has been easy for like [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1349.04s)]
*  insurgent groups to recruit people. And yeah, I have seen, you know, like the social mechanisms [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1356.08s)]
*  behind it and the way they really like, some time ago I was in Egypt and there was a school [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1362.3999999999999s)]
*  and the, the motto of the school was that they wanted to produce good citizens and good Muslims [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1368.56s)]
*  they would be able to repeat the Quran by heart. So as long as they keep, you know, their goals of [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1374.8000000000002s)]
*  education as being able to repeat the Quran by heart, then it's always leaving a gate open for, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, people who are so fervent about it. If you consider your longer trip, say the trip [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  through Africa, and I were to suggest a hypothesis that every longest trip has at its core some kind [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1391.44s)]
*  of central place or event or a kind of emotional heart, maybe not planned in advance, probably not [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1397.5200000000002s)]
*  planned in advance, but at the end of the trip, you realize this emotional heart of the trip is [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1403.92s)]
*  there. And if it's not there, you did something wrong. Agree or disagree? I agree. Definitely. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1408.64s)]
*  Yeah. There are moments, big moments in which, you know, you really feel the whole mystic of the, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  of the trip embodying there. And yeah, and Africa had several of these moments. What would be the [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1417.92s)]
*  central core of your Africa trip, if you had to say? Well, there will be more than one, but I [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1424.64s)]
*  guess that Tanzania, Tanzania, or I don't know how to say it in English, Tanzania. Tanzania. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1428.96s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. Tanzania was one, because there I would, I did find in Africa, proud to be Africa, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1433.76s)]
*  you know, was a bit more different from the place, from the situation I found in like South Africa, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1440.16s)]
*  in which they're having so many tensions, ongoing tensions between groups and ethnic groups. But I [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1444.96s)]
*  really like love Tanzania, but now I recall a moment in which it was like a very dense moment [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1449.52s)]
*  because it shows that you can learn from everyone in these kinds of trips. It was in Malawi and we [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1456.56s)]
*  were looking for a place to camp in outside the capital in Lilongwe. And it was raining like hell. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1462.08s)]
*  We asked like a couple of people, they didn't give us any solution. And then we arrived to a [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1469.9199999999998s)]
*  place with, with, looked like, you know, these places where they organize, like a venue where [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1473.9199999999998s)]
*  they organize children birthday parties. Yes. Okay. The place was closed, but it was a caretaker. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1478.56s)]
*  This guy was 25 year old. He was a refugee from Congo. He had crossed all Tanzania on foot to [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1483.6s)]
*  reach there, crossing rivers infested with crocodiles being chased by Tanzanian police [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  who wanted to surprise from him. And so he had managed to reach there and find this little job [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1495.6s)]
*  and he allows to, to, to sleep in this house. He was taken care of. So that was like the inversion [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1499.76s)]
*  of the logic, you know, that it was the refugee was giving us, he was the provider for us at night. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1505.76s)]
*  And the interesting thing was that all the, the situations he had to go through on the war and so [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1510.96s)]
*  long, he hadn't, it hadn't turned converted into resentment, but into love. The guy told me first [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  that mountains, he said this sentence that I can recall. He said mountains are not meant to, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1524.8000000000002s)]
*  to encounter, to meet, but actually, but men are meant to meet. And that's why he opened the house [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1531.2s)]
*  to us. And then he said, we were talking about international situation and he said, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1537.76s)]
*  Oh, about Mr. Trump, I understand him. He said, if I could tell something to him in person, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1543.84s)]
*  I will, I would say, I will tell him that I understand him because he's not a bad guy. He [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1551.12s)]
*  said, and I want to say his words here because he would only dream about coming to the U S but I'm [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1556.08s)]
*  feeling, I feel like a messenger now. And he said that he understood he was not a bad guy, but that [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1560.64s)]
*  he hadn't gone through any hardship in his life. And that's why his heart was so hard. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1566.32s)]
*  And then I felt, okay, this guy, I mean, you can learn from anyone in the strips. This guy is a [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1572.0s)]
*  caretaker. He was a refugee and now he's now talking like a Buddha, you know, in Malawi. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  So I feel like when you have these little encounters with random people, that's when the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1582.3999999999999s)]
*  trip becomes really meaningful. My favorite song about hitchhiking is probably Marvin Gaye, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1587.12s)]
*  hitchhike. Do you have a favorite song about hitchhiking? I don't think I can recall any, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1591.84s)]
*  you know, any song about hitchhiking, probably pros and cons of hitchhiking of Roger Waters. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1597.12s)]
*  Yeah, that would be and try also Vanity Fair hitching a ride. That's fun. Okay. Now you [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1601.76s)]
*  told us this is actually your first time in the United States. That's right. Your 91st country. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1606.48s)]
*  Is that right? It is because I was actually for a week in Puerto Rico, like three years ago. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1610.8s)]
*  Okay. So it's officially the U S but let's say it's the first time in the mainland. And how long have [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1614.72s)]
*  you been here? So less than 48 hours. What has surprised you the most so far? What has surprised [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1619.92s)]
*  me? Well, looking at the suburban areas from the plane was quite interesting because they're which [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1625.44s)]
*  areas suburban housing states and areas because they look as a Latin American textile pattern. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1630.0s)]
*  You know, it's very strange. The icon of the U S looks like a like a aboriginal art piece, but then [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1636.96s)]
*  yeah, I would basically how the city I'm in Arlington now how the city gets depopulated [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1644.0s)]
*  at night after 8pm. There's no very few people on the streets, at least in the downtown. Nobody [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1650.24s)]
*  lives there. It's just like offices, blocks and buildings. And yes, so this is a bit curious for [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1654.4s)]
*  me because I'm used to live in a more lived in city, you know, Argentine is almost the polar [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1657.6000000000001s)]
*  opposite in this regard. Buenos Aires at midnight can be quite teeming with people. Yeah, sure. I [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1663.52s)]
*  mean, you can get out of the street at one a.m. go to a kiosk and buy a drink or whatever you [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1667.92s)]
*  want. Yeah, sure. That's Latin America. It's like that. Now, in a sense, you started this journey, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1672.96s)]
*  if I understand your history correctly in Belfast, Northern Ireland. How did Belfast come to pass? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1678.08s)]
*  So that was pretty random. Actually, I was so I was a student of psychology in Argentina where [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1683.3600000000001s)]
*  before I decided to take this nomadic lifestyle. At some point, I, you know, took the decision. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1689.3600000000001s)]
*  I decided it was much more consistent. Even with the subject I was studying was much more consistent [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1694.0s)]
*  to go and see history unfolding in front of my nose than just staying at university. But then [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1699.04s)]
*  a family I used to have a summer job at a hotel, just like a bellboy or receptionist. And there was [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1705.36s)]
*  a family from Northern Ireland who I had talked to them and I had explained them I wanted to travel [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1711.44s)]
*  around the world, but I wanted to to save up some money to start to get started. Because in those [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1717.04s)]
*  years, Argentina was through going through its worst economic crisis. Right. All the banks had [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1722.24s)]
*  fled the country taking the savings of the people with them was like a chaos. And I was the only [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1727.44s)]
*  weird guy dreaming about, you know, and attaching things and going around the world. And there was [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1732.72s)]
*  a pretty strange thing. People were trying to get stability, not trying to get rid of, you know, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1737.44s)]
*  their stability to travel. But so this family from Northern Ireland, actually, they, yeah, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1741.92s)]
*  they offered me if you ever come over here, you have a place to stay, and we can, you know, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1747.76s)]
*  keep you going until you find a job. And that was what I did in year 2003. I moved to Belfast, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1752.24s)]
*  actually to a small town near Belfast, found a job in another hotel as receptionist, and then slowly [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1757.52s)]
*  started to move jobs. I worked there for like a year and a half before I thought I had small budget [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1762.8000000000002s)]
*  for the first year of the trip. And given that most people in the two Ireland's are no longer [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1769.68s)]
*  formally religious, if you had to describe in your vision, the core cultural difference between [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1774.5600000000002s)]
*  Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, what would that be? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1779.52s)]
*  Well, I could even tell you the difference between Eastern Belfast and Western Belfast, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1782.72s)]
*  because that's summarized there. West Belfast is typically a stronghold of the Republican, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1786.24s)]
*  you know, Catholic, let's say like the Irish who are trapped there, but would like to join [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1793.68s)]
*  the Republic of Ireland, while North and East Belfast are like Unionist, which support being [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1798.08s)]
*  the same attached to Great Britain. And of course, like, it's interesting because actually the [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1803.6s)]
*  family that gave me the chance to go there, they were British, you know, they were pro-Irish. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1810.08s)]
*  So I like that because it breaks like the stereotype and it's a good starting point of [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1815.2s)]
*  the biography of this trip, which is trying to dismantle stereotypes. So they were not on the [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1819.12s)]
*  side they were supposed to be. But then I met great people from both sides, but mostly my friends [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1825.6s)]
*  tended to be from West Belfast. So they were. From a hitchhiking point of view, how do the two [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1830.56s)]
*  Ireland's differ if at all? No, they don't. I think like, you know, the same way they share a [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1835.12s)]
*  rugby team, they share their position in the hospitality ranking. Okay. Now, as we know, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1839.2s)]
*  you're from Argentina and Argentina has its own history as being a victim of colonial occupation. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1845.44s)]
*  There's still an ongoing issue with Malinvas, the Falkland Islands, as we say in English. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1851.36s)]
*  Your background as an Argentinian, how do you feel that has shaped your understanding of Syria, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1856.0s)]
*  Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq? Well, actually, it helped my understanding and their understanding [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1861.44s)]
*  because it was very easy. It's actually easy to travel around the world with an Argentinian [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1867.44s)]
*  passport. And it's good because people, you know, feel empathy because you also come from, let's say, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1873.68s)]
*  developing country or we're not, we are, you know, we are like in the middle, we are not like a rich [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1881.12s)]
*  country, we're not a poor one. But people, but we know, we know what it's like to live in a place [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1885.12s)]
*  where the traffic lights don't work and people just cross with the red cross. And so yeah, it [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1890.4799999999998s)]
*  has made easier to relate with people from Africa, for example, when I was explaining that we also [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1895.4399999999998s)]
*  had a colonial rule in our country, they were so surprised about that. And that was a good point [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1901.4399999999998s)]
*  of connection with people. You've written, I believe that Colombia is one of your favorite [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1906.32s)]
*  countries to travel. Indeed. What makes Colombia so special? Colombia, Colombia, people, I mean, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1910.72s)]
*  they have poetry when they speak. I mean, you can speak with anyone there, doesn't matter which walk [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1917.04s)]
*  of life that you belong to, can be a coffee collector, can be the owner of a company. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1921.6000000000001s)]
*  They will have the same cautious way of speaking. And even though it's not actually easy to hitch [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1927.28s)]
*  hiking in Colombia, because of all the problems they have had with, you know, with guerrillas and [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1932.64s)]
*  kidnapping, they are a bit cautious at the time of giving you a ride. But once you are there and [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1936.16s)]
*  you're talking to people, I mean, that's, I really wish everyone could spend a couple of days a month [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1940.64s)]
*  in Colombia to take all the stress away. You've also cited Transnistria as one of your favorites, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1946.64s)]
*  depending who side you're on, that's either part of Moldova or a breakaway Republic from Moldova. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1953.28s)]
*  Why is that so interesting? I like Transnistria. I wouldn't put it in a rank like, oh, the better, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1958.3200000000002s)]
*  one of the best countries in terms of hospitality. But I, as a traveler, who is obviously trying to [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1965.52s)]
*  also collect the difficult stamps in his collection, then of course, breakaway Republics, they are like [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1970.56s)]
*  a very precious price, you know. And they may not be here for much longer. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1977.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So you'll have to go there if you can. That was the same case with Somaliland [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1981.12s)]
*  in the last African trip. But the special thing about Transnistria, I think it was bizarre, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1984.72s)]
*  the place in itself, I mean, it's the only place in the world, I guess, where you can order sushi [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1989.6799999999998s)]
*  and sit down in a restaurant to eat sushi only 100 meters away from a Lenin statue, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=1995.6s)]
*  which is still standing. So I think it embodies a lot of contradictions in itself. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2001.1999999999998s)]
*  Now here's a question I also asked Chris Blattman. I asked Charles Simon. If we think about the new [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2006.1599999999999s)]
*  world, it seems to me that systematically a lot of countries in the new world are much more dangerous [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2012.32s)]
*  than countries in the other hemisphere. If you think about Colombia earlier on, not so much now, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2017.44s)]
*  you think about murder rates in Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, many parts of Brazil. There does seem [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2023.04s)]
*  to be a difference in the level of violence, gun deaths in the United States compared to, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2029.6000000000001s)]
*  say, Western Europe. Why is this? It's not just one country. There's something about the new world [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2034.64s)]
*  that makes some significant parts of it more violent. What is that? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2039.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, probably because in our evolution as territories, we have had violins as a part of [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2042.64s)]
*  it much more recently in the timeline. I mean, we were conquered by means of powder. So I think [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2050.32s)]
*  that's probably in the genetic of our culture. I guess not. I hope not. But it's interesting what [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2055.84s)]
*  you said about the shootings here in the US. It's something that, of course, as an outsider [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  and as someone who is its first visit to the country, it would be not proper to give a very [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2065.6800000000003s)]
*  deep reflection on that. But I'm going back to the hitchhiking issue. There's some sort of relation [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2071.2s)]
*  I think I can establish. I think when you hitchhike, you are trying to establish social links [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2079.68s)]
*  with random people. But then I feel that in a very developed society like the US, where people have [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2087.2s)]
*  been, how to say, the people that the value of independence has been stressed over interdependence [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2094.0s)]
*  too much and much more than in Latin America, for example, or even in Europe. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2101.6s)]
*  And then I feel that when you are absolutely independent and you don't need help from your [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2105.84s)]
*  neighbors, then also no one is needing your help. So then how do you feel that you are needful for [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2110.16s)]
*  your community? I think that we are losing that probably something happening here that some people, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2118.32s)]
*  just some people, don't have the chance to show, demonstrate their value to the community. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2123.44s)]
*  And this kind of leads to social anomie. Yes, anomie. And that may be the case when you have [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2127.68s)]
*  someone climbing to the roof of a building and shooting people. That's the best answer to the [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2135.52s)]
*  question I've heard so far. Consider the South American nation of Chile. Now there's a semi-famous, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2140.64s)]
*  you might call it rivalry between Argentina and Chile. And if you're hitchhiking in Chile, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2145.84s)]
*  I love hitchhiking in Chile, actually. It's a beautiful country. A Chilean driver picks you up. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2151.12s)]
*  Do you in any way feel that rivalry when you connect with him and he learns you're from [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2156.08s)]
*  Argentina, hears that you're from Argentina, or is that just not at all present? No, actually, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2160.88s)]
*  no. First, I love hitchhiking in Chile. It has a very low waiting time as well. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2165.6s)]
*  They know this rarely. Actually, it never happened. People are really, really like, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2169.92s)]
*  I remember being in a hiking, some kind of hiking refuge deep in the mountains in Chile, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2175.44s)]
*  but there was a road and then a truck came. And Laura and I were camping inside this little hut. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2182.48s)]
*  And the truck driver stopped and gave us, they took a cooking kitchen and started cooking food [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2187.52s)]
*  for us because we had been under the rain for a couple of days. Now people, I really had nice [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2193.2000000000003s)]
*  experiences in Chile. But even if we are talking about supposed rivalries, I once got a ride with [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2198.96s)]
*  a guy who was from the Malvinas or the Falkland Islands. The guy used to be the coach of the [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2205.12s)]
*  soccer team of the Malvinas, of the Falklands. And the interesting thing was, okay, it's the first [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2210.88s)]
*  time I see a guy from the Malvinas in person. We are supposed to kill each other. And then he was [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2217.04s)]
*  also like, oh, Argentina. Okay. What do we do now? And we were in a car. We were in Britain. And so [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2223.3599999999997s)]
*  the first thing, say, hey, would you enjoy, would you have a pint? Yeah, let's go. We stopped the [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2229.12s)]
*  car. We drink. We drink our problems away. It was a way of healing individually the problems of our [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2233.28s)]
*  countries. And I like that. Where is the food the best? Food. I actually like a lot in the Balkans [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2240.32s)]
*  where people, because I like the Balkans because it's Europe, but it has a lot of Ottoman influence, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  which means they are having fresh ingredients in their food. It's a priority for them, the way they [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2253.92s)]
*  have this breakfast with olive and this yogurt, but naturally processed yogurt. And so I like that [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2260.4s)]
*  because nowadays you have genetically modified food. Everything you can get in the store is [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2268.0s)]
*  poisoned and stuff like that. And I like this middle point that Bulgaria and Albania. Macedonia [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2274.08s)]
*  is for me the best food in the Balkans. Macedonia, yeah. Not far from there. Definitely. All the [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2281.6s)]
*  region, I think. Romania, definitely. Yeah, I like that. Which country has the most beautiful women? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2285.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I should go for Lithuania. The most beautiful men. I don't have an opinion for that. Okay. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2290.4s)]
*  The knowledge one gains from travel. It's very strong. It's far-reaching. It makes one more [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2298.2400000000002s)]
*  cosmopolitan. Maybe instills some wisdom in us. But what biases does it bring to us? Just as people [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2303.36s)]
*  who don't travel have biases. If you've traveled a lot, what biases are you likely to end up with [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2309.52s)]
*  that you need to guard against precisely because you've traveled so much? Let's say it's a hard [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2314.2400000000002s)]
*  question to answer, actually. Advice is something you are conditioned by your trip. You mean, and [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2319.6s)]
*  then you kind of... Things you take for granted, let's say. You start taking new things for granted. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2324.48s)]
*  Probably, yeah. That's the thing, probably. When you just go to a country and the people are just [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2328.64s)]
*  ticking off the bucket list things just like sightseeing. Probably I've seen like 100 Buddhist [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2333.68s)]
*  temples already and ruins and that. So yeah, I feel that that makes me focus much more on very, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2339.12s)]
*  very specific things or on people and not on sightseeing and stuff like that. But that as a [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2346.3199999999997s)]
*  traveler, I mean, but in other areas. I couldn't recall now. Probably there are, but... Do you think [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2352.24s)]
*  travel makes people more conservative? I don't mean that in the political sense of any party, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2357.8399999999997s)]
*  but conservative in the literal, adjectival sense that you've seen many different ways of life. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2362.9599999999996s)]
*  You see that in different ways they can work or many people can be happy within them. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2368.3199999999997s)]
*  And tolerance is one half of that, but a kind of conservatism or acceptance is another part. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2373.3599999999997s)]
*  You think that's a bias of travel, a benefit of travel? Not the case. You mean like if you... Okay, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2378.64s)]
*  you have seen like a lot of countries in which people are striving to get to make a living. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2384.3199999999997s)]
*  And then you mean that that would cost you to accept that? That you've seen the possibility [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2390.3199999999997s)]
*  that people can be happy in many different settings. Yeah, I think that definitely makes you [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2396.3199999999997s)]
*  stronger in the sense that it helps you to be happier with less, I think. And also it helps you [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2401.2s)]
*  to not take for granted what you have at home. Because when we were in Africa the last year, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2409.2799999999997s)]
*  and then Norway had a tap on his house where they would just switch it and have running water. They [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2413.2s)]
*  would have to walk to the next little river. Normally it was the women doing that, and they [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2418.7999999999997s)]
*  would have to walk like one mile to get a big full load of water to their house. And we all have taps [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2423.44s)]
*  with running water. So it really helps you not to take things for granted. While preparing for [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2430.16s)]
*  this talk, I looked up quotations about travel. I like to do that. Okay. And I was shocked at how [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2436.24s)]
*  ordinary or banal all of them were. Travel opens your horizons, travel makes you a new person. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2441.8399999999997s)]
*  Or you will be true, but they seem so trite and uninteresting. So I guess a question I have for [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2448.24s)]
*  you is what is it about travel that no one else will tell us? What is it about travel that... [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2453.3599999999997s)]
*  Getting has to try it in the banal, which may well be true. What will no one else tell us? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2458.88s)]
*  I think the problem is that traveling, and even our role as bloggers, has fallen for some people [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2463.84s)]
*  only into promoting destinations. And you fall into the touristic aspect of it. While I try to [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2470.08s)]
*  enhance and stress the way travel can change the way you relate to the whole planet. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2476.96s)]
*  And this has also a responsibility because the more you travel and the more you get out of the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  abstract tax and the more you're able to relate to real people, then you start feeling empathy [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2492.48s)]
*  for real people from Colombia, Albania, Iraq, wherever. And then you're less prone to subscribe [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2497.68s)]
*  to any or to vote to the wrong government in your home country, which is then going to declare war [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2502.7999999999997s)]
*  or sanctions on these countries. So I think traveling has this little twist that can [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2507.8399999999997s)]
*  make you a more aware person and then you have this responsibility of transmitting this at home [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2514.2400000000002s)]
*  and in your... at whatever... in your own levels of influence. So I think that's the most interesting [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  potential traveling has. If you're going to visit a new country or region where you've never been, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2526.56s)]
*  other than simply going, what kind of preparation do you do in advance? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2531.84s)]
*  Yeah, the fact that I hitchhike doesn't mean that I leave everything at random. So people [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2535.76s)]
*  sometimes tend to think that I will just land there and start hitchhiking randomly in any direction, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2539.36s)]
*  which is not the case. So let's say I always travel by hitchhiking. That's like a rule. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2544.1600000000003s)]
*  But of course, I always read a lot about the country, about its history, and I try to identify [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2550.32s)]
*  regions, regions that have their own identity within that country. Because that's normally [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2554.48s)]
*  the case. If you go to Ethiopia and then you have the Omo Valley and then you have the highlands, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2561.1200000000003s)]
*  everything changes between each region. So I try to read a lot of history about the country. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2566.4s)]
*  But then I would stick to my standard approach, which is choosing small roads, minor roads, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2570.8s)]
*  and visiting random towns along them. And that would be my average strategy of trying to [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2576.8s)]
*  get to the stories and to the people. Now in two weeks, I'm going to Ethiopia for 11 days. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2583.84s)]
*  Given that you've been there and done some research, what advice or tips would you give me [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2589.12s)]
*  for my trip? For Ethiopia and for 11 days. 11 days. So I'll have some time, not enough time [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2593.2s)]
*  to go around the whole country. I think I would definitely stick to the north, which is like the [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2597.9199999999996s)]
*  place where you have like Gondar, which used to be the imperial seat of power of the kings, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2604.3199999999997s)]
*  of the emperors, of the Ethiopian emperors. I would go to Gondar to see the castles and to understand [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2610.0s)]
*  all this history and lineage of the Ethiopian empire. I would definitely put Lalibella, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2614.56s)]
*  you know, the rock carved churches, the underground churches of Lalibella, which is something amazing, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2621.36s)]
*  you know, that you should actually be there on a Sunday because then you can, even doesn't matter [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2628.56s)]
*  your religious position, you should go and witness a mass service there. Yeah, I think Lalibella, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2633.68s)]
*  Gondar, the monasteries in Bajardar. And conceptually, what should I understand about the [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2641.04s)]
*  country and its cultures that maybe I don't know right now, never having been? Oh, get ready. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2645.52s)]
*  Get ready for Ethiopia. It has been one of the most difficult countries for me to hitchhike. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2651.6s)]
*  But if you're going to be there 11 days and if you will be, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2655.84s)]
*  we'll have some things already organized. I will use plane tickets rather than hitchhiking. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2658.48s)]
*  Okay. So then you will not be hit so much, but you will be hit. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2662.32s)]
*  Hit by what? People in Ethiopia. You know, it's not so huge country with 90 million people. It's a bit [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2666.8s)]
*  crowded. And I felt that they had a history. I mean, Ethiopian is a very interesting case [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2674.48s)]
*  because they combine the proud of an empire. I mean, they're so proud. The empire has never been [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2681.12s)]
*  beaten or conquest, just leaving aside six hours of Italian presence during the second world war. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2685.92s)]
*  But besides that, they had never been conquered and they have their proudest like so much there [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2691.44s)]
*  up, you know, when we went to Kenya after Ethiopia, we were telling Ethiopians our next step. They said, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2696.0s)]
*  oh, you're going to Africa. Oh, they're so different from us. You know, like we are Ethiopians [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2701.04s)]
*  and they consider themselves like a different lineage. So you should be ready for that in [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2704.96s)]
*  contradiction with all the poverty they have. So it's like this mix of so staunch, proud people [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2711.36s)]
*  with a very, very challenging present. They're not able to identify it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2717.68s)]
*  I have a few questions about Argentina, if I may. Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2721.68s)]
*  The elites of Argentina, wealthy, highly educated people, do they understand their own country? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2724.88s)]
*  Or are they insulated and removed from it? No, no, I think they are. They understand, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2730.56s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that they can feel empathy for them or that they want to do something to [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2736.7999999999997s)]
*  improve it. I mean, of course they know who are they governing, you know, but they are so far [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2741.2s)]
*  away from it. Our country is an interesting case in Latin America because it's composed of a high [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2746.16s)]
*  percentage of people who descends from European migrations. So same scenarios in the United States. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2751.52s)]
*  I mean, probably if you were European in the 19th century and you wanted to emigrate, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2757.52s)]
*  your choices were New York or Buenos Aires. The most probable place would be those. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2762.4s)]
*  Probably Australia as well. But in the rest of Latin America, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2769.44s)]
*  so that made Argentina very complex, demographically speaking. So then we have a [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2773.44s)]
*  lot of provinces which are far, like a world away from the standard of living of Buenos Aires, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2778.56s)]
*  like, you know, the North and the far North and definitely our elites just don't get there. And [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2783.36s)]
*  that's the areas of the country where development never reaches there. Why is Argentina today not as [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2787.6800000000003s)]
*  wealthy as Australia? As you probably know, it was in the 1920s. Yeah, yeah, it was. It used to be [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2794.6400000000003s)]
*  like in the top 10 richest countries in the world. And that's actually why my grandparents, no, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2799.52s)]
*  actually my grandparents, when they're in the 1920s, like I still have the ship ticket, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2803.6800000000003s)]
*  the steam ship ticket. Where did they leave from? Italy. What part? They came from Sicily. Yeah. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2809.68s)]
*  But normally they would take the ship from Genoa, which is like the standard place where you would [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2815.12s)]
*  board the ship. And actually my family's half Italian, the same as most, like probably 50% [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  of people in Argentina. That's like the average case. Sorry, your question was why we're not as [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2825.9199999999996s)]
*  rich as Australia. Yeah, I think there was a turn in the, I mean, in our history, somewhere in the [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2831.52s)]
*  late sixties, yeah. Well, the military governments really had an economic agenda, which was not set [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2838.48s)]
*  by our own people, but by international entities, you know, such as the IMF and the World Bank. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2846.08s)]
*  So I think we owe a big deal to that for like changing the tide. To what extent do you understand [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2854.32s)]
*  Argentina as being a kind of Italian country or offshoot rather than Hispanic in the sense that [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2861.92s)]
*  we might consider much of the rest of Latin America? I think the richness of the country [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2867.6s)]
*  relies on actually on the complexity because you couldn't say Argentina is an European country. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2872.16s)]
*  We have an important percentage of the population who descends from Europeans, but we all the people, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2877.44s)]
*  these people also mix with the original inhabitants of our land. No, I think it happens similarly [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2884.0s)]
*  in the U S in the way that you also had your original people living here, which were gradually [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2891.2s)]
*  moved west. And well then, you know, it happened with us in Argentina, the same that happened here. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2896.08s)]
*  Most of their culture was erased, but those who stayed, they, you know, they, they combine and [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2901.7599999999998s)]
*  they made the society we have today. So it's definitely a mix and it's not like a European [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2909.12s)]
*  country. Though some people like to see at us, oh, we are a elite, we are different, we are better, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2914.48s)]
*  which is different, but we're not better. Are you optimistic about Argentina? I think we have [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2919.68s)]
*  survived so many crisis that I think we still have the, the woods for to, to stand in new, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2924.48s)]
*  actually now that as we talk now, there's a huge climate of uncertainty and the exchange rate with [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2930.72s)]
*  the dollar has switched like 10% in two, in two days. But yeah, this is May we're speaking in, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2937.2s)]
*  it fell about 10% last week for the listeners, but you're, you are optimistic. I think I'm [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2942.96s)]
*  optimistic in the, in the long run, but not in the present government we have now. I'm not [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2947.6s)]
*  optimistic at all about the present, the government we have now. Are you optimistic about [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2951.92s)]
*  Pope Francis? Well, the church hasn't really changed in like 2000 years, you know, I think [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2956.48s)]
*  they just hold a romantic and symbolic position. So I don't see, they're not fighting any battle. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2961.6s)]
*  I can ostensibly see. So I kind of be, I don't know over what I have to be optimistic or not. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2967.44s)]
*  I just find it funny that we have a Pope from our country, but. Who's your favorite author [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2974.2400000000002s)]
*  from Argentina and why? I like two others actually, which people tend to consider [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2979.36s)]
*  contradictory. One is Julio Cortázar, which I love, especially how to translate Rajuela. Hopscotch. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2986.08s)]
*  Hopscotch. Yes. One of my favorite novels. Definitely. I love Hopscotch and the other [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=2992.7200000000003s)]
*  writer is Borges. Those are also my two favorites from your country. Yeah. I like the way they, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3001.2000000000003s)]
*  they just compliment each other. I like Cortázar because he mixes the intellectual game of writing [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3007.28s)]
*  with the very bohemian sense of his lifestyle in when he was in Paris. So that probably inspired [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3014.32s)]
*  me a lot when taking the decision to live as a wandering artist. And if you had to tell a [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3020.96s)]
*  person who had traveled a lot, understood something about the world, but they had never been to [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3026.96s)]
*  Argentina before and they had two weeks, how would you outline the ideal trip through Argentina [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3031.76s)]
*  for them and what should they not miss other than the obvious? So yes, they go to Buenas Artes, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3036.4s)]
*  they go to Iguazú, but what else? Yeah, that's the thing. Everyone wants to take the list, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3041.36s)]
*  the bucket list. So probably I would have the glaciers, the Perito Moreno glaciers in the south [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3045.84s)]
*  because Patagonia is an extensive place full of wonderful scenarios, but definitely you should [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3050.48s)]
*  at least eat an asado, our barbecues, which we call asado. That's a typical Argentinian experience. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3057.12s)]
*  And where is that best in the country? Yeah. You have to meet local friends and do it on a Sunday [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3063.6s)]
*  with local people. I mean, you can go to a restaurant and ask for the best steak they can [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3069.2799999999997s)]
*  produce, but you're going to just be seated there in a restaurant alone. But there's a whole social [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3075.44s)]
*  ritual around preparing the barbecue, the asado. And that's something that will make you understand [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3080.3199999999997s)]
*  a lot of things about Argentinian culture, people speaking about soccer results and so on, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3085.92s)]
*  politics. And so yeah, that should be something that shouldn't be missed. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3091.2000000000003s)]
*  And what's the best place to visit in the north of Argentina? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3094.7200000000003s)]
*  In the north. So definitely, I love the northwest, which is also the grounds in which randomly I [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3097.6s)]
*  happen to take the decision of becoming nomadic. So it's Salta province in the Calchaquí valleys. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3104.96s)]
*  That's where in 2002, I kind of had this insight and I said, okay, yeah, I should do, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3110.7999999999997s)]
*  I should go for this, you know. You think of your own future for yourself. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3115.2s)]
*  What is it you're planning next? Okay. You mean the short term or [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3119.92s)]
*  in the start with the short term? So the short term, I think like, I just keep doing what I'm [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3122.72s)]
*  doing now. As I said, like, so you will write more books and take more long trips. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3128.64s)]
*  That's something that is definitely going to happen. I think like the next move is trying to [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3134.24s)]
*  make the books available in the US or in the UK, because I feel that's a place where the books are [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3140.7999999999997s)]
*  necessary even more than in my home country, because that's where decisions are being made. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3147.44s)]
*  And that's my whole concept of travel literature is to try to change people's views and have, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3152.64s)]
*  and make them have empathy and also affect the decisions they take in life. So I would, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3157.92s)]
*  you know, that would be like my next big challenge to get published in the US. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3163.36s)]
*  But as regards lifestyle, I think we'll continue making long trips and publishing books. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3167.36s)]
*  That for sure. Yeah. And in the longer term, what is next for you? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3175.84s)]
*  In the longer term, I think it's, it's, you know, that when I made this decision of traveling [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3179.76s)]
*  for life, one of the things I was afraid was of course, this economic stability. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3185.52s)]
*  Yes. People were asking me, okay, but what are you going to do in the long run? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3189.76s)]
*  Okay, you can do this because you're young, but what are you going to do with when you are 40, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3193.36s)]
*  and the things I'm already 40, but they were asking me this when I was 20. And they were [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3197.36s)]
*  forecasting, oh, when you're 30, you are going to understand, you should have kids and this. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3201.44s)]
*  And then I turned 30 and now it's our 40 and I keep doing the same stuff. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3204.7200000000003s)]
*  I think Oscar Wilde say that the only way not to, not to get old was to continue repeating the same [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3208.4s)]
*  mistakes. So he will be proud of me. But when I took this decision, I kind of imagined, okay, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3215.76s)]
*  what's the worst possible scenario? What can the worst happen to me? And in that time, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3222.0s)]
*  my books were not like they are now. They were handmade photocopy books, just a bunch of A4 [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3227.28s)]
*  size paper, papers stapled together, and I would sell them around in bars and hostels. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3232.24s)]
*  And I would, I just decided, okay, if it kind of get worse than that, I mean, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3237.68s)]
*  if the worst possible scenarios, I would be like a old hippie going around Southeast Asia, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3242.8s)]
*  sharing inspiration with the younger travelers and making a living out of it. Welcome. I mean, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3249.12s)]
*  I can go for that. It would look nice in my biography. So after that, then I never again [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3253.6800000000003s)]
*  had like, I know, fears of the future retirement. Obviously you're managing to persist as it is, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3258.2400000000002s)]
*  but do you ever think how your business model might evolve over time? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3264.4s)]
*  It evolved a lot already, actually. Tell us. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3267.6s)]
*  So as I said, this started as a photocopy books, just like 50 to 100 pages. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3270.0s)]
*  Like when I published, well, publish is a very generous word for going to a photocopy place [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3277.36s)]
*  and ordering 50 copies of this. We're all publishing. We write blogs, right? Everything [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3282.96s)]
*  is publishing. So when I first wrote the book, I had just finished my two-year trips from Ireland [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3286.56s)]
*  across Middle East and Iran, Afghanistan, and I arrived to Southeast Asia. I took a rest there. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3291.52s)]
*  I made a pause and started writing the book. The first format, it was like 100 pages photocopy book, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3296.56s)]
*  and I would walk around the streets of Bangkok and the beaches in Thailand to sell it to other [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3302.48s)]
*  travelers. And when I came back to Argentina, I decided to try to get it published properly. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3306.48s)]
*  So the first thing I did was like expanding the book to like 200 pages, go to a printing place. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3312.4s)]
*  So it wasn't photocopied anymore, but I was still like, you know, self publishing and [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3319.52s)]
*  selling it in person. And then like over the time, so I was invited to a book fair with my own [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3323.52s)]
*  self-published books. And I managed to sell a lot of books because I was, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3329.92s)]
*  there was a bookstore that had a little space and I was with my backpack and a big world map showing [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3336.64s)]
*  my route. It was very curious, you know, and I had my Afghan hat with me. So the first thing people [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3342.8s)]
*  would see when they entered the book fair was this weird guy with an Afghan hat and a backpack [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3347.6s)]
*  selling these little books. So it was a success. And then the big publishing houses from Buenos [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3352.32s)]
*  Aires noticed that, okay, which was the best selling book in Marte Plata's book fair? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3357.6s)]
*  What's this? Hitchhiking Decks of Evil. Who is this guy? I mean, he doesn't even have a publisher. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3362.3199999999997s)]
*  So then I was published by Del Nuevo Extremo and RBI publishing houses in Argentina and Spain, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3366.72s)]
*  respectively. And I stayed with them like seven years. But during those seven years, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3374.48s)]
*  social media really changed, you know, the way artists can promote their products. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3379.2s)]
*  So in Argentina, at least I decided to, even though I had contracts to publish my second book, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3384.7999999999997s)]
*  which was Caminos Invisibles or Invisible Roots, even though I had offers, Laura and I decided to [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3390.4799999999996s)]
*  self-publish it because people could directly ask the book from us. So we didn't need a middleman. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3396.16s)]
*  That is effective for like a middle-sized market like Argentina, but probably wouldn't be the case [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3402.7999999999997s)]
*  like in the US or the UK or countries which are not like my stronghold for followers. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3408.9599999999996s)]
*  But that really changed a lot. Like really the decision of switching from published books with [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3414.0s)]
*  a large publishing house to self-publishing through social media afforded us to have like a better [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3420.3199999999997s)]
*  standard of living. That was definitely the case. But now it's again the term of finding a partner [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3428.88s)]
*  in a publishing house if we want to expand to new markets. Could you imagine doing a big long trip [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3434.08s)]
*  through the United States and maybe Canada or is that logistically too difficult and too expensive [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3438.56s)]
*  because hitchhiking was much more popular here say in the 1960s than it is today? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3443.36s)]
*  No, I think it would be definitely possible. Like people tend to think, which is normal of course, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3448.0s)]
*  that the more expensive a country is, then the most difficult or expensive it would be to travel [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3453.84s)]
*  there. But the interesting thing is that for example in a country like Norway, which is [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3459.68s)]
*  more expensive than the US. Sure, much more. Yeah, I think there I have my record. I only spent [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3465.6s)]
*  $30 in 22 days because I think also in these kind of countries, first of all like food in [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3470.7200000000003s)]
*  supermarkets is never expensive and then you normally always receive help from people and [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3477.52s)]
*  people also because they have hitchhiked before or they have heard about it. So it's not even [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3482.96s)]
*  necessarily related with the fact that they still hitchhike or not because no one else is hitchhiking [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3488.4s)]
*  nowadays, like Norway or even here, even though here it's part of the culture let's say in the [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3493.92s)]
*  60s. But I think it would definitely be doable. And after you leave here Arlington, Virginia, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3499.28s)]
*  what is your very next country other than Argentina? Okay, so my next planned trip you mean? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3505.92s)]
*  Yes. I think in the long, well not long term, but next year we want to go back to Africa because [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3510.88s)]
*  we really love Africa. Where? Tanzania. Yes. Yeah, that was the place. But I think now I would like [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3516.7200000000003s)]
*  to do, there's a trip I would like to do to a place called Kaliningrad, which is a Russian [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3523.36s)]
*  exclave in the mainland Europe. Königsberg, it used to be called in German. That's where [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3528.56s)]
*  Ronald Kant lived. That's where Kant lived, exactly. I've always wanted to go there. Exactly, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3533.76s)]
*  it's on my list. And what I want to do is actually to get 19th century maps in order to go from like [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3537.28s)]
*  Berlin to Königsberg or Kaliningrad following the road of old towns which used to have German names, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3542.7200000000003s)]
*  but now they have Lithuanian, Polish or Russian names. And to see what is left from that time. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3548.48s)]
*  I have seen there are like ruined palaces and ruined Lutheran churches. So I want to check that [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3552.96s)]
*  out and I want to play with this thing of traveling with a 19th century map. That sounds wonderful. My [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3557.76s)]
*  very last question, totally obscure, but tell me why should I visit Suriname? I've long been curious, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3563.52s)]
*  but what exactly is there that I will find of interest? Suriname, you've been there. I haven't. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3569.52s)]
*  I said it's beginning. I envy you. And that's one reason why. Okay, so Suriname is a must, I think, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3574.0s)]
*  for any person who wants to explore a present destination. I mean, if you want to explore a [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3579.84s)]
*  place in nowadays world, everything is explored, but Suriname is a place. First of all, people in [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3585.84s)]
*  South America don't even know anything about Suriname. And the amazing thing is they are [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3591.28s)]
*  probably the only Hindu country in South America. A huge percentage of their population descends from [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3596.32s)]
*  people who were brought as a cheap labor force from either Java by the Dutch or by the British [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3602.8s)]
*  from India. So the people from India, they brought their religion with them. Some of them are Muslim, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3610.32s)]
*  but some of them are also Hindu. So you are traveling on the main road in Suriname and you [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3617.76s)]
*  would see 20 feet tall statue of Shiva, you know, and then you will arrive to a town and people are [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3622.2400000000002s)]
*  eating, having a Japanese food. So it's a definitely melting pot of places that you wouldn't [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3627.76s)]
*  expect in South America. Again, I'm with Juan Pablo Villarino or Juan Pablo Villarino. He's the author [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3635.84s)]
*  of four books, most notably Hitchhiking in the Axis of Evil. Juan Pablo, thank you very much. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrzEIAig80&t=3642.6400000000003s)]
