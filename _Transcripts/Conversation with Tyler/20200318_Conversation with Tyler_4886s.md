# Russ Roberts and Tyler Cowen on COVID-19 (recorded live March 18, 2020)
**Conversation with Tyler:** [March 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xlzU_8e0Mk)
*  Okay, welcome everybody. Today is March 18th, 2020. This is a special edition of Econ Talk
*  to be released more or less simultaneously with conversations with Tyler. And that's
*  because my guest, co-conspirator in this conversation is longtime Econ Talk guest Tyler Cowen of
*  George Mason University. We're streaming this live on the YouTube channel of the Mercatus
*  Center of George Mason. Now in general, I try not to do timely episodes, but somehow
*  something felt different this week. For one, I felt an urge to connect with my audience
*  as we all are hunkering down, sheltering in place, self-quarantining, self-isolating.
*  I'm releasing Econ Talk episodes every Monday and they were recorded weeks and weeks ago,
*  which is the way I like to do it because there's nothing particularly timely usually in what
*  I release. But this seemed that there was a lot to talk and think about. And Tyler, you
*  are a self-described infavor. You're such a creative thinker. I want to try to learn
*  from you about where we are and to share my thoughts when possible about where I think
*  we are and to try to learn from each other and hope that that's of some value to those
*  of you listening out there. I want to start on a personal note. My father passed away
*  on March 2nd of this month, March 2nd of this year, a little over two weeks ago. The last
*  eight days of his life, he was on a ventilator and we removed him from that contraption and
*  he lived for about an hour with his family in the room. It was a very powerful moment.
*  But I think that probably colored some of my reaction to this crisis when it started
*  to ramp up. My dad had pneumonia. He had MERS. At that point, he had a bad lung. And I'm
*  starting to look at the data as they come out and I'm looking at the China data and
*  it says, you know, if you're 60 to 69 and I'm 65, you got a 5% chance of dying in that
*  early data if you get the virus. And that's a pretty high, I don't think there's anything
*  I do that has a 5% chance of death in my daily life or if there is, I need to find out and
*  stop doing it. So I think my original reaction, you know, plus the melancholy mood I was in
*  the natural tendency for media to over hype things. On Sunday when I reached out to Tyler
*  was in a pretty anxious state, felt an urge to encourage people to self-isolate. I got
*  back on Twitter at that point. I'd been back on Twitter for a little bit after my father
*  passed away and just was in a very bleak and crisis-oriented mood. I'm in a much more relaxed
*  mood now. We'll talk about that. But I want to just mention that because I think a lot of our
*  reactions to this are colored by our own personal experience. So tell me where you're at.
*  Well, first of all, Russ, my condolences for your father. I know he was very important to you
*  and a very sad event. So we're all with you and your family at this moment.
*  Thank you. Thank you.
*  I've been hunkered down at home every day with some quick trips outside, typically to use the
*  printer at work or maybe to refresh some grocery supplies as quickly as I can. But I wake up,
*  I move to my sofa, I get into information absorption mode and just let it rip until it's
*  time to go to bed at night. And I've been blogging and writing about this the whole time and really
*  not doing very much else, although I am spending more time cooking. So what I see as the data come
*  in is we ought to have greater concern as to the possible risks here for this being a very
*  large scale negative event. I'm not sure my personal mood has changed that much,
*  but I am taking this more and more seriously. Does that make sense?
*  Yeah. And I want to confess another personal matter, which is that
*  I work from home every day. The only difference really in my life right now is that
*  I have my two sons home from college and my wife who teaches high school math will be
*  after our session is done, Tyler, she'll take our broadband and use it to teach online to her class.
*  As well as to my law class, yes.
*  So when I encourage people to self-isolate, which I did in the early beginning as a response to what
*  I felt was a not much of a governmental response initially, I felt there's a lot we could do
*  to reduce risk individually and voluntarily. So I was encouraging people to do that,
*  being aware of the fact that for me, it's not much of a burden. I mean, the whole crisis for me right
*  now other than anxiety and worries about the future of the country and death of my loved ones
*  who are even older than I am and other people's loved ones, the main effect is that on Friday,
*  I impulsively went to Costco, which was better than Sunday, I think, and spent an hour waiting
*  to check out. It was really a fascinating cultural experience. The lines went to the back of the store
*  and then snaked around a little bit. There was plenty of stuff on the shelves, except for maybe
*  toilet paper. I think everything else was pretty much in stock, but it's not a hard burden for me.
*  I think it's just important to say that upfront. It's not hard for me to work from home. I have no
*  financial worries in this crisis, and I think it's important to try to remember that other
*  people are not like us. That's a good rule generally, but it's especially important, I think,
*  right now. I agree with that, but I think it will become hard for you most likely and hard
*  for virtually everyone. So imagine keeping on doing what you're doing through some greater
*  number of months, imposing similar restrictions on your family, having to make some number of
*  fairly stressful decisions along the way. Let's talk again in June how hard or easy this is,
*  right? So we're used to going outside and interacting with people face to face.
*  Not so much, though. Mostly we're being cut off from that.
*  Yeah. I'm instituting, I think Skype Coffee is a really good thing. I recommend that to everybody,
*  people you might normally have coffee with. Get a cup of coffee and sit on Skype or Zoom and
*  chat with them that way. It's not so bad. It's not great, but it's not so bad.
*  What are you doing to get into that quarantine state of mind, if I may ask?
*  What do you mean by that?
*  The understanding that it may be really some period of time before you were able to resume
*  normal movements and interactions. Any given day it may seem fine, but what mental readjustment
*  are you making? For me, the things that I'm anxious about, I usually spend the summer in
*  California. I wonder if that's going to be possible. My son's getting married in August
*  in Australia. That seems uncertain. A good friend of mine's son was scheduled to be married. They
*  just postponed the wedding. So those kind of things weigh on me a little bit. The way I try to
*  deal with that for me is it's just an adventure. I don't mean to minimize it. It's just part
*  of the incredible experience of life that we have this experience together with my two sons who are
*  home, with my wife. This is just something that we get to experience. I try to look at it that way.
*  I don't know what's going to happen. It's obviously going to have cultural, social, economic,
*  and political implications, which I hope we'll talk about. Here's the hardest part.
*  I was talking to somebody yesterday about this who's worried about her aging parents. I'm worried
*  about my 87-year-old mom who just lost her husband. I'm not as worried about this as I
*  am for a lot of reasons. I think the challenge is you're not in charge. Most of my life I'm in
*  charge. I love that feeling. The acceptance of the idea that you can't control your mom's
*  safety and you can't control when your son's wedding will actually be is just hard to deal
*  with. I'm not used to that. I don't like that feeling. For me, it's trying to cope with that.
*  How about you? With that in mind, I've tried to stay as busy as possible. In fact, I don't think
*  I've ever been busier in my entire life. Reading materials, writing, passing along advice,
*  just processing information, every day feels like an enormous rush of things I have to do,
*  even though in the sense of my physical surroundings it's quite static.
*  I think that's given me maybe an illusory sense of control, but it's made it bearable for me.
*  Again, I don't think my personal mood has changed that much other than just feeling much, much busier.
*  About a week ago, my wife was a little concerned with how focused I was on the whole issue.
*  I realized that's just the way I deal with it. That's part of my anxiety control mechanism.
*  I think my human reaction to it, and it sounds like it's yours too.
*  One striking fact about all of these events is I think it really drives home the difficulty for
*  people of thinking in exponential terms. You and I have both talked about the importance of economic
*  growth, compounding returns over time, having an economy growing at 3% is much, much better over
*  time than having an economy growing at 1%. How hard it is for people to grasp that,
*  that's old news to the two of us. Here we have a totally new event where by some estimates the
*  number of actual cases is doubling, say, every five to seven days. In many parts of the country
*  or world, it right now doesn't actually quote unquote look that terrible. There are many
*  people who have coronavirus, but no symptoms, and they'll probably just be fine. Nonetheless,
*  if something is doubling every five to seven days, some very bad events are not so far away.
*  But because they're not vivid, people, including a lot of economists I know,
*  they're not able to make that mental leap. I think my background with thinking about economic growth
*  is a significant reason why I think I've seen some of the dangers here coming.
*  Well, I'm going to think about that a different way. I, like you, I spend a lot of time thinking
*  about uncertainty and risk and growth linear versus exponential. And I've been struck by how
*  hard it is for me to get my head around this. I was alluding to that earlier. I have relatives
*  who watch Fox News, and they were telling me a week ago, this is just like the flu, maybe eight
*  days ago, 10 days ago. And I lost it. I said, 1.5 million people dying in America is not like the
*  flu. And I was looking at these numbers. Half American, 40 to 70% of Americans will likely get
*  coronavirus, let's say that's half. So that gets you to about 150, 160 million. And quote, 1% will
*  die. That gets you to 1.6 million, presumably extra deaths. So that concentrated the mind
*  wonderfully, or whatever the opposite is. I started to think, we've got to act right now.
*  We've got to spread the word. People are underappreciating it. I think they did for a
*  while. I feel like they've kind of gone back the other way now. I think we have to be very careful
*  right now. I think it's really appropriate, most of the things that everyone's doing,
*  staying at home as much as possible, washing your hands, not touching your face,
*  staying six feet away from people. Those are all crucial over the next two weeks and maybe the next
*  month, maybe longer, we don't know. But I do think there is an apocalyptic reaction to this that is
*  also very natural, that is the opposite of what you're talking about. That people just, they see
*  the curve going like this. They say, we're 10 days behind Italy. I don't think we are. I don't want
*  to be eight days behind Italy or 12 or whatever the right way to think about that is. But I think
*  it's really hard to think about this. I'm not so good at it. I think about it a lot.
*  Steve McLaughlin Keep in mind, this affects the world as a whole. Most countries do not have a
*  public health system as good as ours. Ours is far from the best we're seeing, by the way.
*  We'll get to that. But also, I think it's now becoming fairly clear. There's quite a good
*  chance that soon we will have, say, 20% unemployment. In financial markets, people are hoarding cash.
*  Real interest rates are rising. Even if the Fed supplies as much liquidity as possible,
*  there's a danger that either the liquidity is not deployed or the only way to get it deployed
*  is to have centralized government as a truly major allocator of resources, far beyond anything we've
*  seen so far, almost as if we were on a wartime footing. And the chance of those events happening
*  seems to be rising. So of course, we should take the deaths very seriously. Even many younger people
*  might have some kind of permanent damage to their lungs. We're not sure yet. There
*  seem to be many open questions. But the risks do seem to be rising. And I would include the
*  global front, the economic front. Tensions between the United States and China are much worse than
*  they had been. China is calling it a virus from America. Trump is calling it the Chinese virus.
*  It's even possible that's the single worst outcome of all of these events.
*  So there are many different angles here. I think too many for any person to really take in and
*  follow or grasp. But again, to me, the risks do seem to be rising. Yeah, those other parts,
*  I think, are very relevant, the economic and social pieces, political pieces. Let's focus
*  for a few more minutes on the medical epidemiological side of this before we move on.
*  What are your views? Do you have anything to say about this accusation, which is true,
*  that we've been very slow to roll out testing? A lot of people are arguing South Korea figured
*  this out, solved it. They're basically almost done with this problem. We've been slow to test,
*  and as a result, we've opened up a huge Pandora's box that we can't fix.
*  It's very true that we have been slow to test. Some of that is because of FDA restrictions.
*  Some of that is the administration simply not responding quickly enough. Some of it is reasons
*  that still seem somewhat mysterious as to why we didn't have better tests, Andy. There's a very
*  good article in Wired a few days ago on this. We don't know the full extent of what happened,
*  but I would not be so quick to assume that South Korea or any of the East Asian nations
*  have it under control. There's some very recent data suggesting that the number of cases may be
*  rising in those countries. A downside of controlling it quickly is that you have a very large pool of
*  people who have, in essence, no immunity. Which countries exactly will do how well? I would say
*  we don't know yet. I do think Taiwan and Singapore, most of all, and then South Korea probably have
*  had the best responses, but they are by no means in the clear. The question of how many waves there
*  will be, what kind of immunities are built up, for how long does this stretch? What I'm seeing from
*  informed opinions is just a high degree of uncertainty. I find that worrying. We're in a
*  position where we need really quite a number of particular things to go well for any country to
*  be in the clear. It's just hard to know. I think what people seem to have missed in this testing
*  conversation is that there appears to be an enormous number of false positives. I'm encouraging
*  people not to focus as closely on the caseload as more perhaps on the death count, unfortunately.
*  I assume there's false negatives too, but this idea that people are walking around
*  who are asymptomatic, I'm sure there are some, but I wouldn't be confident it's all the people who
*  have tested positive. My thought, it's hard to have a libertarian moment or a classical liberal
*  moment in these times, but it seemed to me that when the administration and Trump underestimated
*  the seriousness of the problem and downplayed it, which I thought was a terrible mistake,
*  but when they did, people like you and me and others said, hey, this is a real problem.
*  And the private voluntary reaction to the crisis was quite strong. The NBA shut down very quickly.
*  The NCAA shut down very quickly. Baseball shut down very quickly. Nobody had to order folks
*  around. And I think what's been underestimated in this, in the demand for this top-down, fix it,
*  solve it, make everybody whole, don't let anything bad ever happen, we've missed the role that
*  we can play individually. It's going to be very imperfect, of course. People cheat on
*  self-quarantining. I know that. But the idea that we could test perfectly is that that could solve
*  it is unrealistic in a country of 330 million people in our number of square miles. It just
*  seems that the advantage of this bottom-up voluntary response to the crisis is it allows
*  for nuance. The top-down says everything's closed. And that means that there's going to be enormous
*  economic and human results from that that we're just sort of ignoring. The advantage of the
*  private response is it allows for people to be more flexible, to take into account when they can
*  and should, when things are more dangerous for some than others. And I just think that that's
*  been lost in this maelstrom. Maybe I have a different point of view on a number of those
*  points. I'm not sure the rate of false positives is very high. I see papers arguing it both ways.
*  If you look at the cruise ship testing— 50 percent. 50 percent in the one I saw.
*  Well, there may be 50 percent who don't have symptoms and who are just fine. But I don't
*  think there's anything close to 50 percent false positives for tests well done. So if you look at,
*  say, testing in Singapore, I don't think they have anything close to a 50 percent rate of false
*  positives. Might the drive-through tests in South Korea have a much higher false positives rate?
*  Certainly, I would expect that. Even there, we don't know. But I think it's very important
*  to be shutting down as much as we can right now. Agreed. Because with the number of cases rising
*  exponentially, if you're going to apply testing and isolation and giving people ICU care and
*  hospital beds and ventilators, you need for that problem to be manageable in size relative to your
*  health care infrastructure, or you do end up being like Lombardy in North Italy. So we could end up
*  in that position, say, two weeks from now. I'm not sure we have to. But I think the single biggest
*  thing we can do to stop being there, given that the tests are not in our laps at the moment,
*  is just for people to interact with others as little as possible. And it's as if we're trying
*  to put the economy in a coma, to cite an analogy Larry Summers gave. So I think we should be trying
*  to put the economy in a coma. I'm okay with the government doing that. But I think personally,
*  we need to be doing that quicker than what the government is up to.
*  Yeah. I mean, we put it in a lot of things got put in, I would call it a deep freeze,
*  you know, very quickly. Sports being the obvious one. Broadway, I think, followed shortly after
*  that. I think the place where the biggest hole was, you know, bars and restaurants,
*  and the government did that. Most bar and restaurant owners and goers, I don't think
*  particularly were excited about self-regulating there. But certainly, you know, churches,
*  synagogues, mosques, all just very quickly shut down, which is pretty amazing.
*  But plenty have not, right? Plenty of religious ceremonies are still up and running. You can walk
*  around different parts of Virginia and see people intermingling at a large scale. We're not really
*  quite there yet, in my view. Yeah. And 30% of Americans, if you poll them, they say they're
*  not even worried. So there's been a huge failure of communications. Some of that comes from our
*  president. But it's really not just that. There's so many businesses, institutions in the nonprofit
*  world that just have been very, very slow to respond. Yeah, fair enough. And I do think,
*  I think staying home is the single biggest thing we can do right now. And obviously, closing some
*  things through regulation and government is going to make that happen, make it more likely than not.
*  One of my proposals is we should have things that make it more fun for people to be at home.
*  So some of the entertainment companies are having free streaming on cable of some of their back
*  catalog. Maybe that's a marginal effect, but if it saves only a few lives. So whatever we can do
*  so that people are willing or indeed, maybe even in some cases, eager to stay home,
*  making childcare issues easier. If you just think through all the different logistical issues with
*  staying home, it's actually quite complex. And I would like to see our nonprofit sector get on the
*  ball very quickly with delivering supplies to people who need it and who shouldn't be going out
*  or can't get out. And we're starting to solve on this. But on almost all fronts, we're starting way
*  too late. Ideally, we should have been doing this at some point earlier in February.
*  Well, let's move to the more economic side of things. I'm not sure how important those things.
*  I mean, I really like that. Again, I have Amazon Prime, so I have lots of stuff to watch. I have
*  Netflix. I have lots of stuff to watch. But if you don't have those, YouTube has, what, only about a
*  trillion hours of entertainment. I think the stir crazy aspect of this. Now, you're right.
*  You suggested earlier that after six weeks, this might feel differently than it does now.
*  I think the financial side of this for people who are not being able to get to work, can't go to work,
*  is the much bigger issue, obviously. So let's turn to that. So if you said unemployment might be 20%,
*  of course, it's higher than that right now in a real sense, in an unmeasured, non-quantified sense.
*  A lot of people, quote, aren't working. And I would, as I'm sure you would, I'd encourage
*  you to look at employment as opposed to unemployment in the coming weeks and months. But
*  if the economy took a break, if we had announced, if government had announced,
*  irrespective of this virus, that everybody has a forced two-week vacation, everybody goes home for
*  two weeks, stays home. It's good. We're going to have more family time. GDP would go down in
*  those two weeks. If we can measure it in a two-week period, we don't. Some of that would be made up for
*  in the two weeks after, because people would be buying or creating things that weren't made
*  during those two weeks. Some things are not replaceable. The meal out versus the meal in,
*  eating out versus cooking yourself, you don't make that up. Well, you could a little bit.
*  But in general, what are your thoughts on that sort of extreme version of this? That would be a
*  stylized way of thinking about what we're going through now. What would be the impact of that,
*  everybody just stop making stuff for sale, that commercial life stop for two weeks or four weeks?
*  Two, four weeks, those are easy cases. If you think of many service sectors as having to shut down,
*  say until August, which is quite a possible scenario, in some cases even later,
*  that to me is greatly concerning. It may vary across sectors. If you think about the NBA,
*  whenever the NBA is ready to play games again, you know the players will show up the next day
*  and they'll be ready. That will come back very quickly. But if you think of small businesses,
*  say restaurants, the big chains aside, they're typically thinly capitalized. Let's say a
*  significant portion of those are gone forever. Then when things are somewhat normal again,
*  how does the economy re-scramble and reconstitute the organizational capital that was in those
*  ongoing enterprises? That to me is a hugely difficult problem. Whatever you think the
*  government should or should not do, just spending a lot on fiscal stimulus will not ease that
*  problem. That's the actual destruction going on, is the relationships, the organizational capital,
*  the intangibles that will decay, not over two weeks, probably not over four weeks,
*  but over four or five months or longer, then I think that's a matter really of great concern.
*  Well, I'll make a bet with you right now, Todd, that four or five months or now won't look like
*  it does now in terms of the expectations of self-quarantining and self-isolation and
*  things being closed. I think we're going to get to see Tom Brady in a Tampa Bay Buccaneer uniform,
*  for example. On TV, but not with the crowd. Yes, it'll be on TV. In China, they're playing
*  basketball games to be televised and people watch them. But even in China, where the number of new
*  cases is really in most parts of the country genuinely very low, they are not returning with
*  live sporting events. Keep in mind, we will have a pool of never infected people, which will be
*  fairly large in absolute numbers. And what risks we will be willing to take, insurance companies
*  would allow, our liability system and corporate lawyers would be willing to allow. When you think
*  through all of that stickiness, I think we're really not so close to resuming many of these
*  shutdown activities. Yeah, I have a different, I'm a little more optimistic than you, but
*  if you said to me, how do you know? I'd say, ah, it's probably just empty optimism. But you agree
*  there's far too much litigation in American society, right? Far too easy to see people
*  for random reasons. Why won't that? I assume that's part of the reason, I assume that's part of the
*  reason people are being, businesses are overly aggressive about shutting down. You know, Disneyland,
*  you know, my understanding was Disneyland got a special exemption, they could stay open and they
*  shut down anyway, because, you know, that's just, that's a litigation nightmare, I assume.
*  So I think the reopening decisions, especially in more bureaucratic corporations,
*  it will be very hard for everyone to sign off and agree, yes, we're going to go ahead, there's going
*  to be, you know, an open Disneyland again, we're going to have spectators at NBA games, the risk
*  of bad publicity, social media storms against companies where, whether true or not, someone
*  might have died as the result of going to a game. You know, over some time horizon, social norms
*  may shift. And a lot of people might just say, look, we're just going to take these chances and
*  deal with it. But I don't think we're close to that. And certainly our legal system is not close to
*  that. And human resources departments are not close to that. I guess I disagree a little bit. I mean,
*  I saw an earlier interview you did on this, where you suggested some larger cultural changes than I
*  think are likely. And I base that partly on the idea that, you know, right now, people under the
*  age of 25 are having trouble self isolating. Part of it's because they think they're not at risk.
*  Part of it is they don't, maybe they don't worry so much. They don't have as much of a forward
*  looking thought process. Part of it is, hey, I want to have a good time. And I think the human
*  impulse of that is going to be strong. But the legal part is huge. I agree with you there.
*  I want to go back to your comment though about organizational capital, because I don't fully
*  understand that. Let me use the word destruction. I think it's important to make a distinction
*  between what we would call wartime destruction and economic destruction, the
*  shimpeterian destruction. You know, the way I think about it is this real estate developer said to me,
*  very successful, he said, he said this to me 10 days ago, is when I started thinking,
*  this is troubling. He said, I'm going to lose all my buildings. I said, why are you going to lose
*  all your buildings? He said, well, people live in them, aren't going to be able to get work.
*  They're not going to be able to work. They're not going to have a paycheck. Some of them,
*  not all of them, some of them are going to keep receiving a paycheck anyway, but some of them
*  aren't going to be able to get a paycheck. I'm not going to be able to pay my loans off. The bank's
*  going to foreclose on me and I'm going to lose my buildings. Now that's a personal tragedy for
*  everybody involved. The buildings are not going to be destroyed though, right? Someone else is going
*  to buy them up some point in the future, maybe the same person eventually. But the buildings
*  aren't destroyed. Who owns them is destroyed. The stream of revenue that they provided for that
*  person might be reduced or end. That restaurant that goes out of business, there's going to be a
*  restaurant there again. It just might not be the same person. They might not have the opportunity
*  to do that. So when you talk about the organizational capital being destroyed,
*  what do you have in mind? Well, think of the labor market as being a very complex
*  matching problem, right? So after the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, unemployment was much
*  higher. It took really a very, very long time for labor markets to come back. That was work over a
*  decade and that was not 20% unemployment and it was not with any kind of public health crisis
*  going on. So if you think of, you know, some workers will want to be laid off to collect
*  unemployment insurance or collect it more quickly. Revenues for many businesses will go down.
*  The ties between employers and workers will end up weakened. People will go off and do other things.
*  So reconstituting an enterprise, you know, think of it as like putting together a great sports team,
*  like those old San Antonio Spurs teams. That took them quite a few years of drafting and training
*  and playing together as a squad, having the right coach in place. And our economy had been doing a
*  fairly good job of that, but there's a big reset button being pressed on all those activities. And
*  that's what I mean by the organizational capital going down. In some ways that will spur efficiency.
*  So firms having to get rid of their less productive workers, right? But in the short run,
*  I think it will be fairly dire and our bounce back could be slower than many people are expecting.
*  Okay. I guess I'm not sure, you know, so much of the economy is going to continue
*  humming along in the background, like we're doing right now. Here we are producing this podcast.
*  Whether universities can successfully teach classes online, of course, is a struggle.
*  But I think a lot of things are going to stay in place. And I'm not sure how important is
*  the organizational capital of a restaurant. They're going to put a sign out for waiters and
*  people are going to go work there who used to work there before. I think restaurants-
*  I really think there's such a big reality. You know, the matching problem,
*  let me say it differently. The 2008 crisis was that part of it, a lot of pieces to it, obviously,
*  but the labor market part was that we had two sectors of the economy, construction,
*  and particularly, and then manufacturing that took a massive hit. And those workers had to figure
*  out what they should do next. And a lot of them sat on the sidelines. They couldn't find anything
*  that was attractive to them. It was a huge matching problem. You're sitting in Las Vegas,
*  and you're not sure whether you're going to have a job in a week, a month, six months, or a year,
*  and you kind of hope it'll be a week. So you wait, and you don't relocate, you don't move,
*  you don't retrain. You don't imagine realistically that this entire industry that you spent your life
*  in is never going to come back for a long time, at least to the level it was before. And so you
*  don't adjust. And that's a huge problem. This seems a little different, or do you not think so?
*  Well, now it's face-to-face services taking a big hit, which in America is significant. I think an
*  advantage the American economy has, we have more big business than just about any other economy or
*  close to it. And big businesses will be much more stable than smaller ones, say, as you might find
*  in Italy. But you mentioned universities. Let's say, come fall semester, universities are still
*  online. What percentage of the students will still sign up and pay tuition, or at what rate?
*  I don't think anyone knows. Universities don't have a lot of control over their labor costs.
*  When you apply these possible revenue hits to fairly bureaucratized segments of our society,
*  again, I think you're going to see serious problems much bigger than during the financial crisis. And
*  again, that was only about 10% to 11% unemployment. Probably now we're talking something much higher.
*  And the uncertainty of future waves of the virus, which may or may not happen, but I think it's
*  unlikely that by July or August, we will know for sure they won't happen. That will be a significant
*  damper on economic activity in a way that, you know, there was some point in 2009, maybe things
*  were quite dire, but no one felt anymore that another Lehman Brothers event was around the corner.
*  You know, Eurozone aside, that was its own story. But there was a point where we could all breathe
*  a sigh of relief and then just wonder how well the recovery would take. And this may not be that.
*  There's not a clear end date in a way you usually see with financial crises. I don't mean to be the
*  downer guy here, but there are goals to talk these through, honestly. There are people I know more
*  pessimistic than I am. So those are some of the factors that worry me. And as you know, our own
*  economy, labor markets are so overregulated that will hinder our adjustment.
*  Yeah, I think that's true. It's fascinating how many calls there have been in the last couple
*  of days for relaxing various kinds of regulations. The most obvious being FDA approval for testing
*  for the virus, relaxing HIPAA regulations, privacy regulations on telemedicine
*  so that older people can get medical care without having to go out into public. So some of these
*  things, of course, are going to have longer term consequences. We may decide some of these
*  regulations weren't so productive to start with. I don't know. But you are painting a much more
*  dire picture than I expected. I would say that if you are right, Donald Trump will not be reelected.
*  You're suggesting he's going to be in the middle of a major recession.
*  Accusations that he bungled the opening of this and unemployment in the 20% range. He's cooked.
*  I'm not sure that's true about Trump. If you think of this as an allegus to a wartime event,
*  clearly FDR did not manage Pearl Harbor very well, but he certainly was reelected. So some
*  electorates, possibly still ours, have a tendency to stick with the incumbent in situations that
*  feel like wartime. I don't know if that's still true, but I wouldn't leap to the conclusion that
*  it's not. So that's very tricky. And again, I think we need to think through other parts of
*  the global economy. So economic growth in China right now almost certainly is negative. They are
*  bouncing back, but the Chinese economy has been sustained by momentum. Their off-balance sheet,
*  municipal debts are very, very high. That's a major problem for them. I know our economy is not so
*  closely tied to the Chinese economy, but European economies are. Many European governments seem to
*  be managing this worse than the United States, certainly worse than East Asia. So this is
*  likely more of a correlated global event than in fact 2008-2009 was, though that had a fairly
*  high degree of correlation. And that too is a concern. And there's much less what you might
*  call organizational or cooperative capital internationally now than there was in 2008-2009.
*  Far more nationalism, countries not being nice to each other. The European Union has been, in my
*  opinion, highly ineffective in doing much. Everything has happened at the national level,
*  for better or worse. So leadership in the United States, again, I view that as not having been high
*  quality as of late. I think there are many things to be concerned about. But I think that the view,
*  it's like all Trump's fault, that's very dangerous. And it's important to combat that.
*  Trump was very late to the party showing up to do anything. But if you look at Western European
*  governments, if you look at a lot of governors, a lot of private businesses, China, there's been a
*  systemic failure on this. And Trump is certainly part of it. But sort of just getting rid of Trump
*  or criticizing Trump, I think that's very much the wrong way to go here. We need to have accountability
*  more generally. I'm just going to make this observation. You can comment if you want. But
*  I find it, I love Twitter. I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with it, as my listeners
*  know, because it can be an ugly sinkhole of attention, of acrimony and other things. But
*  I think for me, and I think for you as well, based on our pre-recording conversation,
*  it's a huge source of information. It's where I go to find out what's going on right now.
*  And that's the positive side. The negative side is the number of people who are using the crisis
*  to advance their ideological or political agenda. There are things to learn from this about the
*  proper role of government, the relative level of responsibility of say, a Republican or Democrat,
*  but the zeal and ease with which people paint this situation as the result of problem X or
*  Y that conforms with their pre-existing worldview. And I include myself in this
*  guilty party. That's very depressing to me. Does that get to you at all?
*  Yes. I try to follow better people on Twitter, but even following better people,
*  one sees quite a bit of this. But that said, I think we will have to make significant adjustments
*  in a post-coronavirus world. I think the upside is to believe that at least biomedicine will be far
*  swifter and better funded and less regulated in the good sense of that word. And our response
*  capabilities when all this is over for the next event will be far, far greater. We may overreact
*  in some 9-11 kind of ways, like we've done arguably with airport procedures. But if there's one part
*  of the economy that will get a huge beneficial boost, I think it is our biomedical capabilities
*  and our public health infrastructure. And you might think we're going to make big policy mistakes in
*  many other areas. I do expect that. But in that one area, I think we will end up in a much better
*  place. And if you see that as a major sector going forward in any case, completely aside from the
*  issue of pandemics, that's one of the major positives likely to come from this, that the
*  next time something like this happens, you won't have the FDA banning states from doing or approving
*  their own tests. It'll just happen. That's true. Let's talk for a second about a possible upside
*  of the story, a possible cheerier story. Is it irresponsible to have this conversation,
*  Tyler? Are we risking that people will misunderstand this? I think not. I'm going to take a chance here
*  and talk about what I think is a cheerier story. Is it possible that we've overestimated the death
*  rate based on Italy and Seattle, Washington, because there are older populations that got
*  infected? Is it possible that one of the things being tested right now for treatment will turn
*  out to be fairly effective, that a vaccine will be here in not 18 months, but more like something
*  shorter, but that the treatment will carry us over until that happens, and that some of these more
*  depressing or cataclysmic economic changes will be much smaller than you're worrying about?
*  I think those are very good questions. I think any conversation about these matters has an
*  irresponsible element, no matter how carefully you do it. And I take that very seriously.
*  I think ultimately you have to compare what you are saying or writing to what you think the
*  discourse will be like without you, but I don't think it's possible to have a completely responsible
*  conversation. A number of the specific points you raised, a vaccine, so given that most people are
*  not at all harmed by coronavirus, the safety of the vaccine has to really be very high, right?
*  So that will take a while. To the best of my knowledge, we've never developed an effective
*  vaccine for any other coronavirus. Now I do think from what I read and hear, it is possible to do
*  it now, but it is not a trivial procedure. It is doing a something for the first time. It's doing
*  it in an environment that is highly regulated and bureaucratized, where institutions are slow to
*  respond. Simple issues like scaling up a ventilator, production and distribution, we are still far
*  behind the curve, even though we are really quite sure that is an urgent matter. Even if you're
*  relatively optimistic about this crisis, we are to this day performing poorly on that matter.
*  So will we get the vaccine right? There's a lot of optimism out there, but I don't think it's a
*  likely scenario that simply four or five months from now everyone is getting the vaccine and in
*  essence the problem is vanishing. That seems quite unlikely from what I read and hear. It's maybe more
*  like 12 to 18 months. If we're extremely lucky, it could be a bit less than that. And then in terms of
*  treatments that work, I think there's a lot of uncertainty. Many treatments are being tried
*  right now. There's a lot of experimentation. Hard for me as a non-biomedicine person to judge.
*  We'll just have to see. But again, there's still liability issues. There's scaling issues.
*  There's distribution issues, possibility of secondary harms, given that most people are not
*  killed or even harmed by coronavirus. Very complicated. Fair enough. We'll see. I guess
*  I spent most of my life as an optimist. Most of that optimism ended around, I think,
*  it slowly started to decline through the 2000s as events maybe more, and I got older. I think when
*  you get older, you get crankier. I think the 2000s were not nearly as bad as people think,
*  by the way. It's a separate matter. But they did not dent my optimism maybe as much as yours.
*  I find it in the face of your gloominess, I found my natural optimism re-arising. I don't know
*  whether that's good or bad. I guess we'll see what actually happens. It's kind of foolish to
*  talk about it or to forecast it. I do think there's an interesting dynamic going on now between
*  it reminds me a little bit of other social issues, climate change,
*  you name it, where people argue that we should be more worried than we might otherwise be because
*  that otherwise will encourage people to be less worried. I find that hard to be sensitive to.
*  I think it's important. There was a big dust-up yesterday on Twitter because Johnny and Edie
*  suggested we're in the dark here. We might be overreacting. We don't have much data.
*  In the dark here, we might be overreacting. We don't have much data.
*  As Taleb and others responded back, that's why you have to be extra careful.
*  Yes, I agree with Taleb on that. I would say I've become much more pessimistic about our ability to
*  respond to climate change because what we're seeing with coronavirus is how unwilling so
*  many people are to act until the very last moment, if even that.
*  To make a sacrifice. Sacrifices are hard. It's not easy. A big pre-rider problem there,
*  essentially. It's in both those situations, climate change and this. The idea that I'm
*  going to make a sacrifice of lifestyle for some promise of reduced external harm is hard for
*  people to motivate people that way. I think the thing I'm recommending for a lot of people now
*  is to find a sphere of activity, no matter how small or how local, that you feel you can control
*  and you can do at home and you can contribute to. This feeling of powerlessness may set in
*  that will cause people to panic more or become too depressed or just make them much less productive
*  or spread to their families or maybe cause them to go out and want to get drunk and, you know,
*  become a spreader in some manner. Really to think long and hard. I'm not really counseling stoicism.
*  I'm counseling a kind of action. Something you can do and even if it ends up only being a placebo,
*  you will feel more in control and of course there's a chance it will pay off and have some
*  benefits. I think that's an important idea to promote at this point. I like the idea that
*  while you're home, if you're not usually at home, to try to have a project that you're alluding to
*  that effectively, which is teach yourself a language, an instrument, learn how to draw.
*  There's just so many wonderful things you can do online now without having to go out of your house.
*  You can make yourself get better at something. That's your niche idea, right? Work at something.
*  I'm doing a plank every day, getting down on the ground trying to improve my core. I'm taking a
*  walk every day, which I didn't otherwise do. I think it's great to try to create those
*  habits for yourself in this window of enforced, unusual behavior.
*  In terms of policy, what do you expect on the fiscal and monetary fronts moving forward?
*  Great minds think alike, Tyler. Let's talk about that.
*  Well, I think there's some confusion between the abatement of suffering and what we would
*  normally call fiscal stimulus. A lot of what people are proposing is fiscal stimulus isn't
*  going to stimulate anything. People aren't making things because they can't go to work or go out
*  of their house. Putting money in people's hands has no impact on the overall economy. It will help
*  them pay their rent, which will reduce that cascading worry that I mentioned earlier from
*  the real estate developer I had talked to. That's going to be, I think, extremely important in
*  reducing the set of economic readjustments that you were more focused on than I was in an earlier
*  part of the conversation. But the idea that somehow we're going to solve the economic disruption
*  through traditional means seems to be either monetary or fiscal seems to me to be
*  very unlikely. You can make a case for giving people cash right now. I like when people say
*  quickly, as if we know how to do that. The last time I think we did this, it took two months.
*  It didn't do much for the economy. The Bush administration did that, whatever it was called,
*  tax rebate or whatever it was, a long time ago now. Rebecca and I think 2001.
*  I'm not sure we have a lot of weapons for this kind of idea. Come back to my earlier metaphor.
*  Everybody go home for a month, maybe six weeks, maybe two months. When you come back,
*  your business might not exist anymore, so find something else. The idea that we're going to fix
*  that with monetary and fiscal policy seems to be unlikely. The idea that we're going to
*  bail everyone out, make everyone whole is going to be really hard to implement. We can say it.
*  You can talk about it like it's a policy, but I'm not sure how you'd implement it. What are
*  your thoughts on it? I worry that we don't know how many businesses are bouncing back
*  and how many cannot be kept on life support. Again, if it's a month or two, I think almost
*  all of them can be kept on life support. We could throw money at the problem, and then in two months
*  just pick up the pieces and be the America we once knew. If it's becoming five or six months
*  or longer, then the amount of money you have to send and people just being kept in unproductive
*  activities, you actually want some of those restaurant owners maybe to end up as UPS drivers.
*  We don't know how many. The degree of optimism or pessimism, it really seems to matter
*  for economic stimulus. If you're a relative optimist about the progression of the virus,
*  I think you should be relatively pro-stimulus. Like, oh, just keep it running for now. Things
*  will be back. To the extent you have a more dire forecast, you even worry a bit about the government's
*  own budget constraint, and you also start asking how many of these people, it's like a new world,
*  need to be doing something else. Maybe you don't want to hasten that at the fastest possible speed,
*  but you're not aiming to just keep every business going, say, with loans from the Fed either. I see
*  people making different arguments, and I get very uncomfortable. I think we should be more agnostic
*  than what I'm seeing. Agnostic doesn't mean you do nothing, but that to me is one of the biggest
*  uncertainties in this debate that's hardly ever being acknowledged. You have a document you put
*  out, and we'll link to it with a whole long list of policy ideas that might make things better.
*  I want to focus on one for a minute that comes to mind as we talk about some of the worst-case
*  scenarios, and that's the idea of prizes. I know you're a big fan of prizes. I'm a big fan of prizes
*  too. Let's put it in this context. I know that the pharmaceutical company Gilead has a drug that
*  Remdesivir that's under possible consideration. They're testing it now to see how it's going to
*  do. I think they've created a pre-ebola, and it seems to have some mitigating effect. We're going
*  to find out. Let's say it doesn't. Let's say it does. Is Gilead then going to be able to charge
*  whatever they want for that? Very unlikely. Right? Especially globally, right?
*  Right. But at this moment, right now, I've talked endlessly now on EconTalk. I have an episode coming
*  up soon on this question of this challenge we have of this semi-free market, this weird market
*  we have in pharmaceuticals that I think is poorly constructed. The incentives are wrong. We're
*  encouraging innovation that adds a couple of months of life at enormous costs of both
*  research and then Medicare payments. It seems like it's just a mistake. It's a bad system.
*  At the same time, I don't want to take the profitability out of the pharmaceutical business,
*  and I want Gilead and other companies, and Roche and others who've built this new test
*  that's relatively quick, I want them to have a big incentive to really solve this problem.
*  The normal way we do that is say, well, you're going to be able to charge a lot for it. I think
*  that's not going to happen either culturally or legally for legal or cultural reasons.
*  And with the externality of infectiousness, you don't want the price to be high, right?
*  Correct. Right. Well, you could solve that by letting them charge high price and the
*  government funding it, but I think the move- Yeah. At the consumer side, the price should be low,
*  and it's not going to happen. So buy the back rights at auction, give them a huge prize,
*  tens of billions of dollars if they deserve it. I'm all for this. Even if you think it has no
*  impact this time, this is not our last pandemic. It will matter for the next time around.
*  So I think those prices should be large, incredibly promised, and I would like to see us get on this.
*  That would seem to me to be, given our earlier conversation about the risk of a
*  permanent disruption of social life because of the recurring challenges that this might lead to,
*  you know, might be, we might be facing. That might be the one thing you'd want to
*  really kind of focus on is to get a lot of really smart people trying a lot of different ways to
*  mitigate the medical impact of this. Do you agree? Yes. I do think you have to be a little
*  careful in how you structure the prize. So a poorly specified prize will encourage people
*  to work in small groups and not share information, right? Oh, I want all the money for myself.
*  So some amount of discretion is required, and you want to favor, when you hand out the prize,
*  institutions that have been cooperating and sharing information, if you simply set up a
*  very credible board of a half dozen people with real expertise, you know, to decide how to hand
*  out, say, $50 billion, and you make sure there are people willing to write a check, like to a big
*  unpopular corporation, if that's who's done the good work, you know, I think that's what we should
*  do. But simply saying, well, there's going to be a prize for the company that solves this, you might
*  get a hoarding of information when the sharing is appropriate. You know, thinking about Jonas Salk,
*  the man who cured polio, and I think created the polio vaccine. I have read, I don't know if it's
*  true, that he gave it away when he discovered it. People pointed out that, yeah, that was a time
*  when there was an FDA testing that costs people debate what it costs to get a drug approved,
*  whether it's a mere 500 million or is it more like 2 billion. But obviously, we live in a world
*  where it's very expensive to get a drug approved. Do you think, is there other things you would do
*  to make a prize more effective? You know, a discretionary prize, like, I guess I was trying
*  to say two things. One is that these other pieces of the regulatory puzzle are part of, might be part
*  of the challenge. The other is that in the old days, the non-monetary aspects are also pretty
*  important. I mean, Jonas Salk is immortal. Maybe we should just say, whoever comes up with it,
*  we're going to have a set of baseball playing cards that we give away to every American child
*  to worship this person who saved their grandparents' lives. I don't know.
*  I've written in the past, we don't respect scientists enough, and that may be hurting us now.
*  One possible silver lining of this cloud is we will respect scientists a lot more if they come
*  through with some pretty big insignificant developments. I think that's likely at some point.
*  But just to pre-commit as a culture to honoring those people is something we all can do.
*  I'm going to interrupt just a second. Can you, Tyler, check your headset cable? It seems to be
*  rustling the connection to your computer. And if that doesn't fix it, we'll switch out mics and
*  Russ can take a listener question. But let's see how it sounds from here.
*  I pushed it back in again. Does it sound any different?
*  Better.
*  Okay.
*  Do you agree, Jeff?
*  Yeah, sounds great. Go ahead.
*  So where were we, Russ?
*  I don't know.
*  Respect your scientists and prizes. And what else should we do?
*  Well, I was going to ask you, if you were, quote, in charge, if you were either the
*  coronavirus czar today or president of the United States, besides creating potentially a very large
*  prize, the other ideas that are being bandied about, you know, or bailouts of various kinds
*  for certain industries that are particularly hard hit by this, you think there's a moral hazard
*  issue there? In some of those cases, obviously, in a lot of those cases, there's not much of a
*  moral hazard issue. Somebody pointed out, I don't think you expect the Thai restaurant on the corner
*  to prepare for a pandemic and act accordingly in advance so that, you know, worrying about the
*  impact of a bailout there is probably not the biggest worry. What are your thoughts on these
*  moral hazard issues? Do you think the airline should get a bailout? I think that's a good thing.
*  One has to be very careful with that word bailout. People mean so many different things by it.
*  I don't think our government should let all of the major corporations fail, which are likely to fail
*  if we do nothing. That said, at this point, I remain agnostic as to exactly what we should do.
*  On one hand, you don't want to be in a position of picking winners and losers. But on the other
*  hand, I think one needs to realize maybe, you know, cruise ships are not really coming back
*  in a big way and maybe they shouldn't. So there is something to be said for some sectoral targeting
*  here. But I think the political economy consequences of just letting all of those jobs go away are too
*  dire. And we would end up with much more government. We'd have like a new New Deal squared.
*  And I think some band-aid has to be applied. I've yet to see a plan that I find very convincing.
*  And they're all plans based on the premise of these businesses just need some loans to tide them over.
*  That might be true. It might be the bet we end up having to take because maybe there's not any other
*  bet. But I don't feel as good about it as the other people out there pushing these ideas. They
*  seem a little hasty to me, like they're taking tools out of the toolbox from the last crisis,
*  things they thought should have been done and weren't, and saying now is the time to see I was
*  right all along. Makes me very nervous. I'm seeing high levels of epistemic non-rationality.
*  But that said, I really am not here trying to argue for doing nothing. I don't think we can
*  let all the cards fall to the ground. What's your view on that? Well, I'm not sure what I'm like you.
*  I want to minimize what we do that's typically if it's likely to be permanent makes me really uneasy.
*  We're at risk that this becomes a watershed moment. I think it's actually it's probably too
*  late. Everyone just expects the government to quote solve this. Again, they neglect the things
*  that we've done on our own. I understand the things that we can't do on our own to fix
*  macroeconomic cascades. I'm not suggesting that we're going to avoid all the problems if we just
*  leave things alone. I know that that's not true. But there are a lot of things happening. People
*  are buying gift certificates from their favorite restaurants and other things to keep them going.
*  They're doing takeout. Obviously, that's not going to be enough. If people aren't flying,
*  there's going to be airlines going bankrupt. But the idea that somehow we can make everyone whole.
*  I really don't like the idea of being business as whole. I'd much rather make individuals whole.
*  I think that's just really hard to do. This idea of giving everybody $1,000. I don't need
*  $1,000. Presumably, you don't need $1,000. Do we want to allow every American to make it easy?
*  Should we do that? But it's clear there's going to be terrible hardship on individuals who can't get
*  to work or shouldn't go to work. There's no free market solution to that that's obvious.
*  There may be some of those things that are necessary to reduce the spread of the virus,
*  but they're so blunt. It discourages me tremendously to think about the consequences
*  of how that will be going forward, both in how it affects behavior that everyone thinks,
*  oh, I don't have to worry about filling the blank because eventually I'll get a check from the
*  government. Plus the idea that's... Go ahead. Here's one of the tricks when it comes to
*  bailouts. It's a common line to say, well, we want to keep services up and running,
*  but we don't want to bail out shareholders. You and I probably share that intuition in a very
*  significant majority of cases. But look, think about the airlines. Why do you feel safe flying?
*  To a modest degree, it's because of government regulations, but mainly it's because there's
*  equity capital in those companies and the shareholders want to keep the flight safe
*  because they don't want to lose their capital. If you have major or for that matter minor airlines
*  all operating at margins where that equity capital essentially has been wiped out,
*  I think that's a world where flying is no longer very safe. So the old recipe of,
*  we'll just have the equity holders eat as much of these losses as they possibly can. I don't know
*  if that works for the airlines. You mentioned a check to each individual for a thousand dollars.
*  That is one thing I would do if only to help people pay their rent or stock up on groceries.
*  I think some of that is just symbolic. There will be other things we will need to do. Maybe
*  we're not sure what, but if you haven't sent some aid to every American, you will be damned for
*  doing those other things for all eternity and that will be harder next time around.
*  I do think the thousand dollars will genuinely help people, but I think it has to be viewed
*  as part of a broader package and that is what makes the entire broader package
*  palatable to most voters. So I would do that. Well, as I suggested earlier, I think it's
*  palliative more than stimulative. I mean, I think it's, you know, it's
*  defensive. I would say it's not really going to stimulate, but you want to have forbearance
*  on rents, some amount of forbearance on debt, forbearance on enforcing bank capital standards.
*  These are all risky things, but ultimately you need to recapitalize the economy and the traditional
*  recipe of let all the equity be destroyed can slow down the rate at which you recapitalize.
*  Given that once the virus is more or less taken care of, the equity values of many things will
*  bounce back. So just how much we want equity to take a hit. What we have in mind is a
*  recapitalization process. To me, that's like the big question about the bailouts.
*  Not really very well answered as of yet. I don't see that capitalization issue as
*  an equity issue the way you do. I don't think American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta, etc.
*  want to take risks with their customers going forward because most of their equity isn't
*  crashing that plane. It's their brand name. Well, then the share value would be high,
*  but if we really let the equity value be wiped out by this recession or depression,
*  it would be very easy for the share values of United, Delta, and American to go to, you know,
*  a dollar a share. And even that would be kind of an option on the bailout, right?
*  And there's a lot of corporate debt in America right now. Corporate debt levels were pretty high.
*  It worked fine under the previous level of economic activity where people actually went
*  outdoors. I was not panicked over that. But corporate debt levels that high in a world with
*  20% unemployment and we're all intentionally trying to shrink output and maybe have a quarter
*  where output shrinks by say negative 13%. That makes me very nervous. And I start thinking
*  the capitalization of those enterprises is really important. For sure, I don't know. But I'm pretty
*  sure the debates I'm hearing are not sophisticated enough on this issue. Well, that's for sure. And I
*  think, you know, the biggest problem that pundits and I'll put myself in my class on this level of
*  conversation. I mean, we just use words like bailout as if we know what we're talking about
*  or it's well specified. And you're pointing out it's not well specified. I mean, what that means
*  in practice, what strings are going to be attached to it. And I think there will be strings attached
*  this time that weren't attached in 2008, which probably might be a good thing. I think some of
*  those things were not good in 2008. And I think have discouraged people's faith in democracy and
*  capitalism, which has been part of our problem going forward. But you know, a lot of this,
*  it's hard to imagine. Let's turn to, we've got about 20 minutes left. Let's turn to two issues
*  that we've started to talk about a little bit, which are the, whether this is going to
*  have a longer run impact on the way Americans expect government to solve problems versus
*  individuals. Obviously, that trend has been going on for about 70 years, or maybe, maybe 100 years,
*  you could argue that government should be doing more. This seems to be this is going to accelerate
*  that trend, potentially. Yes. And then culturally, so for people like you and I who wish it were
*  going at least in some sense in the other direction are going to be increasingly irrelevant.
*  The second question would be, you know, what kind of cultural changes do you think this will
*  lead to in the short run version versus the longer version? The shorter version,
*  we get some palliative effect of, say, medicine and treatment and vaccine. And this becomes a
*  moment that we talk about with laughter that, you know, for many of us, it's the time we had to stay
*  inside. It's when the lines were long at the grocery. It's when people were obsessed with
*  toilet paper. It's when people didn't shake hands. They did some other weird little gesture with
*  their elbow or whatever. But at the other extreme, you're suggesting a radical realignment of social
*  life. So let's talk about those two things in the last 20 minutes we have left. I think some
*  to see any of them. Yes, I'll give you my take, then you can give me yours. I think some schools
*  will do online education well for a subset of classes. And we'll end up in a world where
*  20% of what is now done face to face will be done online. And that will be cheaper and better. And
*  I fully get you cannot do a face to face discussion humanities class that way. But I think we'll see
*  much more online education, we will see permanently fewer meetings, zoom and Skype and how to use them
*  as we're doing now, we'll get much better. This will be a permanent change going forward. I think
*  in general pandemics make people more nationalistic, more what you call what you might call right wing
*  in the cranky sense, not in the classical liberal sense. I think the progressive left, in essence,
*  will die out as an intellectual force, and actually already has as of this week, and will never really
*  come back that what will have its adherence that when people feel what is that when you said the
*  progressive left, what do you mean? Who are those people? What viewpoint are you talking about? And
*  why is it dying out? People who support Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, which is a pretty
*  significant chunk of this country's intellectuals that arguing for that kind of redistribution or
*  splitting up big tech or whatever it's going to be, that is a kind of luxury made possible by people
*  living on the coasts in comfortable circumstances who are well educated. But when those people
*  themselves feel threatened, and America's middle class feels threatened, whether correctly they
*  feel that way, or it's a kind of paranoid overreaction, but I do think that is coming
*  and already here. Going around talking about redistributing the wealth, letting in so many
*  more immigrants, whatever you think of those points of view, I think they will have much,
*  much less social impact, and we will be more inward looking, more nationalistic,
*  less cosmopolitan, and I think you see this already, and I think that is a semi-permanent
*  shift that will last for at least a decade, probably longer, and that is already the case.
*  You really think Joe Biden is going to get up in the debate against Donald Trump and go on and on
*  about immigration? Of course he won't now. Yeah, but you don't think he's going to be a lot more
*  eager to... You've already come, you just said we should get a thousand dollars. We will have much
*  more government intervention. It will be with right-wing toppings and flavor. I'm not saying
*  this is a good thing. There will be much more intervention in the healthcare system, but it
*  will be a kind of triage, and treating healthcare is scarce, not giving it away to everyone for free,
*  and it will be brutal and we'll feel bad about it, and it will make the debates, again, more
*  right-wing. I don't mean more libertarian. I don't mean more liberty-oriented. I mean right-wing in
*  a very particular direction, but those are my takes. You give me yours. Yeah, well, I don't see
*  that, but I want you to keep going. Let's talk about the cultural changes.
*  I'm going to go a different direction. I think people have a great thirst for face-to-face,
*  and I don't think Zoom is... I love Zoom. I love Skype. Big fan of them. Love the internet. Love
*  talking to tens of thousands of people through my... Through Econ Talk once a week. At the same time,
*  as you know, when you do a live event, people don't say, oh, why would I go... Like right now,
*  I don't know how many people are watching this, but this is a crummy version of face-to-face.
*  Right? It's a screen version, but there are people who are watching this live because they rather do
*  that than listen later when it's not live, and if we were doing this in an auditorium, if it were
*  safe to do it in an auditorium, we'd get a bigger crowd. Not a bigger crowd, excuse me. We'd get an
*  enthusiastic crowd. The scaling problem would keep it small, but I think there's still a tremendous
*  thirst for that. I would much rather sit and have coffee with you than talk over Skype with you
*  about this problem. I think how much more productive this is, right? Much bigger viewership than our
*  coffee clutch. But you're the guy who taught me. That's true, but you're the guy that taught me
*  that I thought you were going to say it's more productive because I don't have to go to the
*  coffee shop, but I think we underestimate... I think I learned this review, that the value of
*  this kind of time spent. Oh, sure. Process. Yeah, just doing nothing is very valuable.
*  We underestimate what it allows us to do, but all I'm saying is that I think
*  people like to hug, and that's not going to change. They like to shake hands. If anything,
*  I think we become more physical. We become more European. I think there'll be a huge wave of
*  promiscuous sex once there's the first break in the virus, for instance. There goes my G rating
*  on Econ Talk. I'm sorry. That's okay. We may have to cut that out for the...
*  I think there's a pendulum here of people who will react to this. When I say this,
*  I mean the digitalization, the virtualization of daily life. People don't like it. We like a lot of
*  it. I love a lot of it. I know you do too. But for a lot of people, I think there's going to be a
*  pushback. I see it in the... Among young people already, and my kids and their friends,
*  they have problems dealing with the obsessiveness and addictiveness of online life,
*  but they're also eager to stay away from it if they can. I just think a lot of that's going to
*  happen with this as well. Here's what I'm trying to say. I don't think that X months of self-isolation
*  is going to change our habits. It's not going to change our nature. We're going to...
*  The revenue constraint will change us, right? Say you're running a university and your revenue's
*  down 15% and you have a chance to buy a class online or try to create your own class. Which
*  are you going to do? That's what I think will drive it is revenue constraints.
*  Well, I think that's... Six years ago, maybe whenever it was, when the early mooks were
*  coming out, online classes, I was all excited that there'd be a revolution. That hasn't happened.
*  Now, this is going to give it another chance. Maybe it'll spur it along. I think it's equally
*  likely they'll say, well, that was incredibly ineffective. We got to go back to face-to-face.
*  So I don't know. I'm very agnostic on this. I think the idea that we... You don't need a coronavirus
*  to discourage people from going to sporting events, right? The number of people who watch sporting
*  events live is a very, very small number. It's a unique experience. A concert is the same way. A
*  concert, live theater, those are all... They're extraordinary. There are substitutes for them
*  that aren't nearly as good, but they're a lot cheaper and easier to access. So we access them,
*  but I can't see those dying out at all. In fact, they may bounce back stronger than ever.
*  I think we'll see a kind of polarization. Things will be either very face-to-face and very exciting
*  and very extreme, or things will be very online. The kind of average degree of online-ness may not
*  change, but you'll demand more from your face-to-face encounters, and I won't use my previous point again,
*  and then you'll be doing more on Zoom and Skype and other services. So I think we'll compensate
*  for that by having our face-to-face be all the more huggy or whatever you think it might be.
*  Well, I like the idea that norms are evolving now that will encourage face-to-face to be higher
*  quality. I do think the idea that in the middle of a conversation, you can look at your phone or
*  glance at your Apple Watch to see who's texting you, I think that's increasingly going to be
*  seen as unattractive. The etiquette of that's going to evolve, but I don't know how it'll be,
*  but I think increasingly people will put away their phones because they don't want to be
*  connected 24-7. But we'll see. It's a bit of romance maybe on my part that when we are face-to-face,
*  we're going to do it with more focus, intention, presence. It's a nice idea. I like the idea.
*  I agree completely. It might be true. It's not really the way we're hardwired, right? To suggest
*  that we can interact with each other without distraction is a beautiful idea, but in a way,
*  all that the digital revolution has done is to make it more obvious how hard that is for us.
*  It's not simply that there's new things to distract us. It's that we were already very
*  distractible. Now we're more aware of how distractible we are. Maybe that'll help us.
*  We're almost out of time. Do you want to say anything about
*  more narrow fiscal monetary stuff that we didn't talk about that you think is either going to
*  happen that you're horrified at or that you think is not going to happen that we should do?
*  It's things that aren't on the table. I think the prize idea is huge, undervalued. I think we ought
*  to be promoting that with great enthusiasm. We don't need the government to do it. The
*  beauty of having some really rich people who've created these foundations is they can offer them
*  right now. Maybe they already have. I haven't been paying close attention,
*  but that's a really important thing.
*  I'm running my own prizes through Emergent Ventures.
*  Talk about that.
*  It is now at about $1.4 million with some other pledges on the way,
*  and other interest expressed, so I'm not sure.
*  Describe it. Describe what it is for people who don't know.
*  People who do meritorious things, who do things that are not in their own interest,
*  people who do meritorious things to contribute to the end of coronavirus problems,
*  whether it be coming up with a cure or online blogging or creating a website that tracks
*  information, something that is otherwise under rewarded. This is not a prize that will go to
*  Gilead. The sum of money is not big enough to change their incentives, but for individuals
*  who have done important things, they will receive this as an additional reward.
*  Like a live streaming YouTube with a really important thinker about where we're headed?
*  Exactly. Whatever is effective. These are not yet publicly announced, but as of now,
*  there are four prizes awarded already, and I'm very proud of them. I hope by Friday the
*  information will be out, and these are people who have done amazing things, and I'm pretty
*  sure they haven't been paid a dime for it. Can you give one example? Is this public?
*  Not public yet. So some of these you've heard of probably, but in any case, I think the prizes
*  will encourage more people and just generate attention for those who have done the right
*  thing, and I think encourage them to do more, because this is a marathon, not a sprint,
*  and the people who have already done wonderful things are maybe some of the people more likely
*  to continue doing wonderful things. Let's finish with what advice you'd give people
*  both personally and ethically for going forward. We talked a little bit at the beginning about
*  niche behavior or trying to get better at things. Talk about what information people might access
*  where you encourage people to go, what you encourage people to do to deal with this going forward.
*  Well, on my own blog, Marginal Revolution, I'm trying to collect the information that I consider
*  to be either reliable or at least interesting, worth reading, worth thinking about. So whatever
*  I know I'm putting up there, and the volume of blog posting is much higher. So by definition,
*  that's what I think is important. Clearly it's not all true, and I try to indicate when something is
*  true and I try to indicate when something is speculative. So I can't not recommend my own
*  efforts, but I think the important thing is for people to be as safe as they possibly can
*  and to develop that regimen in a way that is psychologically sustainable, not just to say it
*  and then a week later be off gallivanting in the St. Patrick's Day parade or whatever.
*  And that's very hard. The remedies differ by person. Don't trust everything you're reading here.
*  The degree of misinformation is very high. The degree of uncertainty from the best and
*  most reputable sources is very high. So there's no magic bullet on how to figure out what's going on.
*  I can't quite say, oh, trust the authorities. That's not exactly how it's gone,
*  but there's not any, you know, single way to really know what's happening. That's very frustrating.
*  I would say do your best and keep in mind that's a highly imperfect endeavor. There's a lot you
*  won't know and some of the things you think you know are probably wrong. For you?
*  Well, I've been thinking a lot about, you know, the so-called death of expertise.
*  I was really going to ask you about that, whether, you know, a lot of people have been crowing
*  this week about how, ha, you know, see, you do need these experts. And, you know, I don't,
*  obviously epidemiology and understanding the science of this is incredibly valuable and
*  important. I'm a big fan of science. I'm not such a big fan of experts. That would include you and
*  me, Tyler. I'm not, I do think that, I do think the internet has helped influential people influence
*  people's behavior to be more worried about this, which I think is probably going to be a lifesaver
*  for, I think, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people. I think that's been a very, very good
*  thing. I don't know what's going to happen if the death toll is enormously high or enormously low.
*  I think that's going to have a lot of ramifications. I think people are paying attention to this in a
*  way that they don't pay attention to other things, obviously, and they're going to have judgments
*  based on the outcomes that are, you know, probably not going to be not so healthy. So I don't know.
*  I'm very interested in what that's like going forward. You know, I'm thinking a lot, we've
*  talked about this before when we talked this last summer, I'm thinking a lot about how we're
*  influenced by data and numbers. And we're so focused right now on cases for deaths or, you know,
*  there's so many other aspects of life. We have to focus on cases of death. That's exactly we
*  shouldn't, but I find it fascinating how that's almost all we're focusing on. What this is going
*  to do to the fabric of American life going forward, you know, we've spent the last hour and a half
*  trying to get some idea of what that might be. That's going to be kind of important, too. We're
*  not so focused on that because you can't measure it. I think the internet and the scientific
*  community will both come out of this looking very, very different from the other countries.
*  I'm fine with saying go to the experts, but who are the experts? It's a bit tautologous.
*  You know, should you just turn on the evening news and listen to your president and prime minister
*  and say, oh, they're channeling the experts on that? I don't know. The record's not been so
*  great so far. The true experts, of course, by definition, those are the people you should
*  listen to. But this is an unprecedented event. And who the true experts turn out to be,
*  is still a bit up for grabs, I would say. My guest today, to the extent he's been a guest,
*  has been Tyler Cowen. Tyler, always great to talk to you. My guest today, to the extent he's been a
*  guest, is Russ Roberts. Russ, always great to talk to you. Again, my condolences with your family.
*  Thank you. And we should stay in close touch and wishing you the very, very best. And you take care
*  as well. Thank you, Tyler. Thank you, Russ.
