Video Description: Tobi Lütke, co-founder of Shopify, critiques the German education system he grew up with. He believes memorizing answers without context is a flawed approach, and his passion for computers clashed with traditional schooling. Is learning Latin really more important than English?

# Why German schools failed Tobi Lütke  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjVbRUXdoXE)
*  I think because German school at that time was in love with serializing out answers and trying to fill you up with as many answers as possible and hope that you would be able to apply them to problems you encounter later.
*  I don't know if there's a good theory for that being a sensible approach that would stand up to reason.
*  It certainly didn't work for me.
*  I kind of am literally upset.
*  I need to have every problem before I can learn the answer to it.
*  What we're being taught in the 90s and so on during these times was in stark contrast with what was interesting for working with computers.
*  That was really just the most fun thing for me to do during this time and seemed very valuable even then.
*  This probably sounds too abstract.
*  Latin as first extra language is just not highly utilitarian.
*  Knowing Latin is very rarely the correct answer to questions you might encounter later in life.
*  So it's not saying it's not valuable in some way, but maybe start with English.
*  That would be a good start.
