# Joe Boyd on when Dylan went electric ðŸŽ¸ | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE)
*  And a lot of people in the audience sensed that this was a bull in a china shop. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=0.0s)]
*  That this was big time something moving into this delicate little world. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=5.8s)]
*  And I was totally on Dylan's side. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=12.72s)]
*  Nobody had ever heard sound that loud. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=15.64s)]
*  I think Rothschild pushed up the faders, but it had to be because it was the equation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=17.64s)]
*  It was the first moment of rock. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=25.64s)]
*  Nobody ever used the word rock before 1965. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=28.4s)]
*  There was rock and roll, there was pop, there was rhythm and blues, but there wasn't rock. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=32.72s)]
*  And this was rock. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=38.16s)]
*  And that escalation of volume is kind of what shaped or defined the future of rock. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=39.72s)]
*  It became really loud music. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=47.72s)]
*  And that was the first time anybody heard it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=51.0s)]
*  It was really shocking. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dgAt9xy_YE&t=52.76s)]
