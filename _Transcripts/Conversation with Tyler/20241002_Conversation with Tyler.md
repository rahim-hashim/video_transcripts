# Are TikTok scrollers learning sound economics from their feeds?  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKjWNJbj2pw)
*  Putting aside your own work, what kind of economics do you think young people are learning from TikTok?
*  Concerning.
*  Is it conspiratorial? Is it leaning in some particular direction?
*  I would say it's definitely conspiratorial. There's a lot of desire to pin inflation onto companies,
*  which I don't know if that's the best thing to do.
*  There's a lot of desire to have a scapegoat, right?
*  I think a lot of people are frustrated with their economic situation,
*  and so they look at TikTok videos and somebody's telling them that, yes, BlackRock is conspiring against them,
*  and that's very soothing, right?
*  And so I think that's where we've ended up with TikTok and Econ.
