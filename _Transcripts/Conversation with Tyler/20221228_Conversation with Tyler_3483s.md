# Conversations with Tyler 2022 Retrospective  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8qjGuC_e_Q)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome to this, the 2022 Year in Review episode of Conversations
*  with Tyler.
*  I'm Jeff Holmes, one of the producers of Conversations with Tyler.
*  And this has become a tradition now where at the end of the year, we take stock of the
*  year in conversations.
*  I have a bit of a conversation with Tyler that I want to have.
*  We take questions from listeners.
*  And we also go back and look at Tyler's pop culture picks of 2012 in this case.
*  And Tyler lets us know how he thinks they fared.
*  But first, Tyler, let's get straight into the year of conversations.
*  When you look at this guest list, reflect on this roster of guests compared to years
*  past.
*  What do you think?
*  I think we should have more Irish people on.
*  Roy Foster was great.
*  He was a definite favorite.
*  We had two moments that went completely viral, one of which was misunderstood.
*  Shruti was awesome as a host.
*  Walter Russell Mead throws great dinner parties.
*  Mary Gates Gill was a wonderful kind of quirky.
*  And very often, the best guests are not the ones who you think will be the best.
*  That would be my year's take in summary.
*  When you say a moment that went viral but was misunderstood, what are you referring
*  to?
*  I asked Mark Andreessen about Web 3.0.
*  And everyone on Twitter went crazy about this.
*  Mark had a perfectly normal answer to a normal question.
*  Now, I'm still not convinced by Web 3.0.
*  And Mark's answer didn't convince me.
*  But people treated it as some kind of massive, scandalous admission of something.
*  And it was just a normal conversation.
*  After it was recorded, I don't think either Mark or I thought anything about that moment.
*  But somehow, that was the time when people wanted to jump down Mark's throat over something.
*  And they picked up on that clip.
*  And I think the best answer to what's the use case for Web 3.0 is just, we don't know
*  yet.
*  There are lots of talented people working on it at the moment, as you might have said
*  with the early internet.
*  Now, I'm still skeptical.
*  But it's not a terrible answer.
*  And that was the misunderstood viral moment, I would say.
*  Yes.
*  The other viral moment, I think I know what you're referring to, was the excerpt in the
*  Sam Bankman Freed conversation, right?
*  That's correct.
*  There are really two of them.
*  But there's one that's gotten most of the attention, where I asked Sam, would you keep
*  on playing double or nothing with the world's population at, you know, 51 to 49 odds?
*  And he says, you know, yes, I feel strongly about this.
*  And I say, well, everything's going to be destroyed then.
*  And he's saying, well, there's some chance you'll end up creating something wonderful.
*  And it did seem that captured something about his approach to many different things that
*  was immortalized in that moment.
*  And if I may sound self-satisfied for just a second, I was very pleased that I had the
*  insight to ask him exactly that question.
*  Yeah.
*  So we got several questions on Twitter about the SBF conversation.
*  Joseph Walker specifically asked, before everything unraveled, in the moment, what did you did
*  you think that that 51 49 question was a red flag?
*  And I'll add on to that.
*  How did your perception of SBF change during the interview, right when everything was unfolding,
*  when that tweet went viral, and now we're in the middle of December, he's just arrested?
*  How have you shifted in your mental model of SBF?
*  Well, SBF, you know, was and is extremely smart.
*  He proved that in the interview.
*  Anything you can throw at him, he can come back very quickly.
*  Maybe you don't like the answer, but he has fully understood the question and answered
*  it in some manner.
*  And actually, not that many guests can do that.
*  But at the same time, then, and obviously now, it seemed to me there was something quite
*  reckless about the plan.
*  I didn't at all imagine how things turned out.
*  I just thought there was this view that FTX could become the exchange for everything,
*  that that belief seemed to me absurd, and that if I asked him some questions about risk
*  tolerance, I thought he wouldn't be able to answer them well.
*  He answered them incorrectly to keep playing double or nothing, but he answered them very
*  well in the sense the response was immediate.
*  The reasoning was in some screwy way internally consistent.
*  He had thought about it before and so on.
*  So that made me less optimistic about his future prospects.
*  The prediction I was making privately at the time was simply that he had ignored regulatory
*  risk.
*  At some point, the regulators would shut him down.
*  The value of the concern would go essentially to zero and it wouldn't work.
*  But again, I had no sense of the underlying, I don't even know what to call it.
*  Fraud is too simple a word, but this is to say the shenanigans.
*  Yeah, my impression, one of the things that I appreciated that he mentioned that I responded
*  to was he mentioned this need to focus on operationalizing what you're trying to do
*  and having people who can coordinate and make things happen.
*  And then as I've seen what's happened, it seems like a big part of the problem was that
*  operationally they were a mess.
*  That's right.
*  And he said that is what is truly scarce.
*  So he actually had a deeper understanding of the scarcity of good operational talent
*  that I realized at the time.
*  But the other thing he said that reads very differently in retrospect when he praised
*  Elon Musk and said, Elon's greatest achievement is not Tesla the car, but Tesla the brand.
*  And that's interesting for at least two reasons.
*  First, Tesla the brand has changed quite a bit since Elon took over Twitter in many people's
*  But also the sense that what a company really is is just its image and you can skate along
*  with that.
*  I really did not pick up at the time.
*  That's what he was saying, though.
*  It's quite clear when you read it that I should have picked it up at the time.
*  And when you reread it in light of what's happened, you get a sense of like, oh, he
*  presumably thought that way about FTX.
*  As long as like the brand was strong, he could always somehow trade his way out of trouble.
*  One effect of the fallout with FTX has been on the affected altruism community.
*  In particular, Will McCaskill, who's a guest on the podcast, was involved with some of
*  the FTX philanthropic projects.
*  One of our guests on Twitter asked, what do you think is the future of the movement?
*  Do they need new leadership?
*  How are they going to recover?
*  Speaking of branding, how are they going to recover from the fallout?
*  With one of the biggest personalities of Earn to Give now being, you know, wholly disgraced.
*  It's hard for me to say.
*  Sometimes losing some funding can help a movement because what's really strong are the ideas.
*  And if I think of, say, libertarian ideas, they were really very strong in the 1970s
*  when there was not much money attached to it and actually relatively few people.
*  But you had very strong thinkers.
*  You have Milton Friedman, Bob Nozick, others, and a great deal of impact in the late 70s
*  throughout the 80s, some of the 90s.
*  And the better funded movement maybe never matched those achievements.
*  So I don't really have a prediction for effective altruism.
*  But I don't think we should hold this against it.
*  I think leadership at open philanthropy is excellent.
*  And whatever, you know, virtues or qualms you might have about the movement, it's continuing.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Switching back to looking at the year in conversations, if we run through the numbers, we released
*  28 episodes this year.
*  So our usual amount plus a few bonus episodes.
*  That's counting this one.
*  That's counting this one as well.
*  And do you have a sense of what the most popular episode of the year was?
*  I never have a good sense of this.
*  If you count that viral clip, I'll say Mark Andreessen.
*  If you don't count the viral clip, maybe, you know, SPF will overtake all the others
*  whether or not it has done so yet.
*  Those would be my guesses.
*  But I suspect I'm wrong.
*  Chuck Lasterman maybe was popular.
*  So you tell me.
*  Good guess.
*  This one is surprising to me.
*  And we're looking just at podcast downloads and not sort of overall impression.
*  So it may well change if we factored those in.
*  But the top downloaded episode this year was Tamar Piketty.
*  Piketty, OK.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought people were a little tired of all that.
*  I was very surprised by the response to that.
*  But it's the most popular episode this year, most popular episode in terms of the first
*  week of any episode so far.
*  It was a good episode because you got to see this clash of different points of view, I
*  thought.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm amazed people stuck with it because it was the audio quality was a little rough,
*  but people stuck with it and were very engaged by that episode.
*  I have a sense people are liking sort of debates.
*  So my episode with Byron Auguste, which I certainly liked when we did it, but it's proven
*  to have longer legs than I would have expected.
*  And it's just a very clear case of two people debating labor market value of education.
*  How can we get people without college degrees into jobs?
*  In a very stark way, Jeremy Grantham was a bit like that, debating environmental issues
*  in a very stark way back and forth.
*  He even apologized at the end for being a little, what was the word he used?
*  Not grumpy, but combative.
*  And I was like, yes, you know, combative, please bring it on.
*  Please teach our other guests to push back when they need to.
*  And Mary Gateskill, I think, is someone who, not combative, but you said, I think on Twitter,
*  maybe it was your post-unmarginal revolution that this is someone who doesn't feel the
*  need to impress you and just is giving you her thoughts on the matter and doesn't particularly
*  care whether you think they're here, there, or anywhere.
*  It's just what she thinks.
*  And that's what we're here to listen and learn from.
*  And it was one of my favorite moments of the year when she has to end the episode a few
*  minutes early because she's really hungry and just says that, not some kind of polite
*  excuse.
*  I'm really hungry.
*  Did we include that in the episode?
*  Yes, we did.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yes, we did.
*  We can.
*  Yeah, I remember listening to that when I was reviewing the episode.
*  And yeah, it was.
*  I need to keep stuff like that in.
*  We're kind of touching on it already.
*  But what are your picks for underrated episodes of this year?
*  Let me let me preface that by saying this year, a pattern I saw was I feel like the
*  dispersion has gotten tighter in terms of listens, that there's really just two tiers
*  this year.
*  There's like the people who really got a kind of a surge and maybe did 15, 20 percent better
*  than the than the second tier.
*  But there wasn't like these clear sense of like, oh, people just didn't tune into that
*  one.
*  It was sort of like either it was really popular or it was just pretty good.
*  And how do you model that?
*  We're less dependent on external celebrity.
*  There is what I'd like to think is that people are accepting the value of the CWT Tyler Cowan
*  filter and they're giving episodes every episode a chance.
*  Now, if I if I peer deeper into looking at how long people listen to episodes, maybe
*  you'd see more drop off on some of those less popular episodes.
*  But that's what I'd like to think is that they're at least giving giving everyone a
*  chance.
*  Like if they're on the show, they're probably pretty good.
*  So let me at least tune in.
*  Whereas before, I think we had more of the problem where someone if it was an unknown
*  name or we've talked before about some of the biases people have in terms of women or
*  actually even people with accents, you know, they might just be like, I can't I can't listen
*  to this.
*  Maybe that's not been such a factor this year.
*  But what's your pick for underrated?
*  Vaughn Smith, the polyglot and carpet cleaner.
*  I think that's probably is an underrated episode.
*  The people who listen to it seem to quite like it.
*  I already mentioned Roy Foster.
*  Ireland just doesn't have that larger population.
*  But that was a great take on Irish history.
*  I liked most of them, I have to say.
*  So, yeah, I had I think a lot of them are properly rated.
*  Yeah, I had Roy Foster and Vaughn Smith.
*  I would throw in, you know, if you look at download counts, like maybe Lydia Davis, a
*  performed well.
*  And then I personally really enjoyed Walter Russell Meade.
*  I could absolutely.
*  It was just a great back and forth.
*  And you could have him on an endless number of times and he would always have something
*  to say. He's one of those kinds of guests.
*  Now, speaking of Roy Foster, are you going to accept the Roy Foster challenge to go to
*  Ireland and check out their database and look up the Cowens?
*  That was the one question, you know, he wouldn't engage with you on is tell me tell me a bit
*  about the Cowen clan.
*  That surprised me because they've had a prime minister Cowen.
*  Right. Yes. He would have known of him.
*  I think I would sooner fly to Salt Lake City and to Ireland for that purpose.
*  But I don't know how I would ever know that it were my Cowens.
*  Right. So you could see a bunch of Cowens from, say, some county.
*  Well, are they my Cowens?
*  Are they his Cowens? I don't know.
*  Like, what's the actual bridge?
*  I think to hire someone who's worked in Salt Lake City archives would be a better approach
*  than for me to be digging around in a library.
*  Or maybe we should do get you on Finding Your Roots and with Henry Lewis Gates.
*  Yeah, maybe we can. We've we've asked Henry Lewis Gates to be on the show and he
*  famously hosts Finding Your Roots where he takes celebrities through their family history.
*  I think it's time for a Tyler Cowen episode of Finding Your Roots.
*  I believe mine is quite a New Jersey history with no roots in the South.
*  Moving on to some more Twitter questions.
*  James Brole, I think the Mary Gidskill interview, speaking of underrated, was one of the most
*  interesting of the year, largely because of her genuineness coming through so strongly.
*  So here's a question. What makes a guest more genuine or authentic?
*  And I should mention that's Mercatus research fellow James Brole.
*  And also, I believe you advise his PhD.
*  Right. Yeah, Jim's great.
*  He goes by Jim. Jim.
*  Can I call him Jim Brole? I don't know.
*  You have to call him James. I can call him Jim.
*  OK, being a CEO makes you less authentic.
*  Now, one thing about Mary, she's quite well known as a writer, but the outlets that
*  interview her are not.
*  They're not mass media.
*  There'd be places like Book Forum and she's she has no fiduciary responsibilities per se.
*  And if people come away with the sense that she's unusual or quirky, there's no problem
*  in that for her.
*  So people who are loan operators tend to be more authentic.
*  Vaughn Smith, the polyglot and carpet cleaner, I thought was extremely authentic.
*  So he's hardly ever done any interviews before.
*  He was extremely articulate, but just you got Vaughn Smith, I'm pretty sure.
*  So people who are not used to arguing in the media and not used to being criticized,
*  they approach it more innocently in a good way.
*  Yeah. Do you think do you think people on conversations with Tyler?
*  Well, Ken Burns would be an example of someone some people joked on Twitter.
*  And I knew having worked for him and seen his media interviews, people joked that he
*  had the conversation he wanted to have.
*  That is correct. And Ken is very good at delivering eloquent
*  monologues that may or may not actually relate to the questions he was asked.
*  But he knows how to hit the points he wants to make.
*  So he's, to my mind, an extreme outlier in the sense that he has a very clear
*  direction. He wants to take interview questions and he's very good at it versus
*  other people who are maybe self-conscious and then all the way on the other side,
*  people who just kind of don't even think about the fact that they're on the
*  podcast. What are some do you do you do you have a sense of that in the interview
*  of are they very aware that this is going out to a lot of people?
*  And I forget that often as they're speaking now, you know, can and I don't
*  other than that interview. But I had the sense that maybe that was the
*  authentic Ken Burns, right?
*  It is the authentic Ken Burns.
*  That is that is how he is. Yes.
*  So in a way, he was the most authentic guest, though it would not have appeared
*  that way to someone who didn't know better.
*  Yes, I can say as someone who listened to him, I worked in the production house
*  where he was editing films and when he was talking about, you know, reviewing a cut
*  of a movie and talking about what needed to change, he is just as eloquent talking
*  about something on the fly that needs to change in a movie, recalling very specific
*  details from what are often three, four hour cuts of what needs to be cut down to
*  maybe an hour, hour and a half.
*  He has an amazing mind for that and can deliver that on the fly very eloquently.
*  So, yes, you're absolutely right.
*  That actually is very authentic.
*  Ken, I thought John Adams, the American composer, was also quite authentic.
*  He was willing to be grumpy, to complain about film music, to say the music of
*  Belize is a kind of torture to listen to.
*  I'm pretty sure it's what he really thinks.
*  Yes. And he didn't have to say those things.
*  And he was polished.
*  But I felt you got the actual grumpiness of the man.
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  John Adams is fun for me because I told you before the fact that one thing that I
*  find fascinating about John Adams is that I discovered him because his music was
*  featured in the game Civilization 4.
*  And in that game, you build a civilization and there's different eras.
*  And when you get to the modern era, they play John Adams music.
*  And I found it so immersive and perfect.
*  And when you asked him that question in his interview, he thought about some
*  commercial where his music, he was very upset about the commercial, but he didn't
*  respond to the game.
*  And I it's just fascinating because I don't think he actually cares that much.
*  But there is a whole generation of people probably about my age who love John
*  Adams music because of the game Civilization.
*  It's his largest audience by far.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  And so his saltiness is kind of like I'm good with that.
*  I still enjoy the music and I enjoy listening.
*  I enjoy recalling that that time in my life as well.
*  It brings me back.
*  It's very vivid for me.
*  OK. Joseph Yow.
*  On which topics do you do your views have the highest error rates?
*  Why? Error rates.
*  Well, what are the topics that are hard to predict?
*  So who's going to win a contest in most areas?
*  It's hard to predict. Not in chess.
*  Magnus Carlsen just played Karawana.
*  He in his speed, he beat him 22 to four and didn't lose a single game.
*  And that was not hard to predict.
*  The margin of victory was hard to predict, but not that Magnus would win.
*  But if you ask me who will win the NBA title this coming year,
*  very hard to predict.
*  The history of China is very hard to predict.
*  So switching from zero covid to covid free for all, I was not predicting.
*  I don't think I got that wrong publicly, but I know in my own mind,
*  I wasn't expecting that China in general does very rapid shifts
*  that are hard to predict in advance and a way say that India does not.
*  So my backup answer after sports would be
*  China is very hard for me or indeed anyone to predict.
*  Yeah.
*  Pavel Grachev asks, who would you love to have on your podcast,
*  but can't because of the language barrier?
*  It seems to me, from what I've seen on YouTube, that Michelle Hulbek
*  does not speak English very well.
*  So I'm not sure how good a guest he would be, but I would love to have him
*  in any case, just to see what he would be like.
*  And there are possibly languages, a barrier.
*  Various rural Mexicans, I know, whose first language is Nahuatl.
*  But even in Spanish, I don't think I would quite be good enough
*  to make for a satisfying podcast.
*  And most of our listeners don't understand Spanish anyway, I'm pretty sure.
*  So they would be some fascinating guests,
*  but there would be logistical difficulties.
*  The people I might interview in German
*  pretty much all speak good enough English if we want to do them.
*  Yeah. So those would be some answers. OK.
*  And related, Corey Paddock asks, who are the guests you'd like to have,
*  but were unable to secure? Paul McCartney.
*  Everyone knows that, right?
*  You don't even know how to ask him.
*  But you also figure he's just not going to do it.
*  He's Paul McCartney, right?
*  Yes. And I pulled up the list.
*  We have reached out to many, many guests who we either haven't
*  heard a response to or they've said no.
*  So just going through some of the highlights, Charles Barkley,
*  David Bentley Hart, William Shatner,
*  Tilda Swinton, Haruki Murakami.
*  Let's try Shatner again, because he has a new book out.
*  Yeah, I think we did. Yeah, we did.
*  We did. We checked after the new book came out.
*  Mark Cuban, Mr. Beast, the YouTuber.
*  Dolly Parton.
*  Oh, she would have been great.
*  How about the Thai film director whose name I can't pronounce?
*  He just did Memoria and he did Uncle Boon Me.
*  Why don't we ask him? He does speak English.
*  OK. Real time, real time
*  guest suggestions going on.
*  And that would be a coup to get him.
*  And I suspect he's not asked all that often and he might be quite authentic.
*  OK. Yeah, we have Werner Herzog would be another name.
*  Hans Zimmer, Peter Zeihan, Stanley Tucci.
*  So actually, early this morning, you released
*  a blag on Marginal Revolution and asked for guest ideas.
*  And we've got some good new ideas,
*  but some of some of those names have either been asked or they've been on our long list.
*  And so before the recording, Tara and I were talking about triaging
*  some of those and reaching out. But we have.
*  What's wrong with these people?
*  I mean, seriously, I question theory.
*  We don't have afraid the thought too busy.
*  I think the standard the standard filter is if it's not coming through
*  a personal connection, you know, don't even don't even bother with it.
*  So I doubt I doubt some of these have actually gotten to the actual person.
*  So if you're listening to this and you have a connection
*  to any of the names you mentioned or just someone you think would be good for the podcast,
*  please reach out. I am Jay Holmes.
*  I'm a cadet, G.M.U. dot E.D.U.
*  Send me an email because we'd love some personal connections with some of these people.
*  And they can email me too, you know, either way.
*  And it's online. Yeah, it's online.
*  OK, moving back to Twitter questions.
*  OK, here's I want you to answer this rapid fire because it's it's
*  just answer this as quickly as you can.
*  It's it's kind of a it's kind of a grab back question.
*  Fikash Palit, what are the so there's three questions.
*  What are the pluses and minuses of ending the Fed?
*  What are the top three ways you would change the U.S.
*  health care system?
*  What's the ideal tax system look like?
*  According to you in reverse order, the ideal tax system is a progressive
*  consumption tax with a relatively light rate of taxation on capital income,
*  though it can't be zero because otherwise people will reclassify their labor
*  income into capital income.
*  Best ways to change the health care system.
*  A lot of that is frozen into place.
*  I'm more focused in my current roles on improving the rate of progress in science
*  and getting more innovation and reforming the NIH and NSF
*  and making them more dynamic and quicker to respond to change.
*  So people don't usually call that the health care system,
*  but that would be my emphasis.
*  And if you look at, say, the mRNA vaccines or what seems to be coming against
*  malaria, against dengue, possibly against cancer,
*  that's yielding huge dividends and fighting over the scraps of like Medicaid
*  expansion or something ultimately seems to me like a misallocation of talent.
*  Ending the Fed, what do you replace it with?
*  You can't answer that question in the abstract,
*  but I suspect what you replace it with will not do better.
*  The price of gold is much too volatile to have a gold standard now,
*  even if you liked the classical gold standard.
*  I'm not sure it was better than the Fed, but it wouldn't be workable now.
*  And what Bitcoin, that's that's a nonstarter, right?
*  So replace the Fed with what?
*  Just a frozen stock of dollars.
*  Again, seems to me worse than what we have now.
*  All right, Vikash, you got your answer.
*  Answers, answers.
*  Mark Bisbal Arias, what is the thing you are most excited about
*  or looking forward to next year?
*  The next 28 guests on Conversations with Tyler, right?
*  Could it could be anything but are you committing a cart?
*  Are you walking into the studio, you know, singing?
*  Maybe I'm amazed for us and we're the ones who are amazed.
*  OK, next year, 28 guests, Paul McCartney, Brian Eno, Verner Herzog.
*  They're all coming in.
*  They will all be in the Mercatus studio.
*  Mark, my words.
*  Twitter user Breaking Extent asked, does Tyler think TV shows are a waste of time?
*  Have you watched many TV shows this year?
*  Well, for whom are they a waste of time?
*  I haven't watched a lot of TV this year.
*  I plan on starting the new Disney plus show Andor, which is very good.
*  And my other friends tell me the same.
*  So I think I like that.
*  I don't know that I found anything good other than the new season of
*  Barthigan, which came to the US this year.
*  That was excellent and very different from the earlier years.
*  Yeah. Grumpier, more cynical about politics.
*  You could say more right wing in the Danish sense, which is not the same
*  is more right wing in the American sense.
*  And that was great.
*  But I think that's all I've really liked or even watched.
*  Natasha starts some things and I turn away quickly.
*  Most TV, it seems to me, it doesn't interest me.
*  I much prefer movies.
*  Yeah. What does Natasha put on that you turn away from?
*  Do you even do you even recognize what it is?
*  I think there's some show is it called Hackers or Hacks?
*  Hacks. Hacks.
*  The comedy, the show about the stand up comedians.
*  Is that what you're thinking?
*  I'm not. I didn't get far enough.
*  It's on, I think HBO Max.
*  Yes. It's about a it's about a kind of an elder statesman,
*  female comedian who's, you know, doing her show in Vegas.
*  That's right. Yes.
*  It seemed to be backed by talent, but it's just not for me.
*  It's not informationally dense enough, not challenging enough,
*  somehow constructed to string people along through subsequent seasons,
*  which is the commercial incentive.
*  I get that no grudge held here.
*  But now I'd rather watch, you know, the movie Tar.
*  I loved Memoria. I loved.
*  I haven't seen Tar, but that that's that's been a big movie this year
*  that people have really, really responded to.
*  And St.
*  Omer, the French Senegalese movie was excellent.
*  I saw that a few nights ago at AFI in Silver Spring.
*  So movies to me way above TV,
*  but I don't think it's a mistake for most people.
*  Yeah. All right. Why don't we use that as an entree?
*  We'll come back to some Twitter Twitter questions,
*  but let's go to 2012 picks and see what your favorite movies were in 2012.
*  So in your post, you say Hollywood continues to collapse
*  into mediocre tentpole franchise.
*  That's true. Which is absolutely true, because this that was the Marvel decade,
*  among other things.
*  But overall, it has been a splendid year for movies.
*  Here were some of my favorites, noting that I count by the year I saw them,
*  especially for foreign films.
*  So not necessarily a year of release.
*  So here we go. One, a separation.
*  I've taught that movie, I think, five times since then.
*  So I rewatch it every year and it's incredible.
*  It's one of the best movies, period.
*  It's an Iranian movie about a couple who are separated
*  and the difficult decisions they face, what to do with the daughter
*  and whether or not they should leave her on.
*  A plus.
*  Yeah, I watched that movie.
*  Yeah, I watched that on this recommendation and enjoyed that movie.
*  And my students love it also.
*  Two, Jiro Dreams of Sushi.
*  I haven't rewatched it.
*  I have fond memories of it.
*  I hear people cite it still.
*  That's a good sign about a movie.
*  So I'm still very favorably inclined.
*  It's probably now a little underrated because that style of documentary
*  that was especially so food focused, but the story itself was very compelling,
*  has now become the same filmmakers went on to make series for Netflix called Chef's Table
*  and they've taken that format and now it's become TV.
*  And so now I think if someone went back and watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi,
*  they would be like, well, what's special about this?
*  I can put this up on Netflix at any time and hear someone's dedication to food
*  and also some story about their biography that reveals why they're so obsessed
*  or something that gives you insight into why they are the way they are.
*  But I suspect the movie is more subtle and the TV show is too literal,
*  would be my guess, not having seen the television show.
*  You don't have as much time.
*  So they're more like vignettes and that was much more of a deeper study,
*  not just of the master chef, but also his sons,
*  because that was a key part of Jiro Dreams of Sushi was the sons who were,
*  I think, in their 40s, but were still in the shadow of their dad.
*  And clearly one of the subtext was, when is he going to let us
*  step into this role and take on the mantle?
*  Three, Marley.
*  Marley.
*  Oh, the Bob Marley movie.
*  That was fantastic.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a very long movie set in Jamaica.
*  Excellent.
*  And I don't think you have to love the music of Bob Marley to watch it as a movie.
*  Once upon a time in Anatolia, and you added,
*  boring for most people, big screen only, I suspect.
*  I mean, every movie is that, but especially slow moving foreign films.
*  It's just much harder to pay attention at home.
*  But again, seemed to me a very strong movie.
*  And that, now that I am hearing these titles, was just a great year.
*  Four movies, though not Hollywood movies.
*  Okay. Well, here's where it gets very Tyler Coward sideways, your next two movies.
*  Next one, The Dictator, which is the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy.
*  It's aged poorly.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think he's aged poorly.
*  Okay. I was going to ask.
*  Some of the TV show is still quite good, I think.
*  But you were a big Ollie G fan.
*  Is that your favorite character of his that he does?
*  Yes.
*  He's Borat, Ollie G, other ones I can't even remember.
*  The mini episode where he interviews Donald Trump is a double plus.
*  And Trump just immediately sees the guy's a fraud
*  and just walks out and says, you know, good luck.
*  Yeah.
*  So the peaks are high, but it's not really watchable anymore.
*  Okay. Dictator.
*  And then next one, The Three Stooges.
*  This is the comedy remake of The Three Stooges.
*  I think it was a Fairleigh Brothers movie.
*  The original is too good, I think is the problem.
*  I'm very surprised that made your list.
*  I'm not sure what I'm just trying to think about what you found in that movie
*  that you were like best of the year.
*  Next one, The Raid Redemption.
*  Better Indonesian martial arts you will not see, you say.
*  Nor have I seen better Indonesian martial arts since then.
*  And a thrilling movie.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to be up for that kind of movie.
*  Yeah.
*  But the best one in a long time.
*  The Raid is a strong favorite of a lot of people I know.
*  Your Sister's Sister.
*  This is an indie movie with Emily Blunt, Rosemary DeWitt, Mark Duplass.
*  I don't remember it, so I guess I have to give it a thumbs down.
*  You say it was Straussian.
*  I'm not familiar with it.
*  Maybe it was too Straussian.
*  Circo, Mexican circus movie.
*  Hasn't stuck with me.
*  Okay. Let's go through these.
*  You've got quite a few of them, so let's go through them quickly
*  and you see if you respond to any of them.
*  Take This Waltz, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Margaret,
*  which I think is a Margaret Thatcher documentary.
*  Nope.
*  No, no.
*  Totally wrong.
*  It's a...
*  That was quite interesting.
*  It's a narrative movie with Anna Paquin.
*  Yeah.
*  But Beasts of the Southern Wild really has stuck with me.
*  And it's a portrait of a certain way of life that you find only in America.
*  And this movie shows that way of life better than any other movie.
*  Ai Wei Wei, Never Sorry.
*  I think he's milked it too much at this point and become a marketer.
*  So that...
*  Not the movie is a movie, but all that has gone down in my eyes.
*  Not that interesting anymore.
*  Samsara.
*  Again, another one you say.
*  This probably only makes sense on the big screen.
*  Say the name again.
*  Samsara.
*  It is...
*  I'm looking it up.
*  Filmed over a period of...
*  It's not a narrative movie.
*  Almost five years and in 25 countries,
*  Samsara explores the wonders of the world from sacred grounds to industrial sites.
*  That movie, it's just visuals.
*  And it's great as visuals on a large screen,
*  but a huge mistake to click on Netflix.
*  It's just not going to do it for you.
*  Searching for Sugar Man.
*  Incredible movie.
*  And I saw him in concert a few years ago.
*  He's the South African star who...
*  Well, he's from Detroit and he became a huge star in South Africa and didn't even know it.
*  And he learned this quite late in his life.
*  Yes.
*  It's this country full of people, a lot of whom worship him.
*  And excellent music in concert.
*  Still a wonderful film.
*  Unique, original, memorable.
*  Day, night, day, night.
*  I don't think I'd ever heard of this movie.
*  The description is a gripping drama that falls a young suicide bomber
*  on her mission to wreak havoc in Times Square.
*  It was good.
*  One of these movies that's focused on one thing and does it well.
*  Yeah.
*  And some people just don't get it, but a good movie.
*  And then you added to a week or two later, you added Lincoln, the Steven Spielberg movie.
*  No, it's too sappy.
*  It's aged poorly for me.
*  People react strongly because Spielberg has this movie coming out, The Fablemen's.
*  Which is excellent.
*  And I thought I would hate, I saw that movie, and I was like, hey, I'm going to watch it.
*  Which is excellent.
*  And I thought I would hate.
*  I saw the preview.
*  The preview was unwatchable.
*  The marketing for it is generally considered really poor to give you a sense of what the movie is.
*  But you also kind of gave a brief Spielberg ranking.
*  And I think in particular, you suggested that some of his most commercially successful,
*  like Jurassic Park, are his worst movies.
*  That's right.
*  And ET is not very good.
*  I'm with you more on ET, but Jurassic Park?
*  The novel is better.
*  It seemed to me too Hollywood, too manipulative.
*  The special effects are now completely out of date, and that made the movie so much better.
*  Actually, that's one of the things that people think is aged well, is the special effects.
*  They're definitely moments, but because the mix of practical and special, it's aged pretty well.
*  Are you wrong on that, Tyler?
*  I don't know.
*  I will absolutely agree with you, though.
*  I'm glad we managed to bring Michael Crichton into this, because Crichton, who wrote Jurassic
*  Park and Lost World and many other science fiction stories, by far my favorite author as a kid.
*  I loved Michael Crichton and I loved those books, but I still love Jurassic Park.
*  Lost World is another story.
*  He was a tremendous art collector and he wrote a great book on Jasper Johns.
*  He would have been a first-rate CWT guest.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  You know, I actually emailed you, this is before I worked at Mercatus,
*  but when Michael Crichton died, I emailed you and asked you if you would write anything.
*  I think you said nothing particular is occurring to me to say that would be of any value,
*  but I loved Michael Crichton.
*  Sphere is a wonderful book.
*  I think you've said it was one of your favorite.
*  Maybe my favorite, yeah.
*  Yeah, Sphere is quite, what do you think of the movie Sphere?
*  I didn't want to see it because it would wreck the book for me, so it got so-so reviews.
*  I just stuck with the book Andromeda Strain, of course.
*  Very, yes, quite relevant.
*  Okay, and then the last one you added was Life of Pi.
*  I would like to see it again.
*  I found it engaging at the time.
*  A lot of smart people I know turned against the movie.
*  Maybe it's too manipulative or too corny or too, in some way, condescending like toward India
*  or maybe Bollywood, but it touched me nonetheless.
*  I think it's probably still a good movie.
*  I didn't watch the movie and I didn't particularly enjoy the book.
*  It was obviously a big book.
*  I don't love the book, so that's why it took me so long to see the movie.
*  Okay, moving on to books.
*  Favorite fiction, Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl.
*  Is it Gillian Flynn?
*  Gillian Flynn.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I don't know either.
*  Gone Girl.
*  Well, it's become really quite famous.
*  It's fun and engaging and totally manipulative, but it's become a thing,
*  and I think that I picked it as to my credit, if I may say.
*  We've either considered her or outright asked her to be on CWT.
*  I'd have to check my notes.
*  Gone Girl, I have read the book.
*  I've read the screenplay, which she also wrote, and I watched the movie.
*  Sometimes I do that to just see how do you adapt something, especially if it's the same author.
*  It's interesting the choices you have to make going from novel to screenplay
*  and then seeing what actually made it to screen.
*  Next one, Nell Freudenberger, The Newlyweds.
*  Yeah, forgotten.
*  Alonso Cueto, The Blue Hour.
*  Peruvian, excellent novel.
*  Peruvian literature is a thing, underrated.
*  Not all of it's translated.
*  I have a few in Spanish in my pile to read, but it takes me so long.
*  I don't know when I'll get to them, but that's a very good book.
*  Peter Siss, The Conference of the Birds.
*  You say it's mostly illustrated, beautiful in any case.
*  That's the old Persian poem.
*  I think so.
*  Let me look it up.
*  This is celebrated children's book author, his first book for adults,
*  a beautiful and uplifting adaptation of the classic 12th century Sufi epic poem.
*  Yes, and that's a wonderful poem.
*  Definitely recommended.
*  And there's a new translation of that that came out a year or two ago that's also very good.
*  Alice Monroe, Dear Life Stories.
*  She's a double plus, read everything by her, one of the deepest writers and thinkers.
*  And you said, I can confidently put this on my list without having read it yet.
*  I was right.
*  And then you add, I was disappointed by most of the well-known novels to have come out this year,
*  including the Tom Wolf Unreadable, I'm not sure which one that was, and McEwen,
*  OK, but not distinguished.
*  Mantella is somehow too dense for me and I do not enjoy it, the fault may be mine.
*  I'd rather read history than her stuff.
*  Sad to say that in a year when she passed away, but it never clicked with me.
*  All right.
*  Favorite nonfiction books.
*  First one, Charles Murray, Coming Apart, the State of White America, 1960 to 2010.
*  It's now so well known, but it was quite ahead of its time.
*  And the notion that parts of the nation were in some way coming apart, he completely nailed.
*  So that's an important book.
*  But do you need to read it now?
*  You've heard it too many times.
*  So I would say in that sense, no, but definitely a big hit for Murray.
*  OK, you've got a lot of these.
*  So let me run through these fast and you can jump out.
*  You can say anything, if anything, jump out at you.
*  David Ackett Fisher, Fairness and Freedom, the History of Two Open Societies, New Zealand
*  and the US.
*  Everything by him is great and we should consider having him on as a guest.
*  Look at this.
*  People are going to be like, oh, I'm going to read this.
*  I'm going to read this.
*  I'm going to read this.
*  I'm going to read this.
*  We should consider having him on as a guest.
*  Look at this.
*  Some people recommended that in the comments today.
*  Oh, there you go.
*  George Dyson, Turing's Cathedral, the Origins of the Digital Universe.
*  I wonder how that would look today.
*  I think good, but there's been enough other books that it may not.
*  It's not so special anymore.
*  Probably you don't need to read it, but I think it's still fine.
*  John Gertner, the Idea Factory, Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation.
*  Great topic, great book.
*  Excellent author.
*  Michael Dürer.
*  More important than before because the corporate lab has appeared increasingly important with time.
*  Michael Dürer, On Conan Doyle or The Whole Art of Storytelling.
*  I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes.
*  That's a good book.
*  Dürer is a very smart guy.
*  I love to stuff for the Post.
*  So yeah, it's good.
*  James Fallows, China Airborne.
*  It is out of date, but at the time it was in some ways the best analysis of the problems
*  in China and Chinese business.
*  Different ways in which lack of trust meant you could not manufacture certain very high quality goods.
*  Again, it is fairly out of date, but still an excellent book for its time.
*  Greg Wolf, Rome and Empire's Story.
*  So many Rome books.
*  Somewhat forgotten, but I don't mean that as a slight.
*  It was probably quite good.
*  Reach out to Tyler for your Bollerab on the next Rome book.
*  So many Rome books.
*  The number of sources is limited.
*  So there's new archaeology.
*  But until we read those, you know, burnt codexes and the like,
*  just rehashing with another interpretation,
*  it's diminishing returns.
*  Maybe better to read the Romans.
*  I don't know.
*  It's hard, hard at the margin to improve your understanding of Rome, I find.
*  Odd Arnie Westad, Restless Empire, China and the World Since 1750.
*  Very good book.
*  Oh, there aren't that many good books.
*  On Chinese history, that will be intelligible to a Western reader, but that's a good one.
*  Robert Kaplan, The Revenge of Geography.
*  I like geopolitics.
*  Some of the claims are overstated.
*  He generalizes too much, but that's better than a writer who won't tell you anything.
*  Barry Eichengreen, Dwight Perkins,
*  Khan Ho Shin, From Miracle to Maturity, The Growth of the Korean Economy.
*  There are way too few books on Korean economic growth.
*  That's one of them.
*  Excellent on facts.
*  Quite boring in terms of style, but just for what it covers and what it does.
*  Strong recommendation.
*  So those are your picks.
*  I did not.
*  I may have missed it, but I didn't see music picks from 2012.
*  But what do you think your picks?
*  How have they aged overall?
*  Well, by whose account?
*  You know, do I still like what I liked?
*  Mostly, but that doesn't mean they've aged well, right?
*  Yeah, not the dictator, not the three stooges.
*  Can't get over that, Tyler.
*  Sorry.
*  All right, let's go back to I tell you what, let's go to production function.
*  This will be easier this year in one sense because you only explicitly asked it three
*  times this year.
*  I know you kind of embed it in the conversation and it comes up more organically,
*  but was there any intent this year, especially just literally not even saying the words
*  production function or kind of getting a lot into to process as a discrete segment?
*  Was there any intent behind that or just just happened that way?
*  If listeners like something too much, maybe you should move away from it.
*  That's the intent.
*  You get trapped or caught in your own memes a bit.
*  As I sip from myself recommending mug.
*  Exactly.
*  So that's why I did less of it just to kind of screw with people like, well, you thought
*  you like this.
*  Now I'm going to take it away from you.
*  But I'm still interested in the question.
*  Tyler, you're a cruel mistress.
*  Okay, let's do the three though.
*  Okay, first of all, so I will read out the answer to the production function question
*  or where they talked about it and you guess the name.
*  Okay, quote, my dad is a good guy.
*  I think it showed something about my interest in taxonomy.
*  He's talking about bug collecting, I believe.
*  I think bug collecting showed something about my interest in taxonomy, which is probably
*  not unconnected to later becoming a baseball reporter as I became a stat head in high school
*  and in college.
*  So there is probably a story to tell there.
*  It's got to be Chuck Losterman, right?
*  It's not Chuck Losterman.
*  It's a good guess though.
*  Who is it?
*  It's Jamal Green.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  You asked him a question as dad.
*  Okay, number two, there's a huge amount of power in being quantitative.
*  There's a huge power in thinking about things, not just from a qualitative angle,
*  but putting numbers on things, building statistical models, doing that in a world where
*  you know you're forgetting an enormous number of factors.
*  How do you do that?
*  I think that is one of the core things here, getting quantitative numerical when it's really
*  hard to do so.
*  Was that SDF?
*  It was Sam Bankman Fried.
*  Indeed.
*  It was your first question was a production function question.
*  So he emphasized the quantitative and putting numbers on things.
*  So.
*  And learning how to count.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, third and last one.
*  Frankly, I don't understand people who go quiescent intellectually as they get older.
*  In a way, getting older, you get more control of your time and you have more savvy on how
*  to do things and how to make things happen, who to call when you have a question and all
*  that stuff.
*  So your ability to investigate stuff, especially with the internet now,
*  is going up all the time.
*  Why would you let curiosity fade?
*  Sounds like either Mary Gates, or Lydia Davis.
*  It's Stewart Brand.
*  Stewart Brand.
*  Stewart Brand, who up until Jeremy Grantham was our oldest CWT guest.
*  I think Grantham Dallas, is that right?
*  Jeremy's two months older than Stewart.
*  Dallas floor, other CWT producer confirms that there's two months difference between
*  Stewart Brand and Jeremy Grantham.
*  I'm glad someone knows these things.
*  Who is our youngest guest ever?
*  Ooh, good question.
*  Any guesses?
*  I don't think it was anyone from this year.
*  Anna Vitovich is young.
*  I don't think she's the youngest.
*  She was the first guest this year.
*  Patrick Collison would have been 27.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if he's the youngest, but he must be close.
*  Yeah, I would think that it's someone probably in their late 20s would be the youngest.
*  And we've taught, we have reached out to people younger.
*  We've reached out to teenagers.
*  Tavi Gevinson we tried, right?
*  Yeah, and there's been several people like that who have done something exceptional.
*  Some of them have been like headline newsmaker type people, and we've tried to get them on,
*  but for various reasons, no dice.
*  Let's try someone else very young.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's something you've talked to us explicitly about.
*  I'm a little reluctant that if they're that young, it's not that I think they'll screw it up,
*  but they do get branded by the episode.
*  And that's a responsibility on our part that makes me a little nervous.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's some people where you know that will be fine.
*  And I would want to make sure it's a young person in that position.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there is there.
*  You have to be careful the younger they get.
*  There's definitely people who are CWT worthy, but there's a lot of people who are
*  there's more to consider for them in coming on the show, to be sure.
*  Switching on to some of the questions I had, and we get a few minutes to have the conversation
*  I want to have.
*  It's all been the conversation you want to have, I believe.
*  That's right.
*  Especially the Three Stooges part.
*  Yes, the through line of this episode is the Three Stooges remake for 2012.
*  Absolutely none of our listeners remember, but it does exist.
*  Just paying tribute to the original Three Stooges deserves a mention, I think.
*  So I don't regret having put it on the list.
*  Are you a Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello?
*  What's your ranking?
*  I watched a lot of Abbot and Costello as a kid because my father did.
*  But I have to say I never found it funny.
*  I think you can see roots of Larry David in Abbot and Costello and that I find interesting.
*  But no, it's unwatchable.
*  Like who's on first?
*  It's just not funny.
*  Laurel and Hardy, there's a bit.
*  W.C. Fields, the bank dick, I like better.
*  Charlie Chaplin, I like better.
*  Buster Keaton, I like better.
*  Most early comedy I don't love, and I think that tells us something about the nature of comedy.
*  I'm an Abbot and Costello guy.
*  I think I watched the most of that.
*  And I think some of that holds up.
*  Others, maybe not so much.
*  The best movie is with Frankenstein and the Wolfman.
*  Yes.
*  It's actually a good Frankenstein and the Wolfman movie.
*  I watched that movie many times as a kid.
*  Yes, it's very good.
*  All right.
*  You wrote one of your big Marginal Revolution essays this year.
*  Last year you did one on state capacity libertarianism,
*  and this time you did one on the new right.
*  Yes.
*  What was your thought process going into that?
*  You said for the SCL one, the state capacity libertarian one,
*  that you were typing it with glee, that you knew it would be kind of a
*  poking the bear or something.
*  For the new right, what were you trying to accomplish for yourself and for your readers?
*  Well, when I go to events, I very often meet quite smart young people.
*  And those who are not on the left and who are not effective altruists,
*  those who are on the right, they tend more and more to be some version of the new right,
*  for lack of a better term, even though that's a quite diverse set of views.
*  And I wanted to write a piece that would actually try to persuade those people
*  and make them more in the direction of classical liberals,
*  but recognize what it was they might be correct about,
*  but still give reasons why I thought they weren't on the proper path forward.
*  So that was my thinking there.
*  I think it's the most influential piece I've written this year, is my guess.
*  Probably the most widely read as well.
*  Are these movements now just getting fast and furious?
*  Is that one place in which things are getting more dynamic and changing all the time?
*  Tyler's going to be writing a new essay on some new intellectual or political movement
*  that's coalescing.
*  Probably.
*  So there's a lot of fracturing.
*  Old views are breaking down.
*  With the internet, everyone's eclectic.
*  So there's always more to write about in terms of other people's views.
*  You had a book come out this year with Daniel Gross called Talent.
*  How did that tour go?
*  How did it compare to previous book tours?
*  Any noticeable differences?
*  The tour is still going.
*  So I'm still giving talks, webinars, whatever, about the book quite often.
*  A lot of institutions are using the book in a way that I find rewarding.
*  I'm not sure I'm free to let on what they all are, but some pretty good places.
*  I think the book has a remarkably dedicated set of readers.
*  Sort of per reader, it's the most influential book I've written in terms of changing something
*  about practice.
*  Of course, a lot of the credit there goes to Daniel.
*  So I've been very happy with how the book has gone.
*  Did anyone ask you your question, which is what are you working on next?
*  Anyone in a podcast?
*  Anyone in that kind of press tour?
*  You said that no one needed, you mentioned that one of the things no one ever asked about is,
*  what's your next book or what's your next project?
*  Did you get that this time?
*  I did a few times.
*  So I've always been thinking about a sequel with Daniel.
*  I don't think that will be the next thing.
*  I don't think we have replenishment of fresh material on a rapid enough basis.
*  And I'm writing a book, my take on the greatest economists of all time,
*  Hayek, Cain, Smith, Malthus, Mill, and why they're interesting or where they went wrong.
*  And that's pretty far along.
*  It's over three quarters done, I would say.
*  Oh, that's exciting, Tyler.
*  I'm excited.
*  But it won't come out soon.
*  So there has to be the paperback of talent that will take a while.
*  Then that goes through the paperback of talent prevents us from learning about
*  the talent and economics.
*  That's exactly right.
*  In a funny way, this is a sequel to talent.
*  It's case studies.
*  So you were on R.T. and Srim's Good Time show.
*  One of the questions they presented to you was about the NBA halftime show.
*  And you said you really liked it.
*  And you liked it because the people argue with each other, but they seem to love each other.
*  They're really highly analytical, but trying to get to the truth of things.
*  This is the TNT show in particular with Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith.
*  Shaq and Ernie.
*  They're not always analytical, but they have fantastic chemistry
*  and they know how to make it work.
*  And it's one of the best things to study, I think, to understand podcasting.
*  Yeah, he mentioned in the context of podcasting.
*  And do you know where that format came from?
*  Originally?
*  No, because it was an intentionally created format to have.
*  How do you have something on TV that's argumentative, but compelling and insightful?
*  Right. And they use visuals very well, too.
*  Yeah. And one of the...
*  Readers can correct me.
*  Listeners can correct me if I'm wrong here.
*  But I believe one of the sources that people point to that format
*  is actually the Siskel and Ebert show that started in the 80s.
*  And that was the thing that they figured out is how to have two
*  people who were a little cantankerous and a little antagonistic, but fundamentally love movies,
*  had two different points of view, and could argue about a movie in a way that was still instructive.
*  And it took them time to dial that in.
*  But one of the big producers of sports shows on ESPN directly credits Siskel and Ebert
*  with giving him the idea to do shows like the halftime show.
*  I didn't know that. That's great.
*  And it took a while for them to work Shaq into the group.
*  And it's fine now. But at first I was like, this isn't going to work.
*  It took Siskel and Ebert. And I think this is an instructive lesson for everyone.
*  It took them a while to figure that out.
*  It is very difficult to make that work and to operate in that environment,
*  whether you're on a podcast, NBA halftime show, or talking about the movies.
*  It takes... And this is something I think we think about at Mercatus all the time,
*  is how do you have that insightful dialogue where there's some tension
*  but you know you're trying to get to the truth of the matter?
*  And that is a really powerful format for actually developing understanding
*  and insight for things that sports has got to figure out.
*  And Seinfeld did also. Early Seinfeld episodes are pretty iffy, right?
*  But at some point it becomes funny and interesting.
*  Yeah. I have to say I'm not a Seinfeld person.
*  I like Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm.
*  He's better. It's a more pure thing. But for ensemble work,
*  I think Seinfeld is where one goes.
*  And Seinfeld we have, I think, had a direct line to.
*  We did have a connect with Seinfeld and we sent an invitation pre-COVID,
*  I think, or maybe during COVID. But no luck with Seinfeld.
*  But I think he would be a really good guest as well.
*  We should try Larry David.
*  And Larry David.
*  We can promise not to ask about crypto.
*  Who also.
*  Yes. But weirdly Larry David, even though he was marketing FTX,
*  he played the guy who thinks it's a bad idea.
*  So he's coming out aces on this.
*  Lastly, I forgot to ask one of the most important questions of this retrospective,
*  which comes from fellow CWT producer Dallas Floor.
*  She says, I saw Limp Bizkit in concert this past summer
*  and it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to.
*  What are some of Tyler's best or favorite concerts you've ever attended?
*  Master musicians of Jaduka.
*  They're a Moroccan, I would call them a noise band.
*  That's one of the best shows I've ever been to.
*  Seeing live gamelan music in Bali is one of the best shows I've ever been to.
*  The Paul McCartney tour in the early 90s.
*  Seeing Roger McGuin and Gene Clark play at NYU in what would be, I guess,
*  was the mid 1980s was a top show.
*  Those are like a few that come to mind off the top of my head.
*  I saw Horowitz play at Carnegie Hall once, piano.
*  He did Beethoven, Opus 101, Schumann, Carnival, some other great work, some Chopin.
*  That was amazing even though it was not Horowitz at his peak.
*  Ushida playing Mozart was incredible.
*  So many for top concerts.
*  I wouldn't know where to stop.
*  Those are good picks.
*  I'm not sure how they stack up against Limp Bizkit though.
*  Okay, before we close, let me give a shout out to everyone on the team who helped out this year.
*  That's Limp Bizkit fan Dallas Floor, Morgan Hamilton, Kate Delanois, Sloan Argyle, Caroline
*  Baer, Karen Plant, Christina Behe, Hayley Larson, Katie Kindernacht, Anna McVeigh, and Ashley
*  Schiller.
*  If you count all the people that helped out here at Mercatus with live events and things
*  like that, it'd be a much longer list.
*  But we thank you for all your help and we look forward to another year in conversations.
*  Thank you, Jeff.
*  Thank you, Tyler.
