# Conversations with Tyler 2021 Retrospective  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T2lsFBAK5A)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to Conversations with Tyler.
*  My name is Jeff Holmes.
*  I am not Tyler, but I produce Conversations with Tyler and we're doing our 2021 Year
*  In Review.
*  This is the third time we've done it.
*  And Tyler, to start off, I just have to say it's great to see you in person.
*  Good to see you in person as well.
*  I have tested negative five times this week.
*  I feel incredibly safe then.
*  I will not develop a cough or a scratchy throat on my way home then.
*  I take it.
*  So the last time I saw you was April of 2020 here in this studio.
*  Actually, we were recording the TETLOC episode and that was the last time I think we've seen
*  each other.
*  Amazing.
*  All right.
*  To start, I thought the question everyone wants to know, Tyler, is how has life changed
*  for you since you were featured on Ancient Aliens on the History Channel?
*  I didn't even know I was featured on Ancient Aliens on the History Channel.
*  I will say in a variety of public settings, people ask me, what are my latest thoughts
*  about UFOs?
*  And that's the main way in which my life has changed.
*  It seems to be now quite clear that the data the Navy are picking up are real.
*  It's not a mistake of the instruments or bad eyewitness reports.
*  That doesn't mean the UFOs are aliens.
*  I give that something ranging between one and 10 percent, depending on my mood on a
*  given day.
*  But it seems to me a major puzzle, no matter what it is, and it should change all of our
*  lives more than it does.
*  So last year when we were talking, you mentioned we're referring to the John Brennan episode
*  where this came up and you, I had not listened to the episode yet, but you said, you know,
*  John Brennan talks about UFOs, it's going to be big.
*  And it was quite big.
*  It got picked up a lot.
*  And yes, you were on Ancient Aliens, season 16, episode 9.
*  Were they nice to me?
*  Did they mock me?
*  I'm going to throw to the clip, but it's very odd to see you and John Brennan on Conversation
*  with Tyler in this studio.
*  Virtually you're in the studio, Brennan virtual, but you're just sitting there and Brennan
*  is talking about aliens.
*  And Marginal Revolution University is now in a Nobel lecture, right?
*  It's a strange world we live in.
*  This is all going to plan.
*  In other words, this is very much in the 10 year plan for Mercatus Center comms, and I'm
*  glad to see it's paying off.
*  Whose simulation are we living in?
*  Right. That's the updating we need.
*  So actually, that was a Twitter question.
*  I'll go ahead and ask it.
*  Are we living in a simulation?
*  This was prompted by the David Deutsch conversation.
*  I'm never sure what it means to be living in a simulation.
*  So if there's a high school kid with a project, the project is to simulate a lot of beings,
*  then it's well defined.
*  But is the universe as a whole a simulation?
*  I don't think has a comparably clear answer.
*  If you view the universe as somehow just being about computation in the broadest sense of
*  the word, it seems under all scenarios, the universe as a whole, properly construed, is
*  a kind of simulation.
*  So in that sense, are we living in a simulation?
*  Almost certainly.
*  Are we the product of somebody's experiment?
*  That seems less likely to me.
*  I simply think that civilizations tend to perish before they can create these truly
*  grand simulations.
*  So the Bayesian reasoning of, well, each civilization creates so many civilizations, you need to
*  reason backwards and assume you're in one.
*  I don't think that works.
*  So basically, no.
*  But the medieval point that in some sense, the universe is a simulation in the mind of
*  God, can you treat the mind of God as a simulation and so on.
*  At the macro level, people I think are confusing those two questions rather too quickly.
*  Does Robin Hansen's paper on grabby aliens influence you at all on this in terms of like
*  civilizational collapse and things like that?
*  I think in Robin's work on grabby aliens, he's trying to infer too much from seeing nothing.
*  In my view, we know so little about the parameters of the problem that what we can infer from
*  seeing nothing is pretty close to nothing.
*  And we don't quite see nothing, right?
*  So you asked me about UFOs before.
*  Maybe that's only a 1% chance that it's some product of an alien civilization.
*  But no, I think we are mostly in the dark when it comes to grand speculations about
*  the universe and how settled it is with life.
*  So I don't agree with Robin's work, but I'm glad he did it.
*  It's very thought provoking.
*  Yeah.
*  And so we may be in the dark about whether we're alone in the universe and the future
*  of civilization, but we're less in the dark about some predictions you made this time
*  last year.
*  So I thought we could revisit them and see how they fared.
*  Let's try.
*  Let's hope I can remember the actual reality as well as the prediction.
*  So last year, I asked when you'd have your first normal movie theater experience where
*  you just buy a ticket, you show up, you don't know anyone else.
*  You're not renting out the whole theater, which is what I was doing.
*  Correct.
*  OK, you suggested it would just be like three weeks after your second dose.
*  So like or whenever you had achieved full immunity.
*  Do you remember when you saw that first movie and what it was?
*  I don't remember what the movie was.
*  I strongly expect I went to the movies as soon as I could, which would be like two or
*  three weeks after the second dose.
*  I think my second dose was March 1st.
*  So probably sometime in March.
*  There wasn't much to see, you know, but I was willing to see crap.
*  But I don't remember.
*  How many movies did you see in a theater this year, roughly?
*  I would guess 30, 30.
*  Fair number.
*  I saw three.
*  You're you're you have small children.
*  Yes. And one of them was with the small child.
*  And it was a great experience of her first movie theater experience.
*  So it was fun to have the opportunity to do that.
*  That was, in fact, my first back to the movies experience was watching Ryan the Last
*  Dragon for anyone who's wondering at home.
*  I went on a binge once I could.
*  What can I say? Intertemporal substitution.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  So I asked about the first in-person conversation with Tyler in general, first one on
*  one interview in person.
*  You suggested it would be in February.
*  In fact, it was in June and it was with Alexander the Great.
*  But that was outside.
*  He lives outside.
*  Yeah, it would have been it would have had to be in person and outside regardless
*  of covid. Correct.
*  So I hadn't foreseen that he is a man with what without permanent residence.
*  Is that the no fixed address?
*  No fixed address. Yeah.
*  And if two of us all in the longer run.
*  Yeah. And then in terms of a live CWT where we have a live audience, we both thought
*  we would do one in twenty twenty one.
*  But in fact, the first one we're doing is going to be in January.
*  And that is going to be just for Mercatus folks.
*  It's not even going to be open to the public.
*  It'll still be somewhat of a closed event.
*  We didn't foresee Delta, right?
*  Like many other people.
*  Otherwise, I think we would have had one.
*  Yeah. So I was going to ask what what does what did those predictions about CWT in
*  particular reveal to you about the state of what we were assuming would come in twenty
*  twenty one? Well, as second doses were becoming available, my modal prediction was
*  that there wouldn't be a major new variant of import.
*  I certainly was aware of the possibility, but I thought by very late in the year we'd
*  have a vaccine mandate and have in a maybe not huge audience somewhere for a guest.
*  But with Delta and now Omicron, it's still not going to happen for a while.
*  That's what I got wrong.
*  Right. OK, let's go through the numbers on conversation with Tyler.
*  So this year we released.
*  So this will be the last episode of the year and we'll have released twenty seven
*  episodes with the possibility of a twenty eight twenty eight because you're potentially
*  doing a bonus episode with Russ Roberts.
*  Correct. So if that release is in December, that'll be the twenty eighth of the year.
*  How many do you think we did in person?
*  Is it zero? No, it's not zero because there's Alexander Rubinstein, Alexander the Great.
*  So I guess I'll say two.
*  And you're missing David Sally three.
*  Ah, of course, David Sally.
*  That was a good episode in his studio.
*  In his studio.
*  Obviously, I think you would have predicted for reasons we've just gone over that we would
*  have done more in person.
*  And we could have done more, but it just turned out to be OK enough to do them not in
*  person. And other people were afraid even if we weren't.
*  Right. And I think like a lot of people were learning that that the the benefits to
*  remote are the logistics are easier, the access is greater.
*  And so I would expect going forward, it'll still be we'll save the in-person.
*  Maybe for special guests.
*  But but the remote has really worked out well in terms of giving us access to a more
*  diverse set of guests.
*  It's easier to be snippy with people remote.
*  That may be good or it may be bad.
*  But I find that's one difference.
*  But for me, a big motive in doing these is getting to meet the people.
*  So remote in that sense makes it less desirable for me.
*  I'm still going to do them.
*  But I miss meeting all the people.
*  Yeah. And I like airports, actually.
*  Really, I genuinely honestly do.
*  And yet I seem to recall in your interview with Larissa McFarquhar, you talked about
*  how if you could have like one sort of superpower ability, I can't quite remember
*  how it was framed. But you said just eliminating like instantly being able to travel to
*  a place. Oh, sure. But that's like getting to Uzbekistan.
*  So if we're like flying to Albany to see Lydia Davis or something, it's not nearly as
*  hard. And I wouldn't say I like flying, but I do like airports.
*  Yeah. Airports are underrated.
*  I agree. And the food in them has gotten better and better.
*  What's your favorite airport for food?
*  Well, Singapore, obviously.
*  But Chicago, I like pizza and so on.
*  Most airports now are pretty good for food.
*  They're good enough. Yeah.
*  Atlanta used to have a very good restaurant.
*  One flew south. I'm not sure how good it is in the past few years, but it was
*  excellent. OK, so in August, you wrote a podcast really works when it is the
*  dramatic unfolding of a story and mood between the guest and host.
*  And in September, we had our most downloaded episode.
*  That was Amiya Srinivasan.
*  Yes. What was your intended story or mood there?
*  And how do you think it diverged from what was actually perceived by the audience?
*  She gave much more what you might call fundamental pushback to my questions than I
*  was expecting. So I thought it made for a very good podcast.
*  I really liked it. I think she's super smart.
*  If someone wants to sort of fight a war over the terms of discourse, my view is bring it
*  on. You know, one should respect that.
*  But I thought it would be much more a kind of internal exploration of aspects of
*  different arguments.
*  And it wasn't. It was how can you even ask this kind of question response from her?
*  So that was a bit new for conversations with Tyler.
*  But again, that's great. One of my favorite episodes of the year.
*  And the people either hated it or got very upset at her or some of her fans maybe
*  hated me. But that's a sign it had some resonance, right?
*  It did have resonance. I mean, I was not aware of it until I looked at the stats.
*  I knew that there was chatter about it online, but it's the most downloaded and also
*  the retention. The amount people listen to was quite high, too.
*  So they weren't listening to it and turning it off and discussed.
*  They were in disgust. They were actually listening to almost all of it, in fact, on
*  average. Many people are remembering that podcast.
*  That's my sense. People still talk to me about it, write me about it.
*  Have you thought about your how would you describe your interview style?
*  And I'm tired in particular with with her.
*  Do you think that it was your style as an interviewer that caused that to go
*  somewhat off the rails?
*  I don't know. I think my style for my conversation with her was a little bit
*  different. So if someone does philosophy at an abstract level,
*  they're virtually asking or forcing you to challenge them more than would be the
*  case, say, if you're interviewing a CEO or a general.
*  So I thought it was a kind of respect to her argument to try to challenge its
*  premises empirically or otherwise.
*  And that's not the case with, say, you know, Pierpaolo Barberi, who has a startup.
*  And I asked him about his sector, but I was asking him to explain to us how it
*  works. So it was very different.
*  But relative to her being a philosopher, I don't think it was so different.
*  I think that's how you should interview a philosopher you respect.
*  Yeah, I think you could say that your interview style is very masculine because it
*  is it tends to be more abstract and about getting to the point.
*  And what do you really think about this?
*  But also, that's a more philosophical approach.
*  And so one thing I was socratic.
*  Right. And so one thing I think drove some of the reaction to
*  it, the negative reaction was exactly that, which is there was a feeling that it
*  sort of didn't follow what the standard should be given her profession.
*  Do you think that's fair? Or as you said, you were happy she pushed back.
*  But should people do that more?
*  When people interview philosophers, they should take them more seriously and
*  actually try to get it, whether their propositions are correct.
*  It seems to me too many people stick in the typical interview mode of tell us
*  what's in your latest book or what's up with these incels anyway, or, you know,
*  how does this argument imply feminism should evolve for the next century, which are
*  like, OK questions, but they're too open ended.
*  They're inviting a kind of blathery response.
*  Right. So when I interviewed Richard from the ornithologist, anyone who does birds,
*  you figure is looking for some kind of specific pointed questions about birds.
*  And he got those.
*  So maybe he was the only one who got an interview like that.
*  But relative to him being an ornithologist, he still got the Tyler Cowan style.
*  Yeah. So the one thing I'll say is I was very happy to see that it was, in fact, so
*  well downloaded and listened to.
*  We definitely see in the stats that listeners are not willing to give certain
*  episodes a chance.
*  And one of the factors is maybe the topics a little more obscure, but it's pretty clear
*  that one of the factors is also whether they're a woman.
*  They're just one of the great injustices of podcast life underreported.
*  So I will say this year it's better news.
*  I think actually the the female guests who are featured this year, Patricia Farah,
*  Sarah Park, they all did pretty well.
*  But perhaps it was also aided by the fact that they were talking about things that
*  speaks to a typically male audience.
*  So it was like the classics and Newton and archaeology.
*  But when you have someone who's talking about feminism, well, maybe I'll skip that one.
*  And that's not what I want.
*  I already know what that's going to be about.
*  I think on average, the women on conversations with Tyler do better than the men.
*  And the difference on average is they're rarely or never willing to just be a blowhard.
*  They always feel they have to say something of actual substance.
*  And it's interesting that that is the difference.
*  But I prefer the podcast with women as a whole.
*  Yeah. And I would say as a simple heuristic, if you are considering you listener,
*  if you're considering skipping an episode, that is in fact a good sign that you should
*  absolutely listen to it.
*  I think that only for our podcast, right?
*  Not for other people's podcast.
*  Fair enough. I'll say for our podcast, though, I feel like that's been generally true for me.
*  It's a pretty good you are subscribing to a show in part because you are recognizing a
*  the host's ability to curate or select people who are interesting, certainly for conversation
*  with Tyler, but for a number of other interview shows as well.
*  And so by virtue of that guest being on the podcast, that's a certain certification that you
*  should spend some time with him.
*  Now, for other shows, there's more of the grind of production.
*  Like we have to get an episode out.
*  Maybe this person just got a book to promote and I don't have a personal connection.
*  But you're very much on the record of saying you don't have anyone on you don't actually
*  want to learn from.
*  And so that may not be true anymore, by the way, but I'm not going to name names.
*  Some people ask you and you figure you should do it like they're very famous.
*  Like, how can I say no?
*  It may bring in some new listeners, but I'm not sure I can say that about every podcast
*  this year to to.
*  Yes, to say that another way, I think if you were looking for the overrated episodes of
*  conversation with Tyler, you would not be looking at the women.
*  Correct. This year.
*  And it's the famous people who sometimes are a bit, you know, the ones to be suspicious
*  of. Yeah.
*  Compensating differentials.
*  Right. So we talked a little bit about overrated.
*  What's your pick for underrated episodes?
*  You know, I don't see the listened to numbers.
*  The Ruth Skirwan on Napoleon in 18th century history was excellent.
*  I'm not sure it's like incredibly popular, but that's probably underrated.
*  David Sally.
*  A lot of people just are not connected to the visual arts and painting.
*  That's probably an underrated episode.
*  Richard Prum, the bird guy.
*  I thought he was one of the very best of the year.
*  I and people like Chris Blattman loved it, but I'm not sure in terms of numbers.
*  I thought we had these three in a row.
*  Sarah Parchek, Dana Joy, Ashadi Bartch, like the three best CWTs in a row ever.
*  And I hope people realize they got that from us.
*  Yeah, I think my two picks would be Richard Prum, which definitely underperformed a
*  little bit. And I think people maybe just said like, or anthology birds.
*  What do I care? But you're really missing quite a lot by missing by skipping that
*  episode. And then the other one I would submit is Dana Joy.
*  And I think for me, the thing that unites some of the very good ones, I would count
*  Ruth Skur in this as well.
*  But Prum, Joya, they all had such a passion and enthusiasm and they so clearly still
*  loved what they were doing.
*  Yes.
*  That it is just impossible not to pick up on that enthusiasm and just decide like, I
*  think I should. After I listened to Prum, I started like looking at all the birds in
*  my backyard and like, I really need to.
*  I have like 20 varieties of birds in my backyard.
*  Who would have thought? Joya, I realized like I felt like my life was impoverished
*  because I couldn't appreciate the things on a level that, I mean, he just seems like
*  a person who consumes that you call them an information billionaire.
*  And it's exactly right that he just seems to have such this wealth that he knows how
*  to use. Listening to those was wonderful.
*  And Dana, Dana Joya, along with possibly Neil Ferguson, he's the guest we've had where
*  you can ask him literally anything and he has a good coherent answer.
*  And there aren't many guests like that.
*  And I appreciate that he's one of them.
*  And he's to the point with it as well.
*  And what's remarkable is he sent you an email afterwards saying thank you.
*  It was a wonderful interview.
*  And he said that he had felt like he was in a fog.
*  And this conversation helped him kind of break out a little bit of that fog.
*  And it's it's remarkable, not just because that interview for someone who was in a
*  fog, that interview is remarkable, but also the fact that, you know, we're all in a
*  fog. And so empathizing with him in that way that even this guy who gets so much
*  joy out of things was still feeling a little kind of down on himself was kind of
*  amazing to me. All right.
*  Are you up for some name that production function?
*  Your favorite segment?
*  I'm going to get any of these correct.
*  Your favorite segment listeners as well.
*  OK, let's see.
*  OK, first one.
*  I think I've always been good at finding things.
*  I don't know if it's because I'm just good at pattern recognition.
*  But even when I was five, six, seven years old, I could go to a whole patch of clover
*  and reach in and find the four leaf clover.
*  That sounds like Sarah Parchek, the space archaeologist.
*  Did I actually get one?
*  You got it right. So she's a space archaeologist.
*  So her visual acuity with pattern recognition is something that she still uses to this
*  day. So who would have thought you can pick a four leaf clover out and make a make a
*  career out of it. All right.
*  One for one. Good job.
*  I have that same ability, by the way.
*  I can see like a big shelf full of books and immediately find like a single title.
*  Do you think it's is that a general ability is a very specific to like text, for
*  instance?
*  I think it's general to the visual.
*  Not only text is my sense.
*  So I got a chess board.
*  That's not text, but I have reasonable ability there as well to see a combination, say.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  Second one. This is an anti production function.
*  I'll tell you what I am not very good at.
*  I don't think I'm the most inspiring or compelling person.
*  I've gotten a lot of practice at it over the years.
*  But in terms of the early days, in terms of fundraising, pitching people, recruiting,
*  I was never very good at that.
*  B, B minus.
*  I was enough to get to the next stage, but I never ended up being world class.
*  Is that Brian Armstrong?
*  That's Brian Armstrong.
*  He's underrating himself, but that's fine.
*  Yeah. He he gave himself some credit for talent recognition and managerial ability.
*  I think it was, but he just doesn't think he's got the sort of charisma that he feels
*  like he should.
*  But his earnestness comes through, as indeed it did on that podcast.
*  And he may be underrating how much other people value his earnestness.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  Two for two.
*  All right. Here's the third one.
*  The instrument that I play is really just dialogue and discourse.
*  I've got a strongly evolutionary mindset in this notion of emergence.
*  I think that if you're doing something that's never been done before, you have to be very
*  humble, recognizing that you don't know what the right thing to do is, but also nobody
*  else does.
*  In that milieu, you need to create a culture where people are willing to say things and
*  be wrong so that others can say other things.
*  And over time, whatever is right can emerge.
*  I have no idea.
*  Nubarifying?
*  You're right. OK.
*  Yeah. He was talking about that in the context of running Moderna and
*  many other companies, many other companies, allowing people the scope to make bad
*  arguments because it gets you to the good stuff, which I think is a theme we were
*  talking before the recording of Get Back, the Beatles documentary of just kind of giving
*  the sludge and just Paul was big on like, we just got to play it poorly so that we can
*  get somewhere good.
*  That's right. And it worked for him.
*  Yeah. Nubar was also really good because we titled that one The Permission to Leap.
*  On the permission to leap.
*  That's what he one of his core ideas.
*  And it was this idea that there comes a point where societal factors, policy factors,
*  whatever, give you that permission to take a big step.
*  And in that case, it was this vaccine development.
*  Why have we not leapt more in 2021?
*  It feels like we were heading in when we had this conversation a year ago, like
*  vaccines were approved, took longer than it should.
*  But we were looking forward to widespread vaccine availability and surely things
*  would get better. And it still feels like we're in a new administration.
*  It's a new policy regime.
*  It still feels like we're not able to make the leaps.
*  The permission to leap is not there.
*  Why do you think that is? I think a lot of older institutions are broken, maybe
*  permanently so. They're just crippled or not able to do anything other than routine.
*  But I suppose I see the variance in our ability to leap is having gone up.
*  So the leapers leap more quickly and leap higher in the biomedical sciences.
*  We're seeing many different innovations against malaria, against dengue, against
*  sickle cell anemia, CRISPR.
*  So there's plenty of leaping.
*  But on average, I don't know.
*  I think this average is over idea.
*  We're seeing an innovation as well.
*  Well, I think I think the innovators are doing it well.
*  But you would think that we would see recognize some things that are like, wow, we've
*  been maybe keeping things a little too tied down.
*  We're a little too risk averse in terms of a societal or policy response.
*  And I guess I'm just I'm still confused that we've seen this miraculous development of
*  the vaccines. And still, there's there's this hesitancy to let
*  like I would suspect that these new vaccines like malaria vaccine will come more
*  quickly, but still it will take far too long.
*  I think there's some change in the news cycle where people just don't care about so
*  many things. They may care for a short while and then it passes and then the new thing
*  is here. So attention switching is much different than it used to be.
*  So if it's something where you need a lot of people behind you to get something done,
*  like to get 90 percent vaccinated, that seems much harder than ever before.
*  But if the mass of people, you simply need them to tolerate what you're doing.
*  And if the law is not hindering you, that may in some ways be easier than it used to
*  be because the attention switching is so rapid.
*  It's harder for them to prove an obstacle.
*  Now, we have a bunch of problems vaccinating people, testing climate change, where you
*  need active participation from a lot of people.
*  And there we're having problems.
*  But the other class of innovations, I think we're kicking butt.
*  So it's a weird world.
*  Higher variance, I think, is the key.
*  All right. You're you're three for three on production function.
*  Can we keep the trend?
*  All right. Fourth one.
*  People who stayed with me in my house have told me that I have a habit of which I was
*  completely unaware that I sit upstairs where I'm sitting now in my study and I work on
*  my computer. Then about every half an hour, there's an enormous bang and I stamp
*  around the room, around the room swearing.
*  The people in the house are terribly worried that something has gone awfully wrong.
*  Then I get back to work and everything resumes as usual for the next half an hour.
*  And then it all happens again.
*  I was completely unaware that I did that until several people have told me that I do.
*  But it seems to work.
*  That sounds like Neil Ferguson, because he has a summer house in Wales, right?
*  In Wales, things go bad.
*  I agree that it sounds like Neil Ferguson, but you're wrong.
*  But I'm wrong.
*  You broke the streak.
*  Who is it?
*  This is Patricia Farah.
*  Ah, OK.
*  Yeah. Surprising answer, I think, because she's...
*  But same country.
*  Yes. Same energy.
*  Yes.
*  This is my favorite from the year, I think, because I think actually it describes an
*  element of my own production function is that I talk to myself and I often get very loud
*  and obnoxious and sometimes I scare other people that are around me and have no idea
*  I'm doing it.
*  So me and Farah got that in common.
*  OK.
*  Let's do two more and then we'll we'll call it quits.
*  My favorite onion article was titled NSF Studies Show Science is Hard.
*  What is people's response to that?
*  The fact that science is hard.
*  A lot of people will go and say, well, if I'm going to expend a lot of energy, I better
*  do something that somebody else thinks is important.
*  They look to the sides and they think that doing something somebody else thinks is
*  important is their mission.
*  I think about the research subject and I think what is the coolest thing that I could
*  do with my time now or this day, this next day ahead of me that would solve something.
*  I have no idea on that one.
*  Maybe I'll guess Daniel Carpenter, but that's a stab in the dark.
*  His his research subject that I removed for context clue is birds.
*  Then we know Richard from Richard from.
*  So Richard from his basic his basic point was he loves birds.
*  He loves birds and that guides everything he does.
*  He doesn't particularly care about grand research agendas or revealing the answer to
*  big questions.
*  He just wants to discover something cool about birds.
*  What do you think? Is that a general approach that should be followed or is that maybe
*  unique to or anthology?
*  Richard is a great person to study, I think, to learn how to be successful.
*  And that is to care more than the others.
*  You have to do more than that.
*  But it's a great starting point.
*  All right. Last one.
*  The most important thing you can do in that remaining part of your life must be
*  intellectual succession and planning.
*  Academic life, in my view, has gone off the rails in ways that I never would have
*  imagined in the 1980s when I was starting out.
*  We need new institutions and I want to spend more time on institution building and
*  less time on book writing and whatever time is left to me.
*  And that should strike terror in my enemy's hearts.
*  And that is Neil Ferguson, the terror in the heart.
*  It's like the whole Scottish thing, Sir Walter Scott, you know, the thump in the
*  attic in the Welsh summer home.
*  And he's gluing us in that University of Austin is ready to come.
*  Right. And I heard him say that I'm thinking, so what's he actually going to do?
*  And I didn't know. And now I know.
*  So you're an adviser or what's your capacity on University of Austin?
*  I'm on the advisory board.
*  I don't govern. I don't work on it any particular day.
*  I was asked to be on the advisory board, keen to see what they do.
*  I think innovation and higher ed should be encouraged, but I'm not part of the
*  process.
*  So a listener on Twitter asked, what do you think is going to be different there
*  based on what you see at the University of Austin?
*  You know, we're very close to T sub zero in University of Austin planning.
*  So I'm not sure how much anyone knows, but I think they will genuinely teach
*  classic works.
*  They will genuinely court STEM majors and give them a rigorous education.
*  I think they will attract a fair number of students.
*  The push I gave them in the chat I had with their president was to really be
*  a radical university and not just not be woke, but to change pedagogy quite a
*  bit in innovative ways that took a lot of chances.
*  I genuinely have no idea how much they will or will not be doing that.
*  But that was my advice as someone on the advisory board.
*  So if it were just like a better St.
*  John's with more STEM majors, well, that would be great.
*  I love St. John's as it is.
*  Maybe they're underperforming relative to what they could be and could do.
*  And they ought to think big and have founder energy and overturn the world.
*  We'll see.
*  So speaking of founder energy, if we're sort of thinking about it in terms of
*  starting a company or venture capital or whatever, I think one thing that worries
*  me about it, maybe it's too early in it, but I don't see people dropping everything
*  to join us. And they're not they don't have the skin in the game.
*  So so far, maybe I'm wrong, but so far none of the big professors or whatever have
*  revoked tenure and said, like, I'm full time University of Austin.
*  Is that a concern?
*  I don't know. Yeah, I think the first thing I said is we're very close to T sub zero
*  and the planning horizon. It's just so, so early in the game.
*  I'm not sure they will succeed by getting well-known people to join that strategy,
*  itself might be a mistake. Most well-known people are somewhat older.
*  Nothing against that.
*  But it could be they revolutionized the world by getting a few 23 year old
*  YouTubers on board. Right.
*  Right. And maybe and maybe they should read your forthcoming book on how to spot
*  talent and use that to recruit new professors or non professors as the case
*  may be.
*  The Beatles didn't try to hire Frank Sinatra. Did they? No, of course not.
*  Nothing against Frank. But look,
*  they did joke about getting Eric Clapton at one point to replace George Harrison.
*  They didn't do it. He played guitar on while my guitar gently weeps,
*  but I don't even like his solo that much.
*  So Billy Preston was there really good move. I mean,
*  he was fantastic on all those songs,
*  both on the albums and in the documentary and much better temporary acquisition
*  than Eric Clapton was, I think.
*  Yeah. So I referenced your book last year.
*  I think you said a draft was finished,
*  but sort of that was, that was where it stood.
*  Any updates on the book with Daniel Gross on talent?
*  The book is called talent. It's being published by St.
*  Martin's on May 22nd. About a week ago,
*  we did all the final final proofreading on the galleys. So,
*  but the jacket copy and all that it is done delivered,
*  ready to be published. It will be out in what five months may. All right.
*  I'm very excited. And Daniel has been absolutely wonderful to work with.
*  Okay. So now I thought we could, another listener on Twitter asked if we could
*  revisit some of your picks, culture picks from 2011.
*  I did that two years ago since it was the end of the decade.
*  So we went back to 2009 in that case and looked at your pop culture picks from
*  2009. We didn't do it last year,
*  but since he asked I went back and looked at your picks from 2011.
*  So let's do it. So movies, books, and music.
*  Do you remember anything from your picks then?
*  No, I have no idea. Like what was in what year.
*  Some things are in iconic years like Sergeant Pepper was 1967,
*  but whether it was 2012 or 2011, no idea, especially for books.
*  So we'll do, we'll do movies first.
*  The big one is that you just come out of the gate saying,
*  I didn't like anything from Hollywood or like even Indies in 2011.
*  So almost all your picks are foreign.
*  So the decline of Hollywood had already started. There's so many sequels,
*  a trend that has continued so many tentpole franchises, right? Mostly they're boring.
*  Yeah. So I mean, but how does that compare to this year though?
*  I think a lot of your picks this year are mains, fairly mainstream. I mean,
*  there's Dune, Get Back. What else have you got? Manari. I mean,
*  they're pretty standard fare,
*  like things you would see on pretty much any critics list.
*  I don't think Manari is standard Hollywood fare.
*  Maybe it's standard Indie fare. Get Back is eight hours.
*  It's a New Zealand director. It's reassembled from footage of another movie.
*  It's a documentary of a documentary. It's a fundamentally strange thing.
*  Dune took forever to make. It's a French Canadian director.
*  Movies like Running Commentary on Islam.
*  It's tentpole in the sense that the novel is what from 1965?
*  But it's a weird pick and it's not on a lot of best of lists this year,
*  which I find baffling. It's highly imperfect,
*  but to not put that movie on your list at all, just for the soundtrack,
*  the visuals seems to me criminal.
*  Dune was another of the, one of the three I saw this year.
*  I was glad I did it. Okay. Let's go through, let's go through your 2011 list.
*  Really quickly. Sure. All right. Number one in no particular order, I think,
*  but number one was Incendies. Do you remember what that's about?
*  That is by the same director of Dune. That was his breakthrough. Yeah.
*  That's his breakthrough movie. It's incredible. I didn't know that. I,
*  I, I'd never heard of it. You said it. So yeah,
*  French Canadian movie mostly set in Lebanon.
*  Highly recommended. Oh, whether or not you liked Dune.
*  So that was a good pick. It's held up very well.
*  The director has proven his merits repeatedly. I'm a market agrees.
*  I'm a fan of Denis Villeneuve. I mean, like, uh, there's, um,
*  obviously Arrival was, was great. Um, oh, I can't think of the,
*  the Mexican drug movie. I can't think of the name off the top of my head.
*  Was it Sicario?
*  Sicario. That was interesting. Yes.
*  He is one of the only directors today where when he now makes something I will,
*  I know I will go and see.
*  Well you must see Incendies, but so far I'm on a roll. What's next?
*  All right. Number two, uncle Boonmee, who can recall his past lives.
*  Possibly the best movie of the last 20 years. I, I, I'm impressed by myself.
*  It's a Thai movie. It's very hard to explain.
*  I've seen it three times since.
*  And a lot of other people have it as either the favorite movie ever or like in a
*  top 10 status, but a large screen is a benefit.
*  And if you're seeing the movie,
*  pay very close attention to its sounds and to the sonic world it creates,
*  not just the images.
*  All right. Number three of gods and men. You remember that one?
*  I don't know. The other, the first two picks were better.
*  That's a, it's a loosely based on the lives of some monks in Algeria,
*  French Christian monks. Oh, I thought it was a different movie. Okay.
*  That was pretty good. Yeah, that was good. Number four, even the rain,
*  a Spanish movie filmed in Bolivia. You remember that one?
*  Yes, but not well. Uh,
*  there's a lot of culturally specific movies that draw you in when you watch.
*  Maybe they're not that universal. They're very good movies,
*  but they don't stick with you. That's fine. Yeah. Uh, number five, melancholia.
*  Beautiful visuals, uh, maybe too overblown, but an interesting film.
*  And then a couple other, you gave trials to you. You said,
*  drive with Ryan Gosling had excellent moments and scenes.
*  Moneyball was a good, but not great movie. It was a great movie about business.
*  It was a very good Hollywood movie, but you've already read the book.
*  You know how it's going to turn out. It's all very stereotypical,
*  super well executed, uh,
*  pretty good dialogue in the old school sense of the term. But again,
*  it didn't stick with me, but Moneyball as a concept,
*  I just wrote a book on talent, my goodness.
*  So there should be a movie version of that.
*  And that was as good of a movie version as we might have expected.
*  So it's still a thumbs up. All right. Moving to best books.
*  You had a number of lists of best books, but you had one post that you said,
*  here's essentially your top three across genre. Number one,
*  Steven Pinker, better angels of our nation, of our nature.
*  That book is still talked about, right? I would say a very good pick.
*  Maybe I'm more skeptical about the Pinker worldview than I was back then,
*  but an excellent book.
*  Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs, his bio.
*  You know,
*  I have since heard from people who knew Jobs and or new people who knew
*  Jobs, that the portrait was not entirely accurate. Uh,
*  I can't assess that myself.
*  It's still a wonderfully written book about a very important figure. Uh,
*  but maybe he's too, uh, negative on Jobs.
*  Maybe Jobs just wasn't a foot stomping tyrant who yelled at everyone.
*  He got a lot done. I have an iPhone still in my pocket.
*  So I would say maybe Jobs has aged better than the book,
*  but it's still a great book to read. Just take it with a grain of salt.
*  What do you think of Isaacson generally as a biographer?
*  I know a lot of people liked, I think his Leonardo da Vinci biography.
*  I think if you're looking to read one book on Leonardo,
*  it's a very good first or only book to read. But if you've read,
*  say more than 10 books on Leonardo while it's fine, it doesn't add that much.
*  So I'm happy to recommend it, but it wasn't for me a great experience,
*  but it's a well done book.
*  Who's your, who's your pick for best biographer living? Let's say it's a Rue
*  Skur. Oh, living. You know,
*  I'm right now reading the Andrew Roberts biography of King George the third,
*  the last King of America.
*  And Robert says this wonderful book on Napoleon and a book on Churchill I
*  haven't read yet, but people think is excellent. So I don't know if he's top,
*  but he's, you know, top in my mind right now.
*  He's done great work and the King George book is excellent.
*  All right. And the last one on your best books list, Haruki Murakami IQ 84.
*  I would like to read it again, which is a positive sign.
*  I read some of what I read then,
*  maybe all of it in German because it came out first in German.
*  So for me reading a book in German and in English, that's different,
*  but high marks to it into him.
*  And he should have won a Nobel prize by now. And I say a good pick.
*  All right. I'll run quickly through best music since you had,
*  it looks like 11, 11 picks for best music. So I'll just run through.
*  That's really great.
*  All right. In no particular order, Abigail Washburn, city of refuge.
*  You know, she, I think is good friends with Sarah Parchek, Abigail Washburn.
*  I learned that's interesting. She hasn't done as much lately.
*  I think she's been raising children and she's wife of Bella Fleck.
*  He just came out with the new CD. Her work has held up very well,
*  especially the integration of like Chinese music with bluegrass and old timey
*  and folk sources. A good pick.
*  Licky Lee wounded rhymes. She's a Swedish artist.
*  I haven't followed her lately.
*  She never struck me as a long trajectory artist,
*  but that's still good work. And she had, she had her own sound.
*  It was emotionally resonant. I'm still happy with that pick.
*  James Blake, a couple albums from him.
*  I didn't like his very latest,
*  but his first few are wonderful and create their own sound worlds and had a big
*  impact. A good pick.
*  All right.
*  Let me run through the rest of these and you can react all to them as a mass.
*  Okay. St. Vincent, strange mercy.
*  Okay. Well, let me just, she's become a bigger deal. So a good pick from,
*  what was that 2011?
*  Yeah. You're very, it's a very hipster of you to like have some of these on
*  here. St. Vincent. Yeah. Okay. Quite a, quite a taste maker. Uh,
*  you are. Shabazz Palaces, Black Up.
*  No, it hasn't stuck with me. I'll say not a great pick.
*  Miles Davis live in Europe, 1967. Sure. But that's a no brainer. It was just,
*  you know, released that year.
*  This may be my last time singing raw African-American gospel on 45 RPM,
*  1957 to 1982.
*  Well that's a good pick, but every release in that genre is excellent.
*  So it didn't require any intelligence on my part.
*  Wilco the whole love.
*  You know,
*  I think I only listen still to two or three Wilco albums, the famous ones,
*  Yankee Hotel, Fox Trot. They've become quite underrated. Uh,
*  but they, they've boiled down to like a two or three hour kind of set rather
*  than their lesser albums. So pretty good pick,
*  but I don't listen to that CD anymore.
*  The Smile Sessions, The Beach Boys.
*  Listen to it all the time,
*  including the cuts on YouTube of Brian Wilson doing that in concert.
*  So, uh, incredible pick. One of the,
*  some of the greatest music ever created in the 20th century.
*  If there was another documentary in the style of Get Back for any other musical
*  group, who would it be?
*  Well there is a new Brian Wilson documentary either out or about to come out,
*  which I haven't seen yet. Uh, probably it's incredible. How can it not be?
*  But, uh, he still deserves much more attention.
*  He was the person where Paul McCartney thought this is my rival, right?
*  That says it all. Paul Simon was the other one.
*  Indeed by Oren Ambarchi and Jim Orr-Werke.
*  It was an LP.
*  Indeed. I can't even place it. What did I say?
*  You said a real winner, beautiful sound.
*  Well, there you go. It must be true then.
*  Opeka Pende, Africa at 78 RPM.
*  Again, that's like the old blues cuts, uh, old African popular music,
*  any halfway reasonable collection of it's going to be excellent.
*  Takes no brains or insight, but yes, good pick.
*  All right. And then later in the post you say the artist I listened to the most
*  this year was probably Lonnie Mack followed by John Fahey.
*  The two best concerts I saw were, I'm not going to say this properly,
*  but Sati Graha, Sati Graha at the Met.
*  Sure. I saw that with Yana. We had a, like second row seats,
*  right behind Philip Glass.
*  Oh nice. If we had been producing CWT,
*  you could have leaned over and said, come on,
*  he's on our list and has been since the beginning.
*  More people should listen to Lonnie Mack, the wham of that Memphis man,
*  one of the very best LPs of its, of its age, early guitar hero,
*  incredible blues guitarist has a lot of energy, has founder energy,
*  has a sense of impending death and doom. It doesn't seem that well known.
*  However, like, do you know it?
*  No. Try it. Okay.
*  All right. So how do you, it seems like you're very, uh,
*  you're standing behind your picks. You feel like they've aged well.
*  Well, I'm not sure it's for me to say, but.
*  I think you can only say how well you feel like your picks have stood up.
*  It sounds like you would make them again. In other words,
*  I would make them again. I'm sure I missed stuff. Uh,
*  but they sound somewhat, you know, ahead of their time.
*  Okay. All right. So those are the 2011 picks.
*  And now we're going to move on to a grab bag of Twitter questions. Okay.
*  First one, Jeff McCarty on Twitter asks,
*  underrated or overrated the conversations with Tyler podcast.
*  And I looked and we have a four point,
*  a 4.8 star rating out of five for what it's worth.
*  Are we overrated or underrated or correctly rated?
*  Well, I think the ep,
*  a lot of the episodes with women guests are quite underrated.
*  That would be the point I would make.
*  And maybe CEOs are the overall, the somewhat overrated category.
*  So.
*  So at any given point, as we veer in composition of guests, that's,
*  that's how you want to know the best predictor of whether it's over or
*  underrated. Correct. Okay. The next question, Dwark Ash Patel.
*  Tyler said a while back that one goal of his podcast was to teach people to ask
*  better questions. Is that still a major goal?
*  And how well does he think the podcast has been able to teach that? Well,
*  I apparently have taught him. That's a good question, right? So yes.
*  And equals one, but yes. Well done. Dwarke. All right.
*  Question three from at still fewer.
*  Did Deutsch convince you that Popper's philosophy is more profound than you had
*  thought? Do you think he solved the problem of induction, for example?
*  No, Deutsch convinced me that there's often a lot of hot air behind Popper.
*  He didn't argue very well on Popper's behalf.
*  Deutsch is way smarter than I am,
*  but he seemed to me in some fundamental ways,
*  a dogmatist and not really able to defend Popper very well,
*  that he's made up his mind and you get a particular kind of emphatic statement.
*  But I thought at the philosophical level, his defenses were weak.
*  Someone made the comment and I wonder if you agree with it, uh,
*  that maybe that's just a casualty of the fact that it's only an hour interview
*  and he simply doesn't have the time.
*  And in general your style is to kind of make your point and move on.
*  So does he have the time to maybe go into the depth to give you the deep
*  defense or does he have to on some level, just assert?
*  I think there are ways even in a sentence or two,
*  you could show like higher depth or defensibility.
*  There's this odd feature of Popperianism. It's a bit like Mississianism.
*  It somehow attracts a lot of dogmatists. I don't know why.
*  You would think a philosophy that emphasizes fallibility and refutation,
*  uh, wouldn't do that, but it does.
*  Okay. Next question from at Gasca, uh, asked a number of ones.
*  I think the one I'll pick is, uh,
*  we talked about university curriculum, but if you could do whatever you wanted,
*  how would you change elementary, middle school, high school curricula?
*  I don't think I know enough to say,
*  but intuitively it strikes me as somewhat absurd that we group together children
*  all of the same age. And, uh,
*  there's an obvious kind of staggering problem,
*  but ideally you would want younger children always to be interacting with older
*  children and older children to take on a partial role of teacher, mentor,
*  older peer. So the idea that there's like the second grade, the third grade,
*  the fourth grade in my God, I feel that has to be wrong.
*  And you're inducing the kids to bring out the worst in each other.
*  So I don't know how to fix that,
*  but that's where my attention would point on that assumption that you group by
*  age seems barbaric.
*  Somewhat related to that, but you know,
*  you're thinking about how do you spot talent? You also, uh,
*  think a lot about mentorship and you've set up programs that are to some extent
*  about mentorship and trying to identify talent.
*  Have you thought much about the role of parenting in bringing out the potential
*  in a child either for good or for bad?
*  Well, I've been a parent. I mean, still am, but
*  and now our grandparents,
*  Yana is now grown. So I think, uh,
*  what you are and how you are that is more important than anything you tell them
*  and how you treat your spouse or partner is more important than how you treat
*  them. They will learn by example. Uh,
*  primary contributions tend to be genetic,
*  but at the margin family culture really matters. And you see this,
*  I think it's misleadingly called like tiger mom parenting,
*  but whatever you want to call it, it has worked in some way. Now,
*  it's not my style, but it proves parenting style can work right.
*  And you have to figure out what's a version of that that can work for me.
*  I would agree with you mostly as stated,
*  but I'm in particular thinking too about very young children because I have two
*  very young children. And I think it is about how you, uh,
*  comport yourself and how you interact with your spouse,
*  but also how you treat them and model interactions with them,
*  recognizing that they're not just little adults. And for me,
*  that's one of the hardest things to learn to do is to recognize that
*  a four year old simply doesn't have the emotional development, say,
*  to sort of have a reason discussion on something.
*  And they want to kind of structure from you. They do.
*  Which maybe it's not your intuition to feel totally comfortable providing that
*  because you're used to being reasonable with other people. Right.
*  There are models of education,
*  like progressive model of education like John Dewey that I think in part are
*  premised on this notion that as we become adults,
*  we forget what it was like to actually be a child.
*  And that is one of the core challenges of being a parent is to remember what it
*  was like for you when you were really young.
*  Do you think in general that's an underrated thing that we sort of have this?
*  I mean, how well do you remember how, how you were at three or four? Very well.
*  No, it's hard for me to know how well I have the feeling I've changed less over
*  the years than most people,
*  that I was kind of a bit older, young,
*  and now being older, I'm still somewhat young.
*  But I suspect the main like market failure you see with parents is just their
*  mode of interaction is driven by narcissism or their own problems within the
*  family unit rather than concern for the kid rather than, well,
*  they can't remember what they would like.
*  I would think that's pretty low on the list of what is going wrong.
*  But do you think it's generally true in the sense that,
*  that we may be conveniently or just willing to tolerate a certain kind of
*  mistreatment is the wrong word,
*  but like we will humiliate our kids in ways that we would never humiliate
*  another adult by for instance,
*  having a conversation about them in the presence where you talk about some bad
*  behavior or something. Do you think,
*  I try not to do that. I, you know, can I say for sure I've never done it?
*  John Dewey would be proud. Yes. John Dewey would be proud. But I,
*  I don't find that so difficult to avoid. Like I think in all those ways,
*  you should be quite respectful of your kids.
*  And does that, is that, does that suggest that, you know, for instance,
*  should we actually be in some giving,
*  treating kids more seriously and for instance,
*  like thinking about extending voter rights at a younger age and things like
*  that? Or is that, is that just a different question to you?
*  I'm not sure extending voter rights to kids wouldn't matter much.
*  There's Cosey and bargaining within the family. I would say I'm not opposed,
*  but I'm, but I'm not for it. Uh,
*  it seems to me another intuition I have is children feel less in control than
*  you as a parent realize. So in,
*  in ways that like don't even matter you want to give them chances to feel in
*  control, like of a conversation or an interaction.
*  So just kind of hang back a bit and let them own things and own the structure
*  of your interaction with them more than is typically the case. Uh,
*  I don't have any real evidence that that has positive benefit,
*  but I know it's how I act and it sort of feels to me like at the very least it's
*  good for me. Uh, I don't see that it's likely to be harming them.
*  So there you go.
*  All right. Moving on, uh,
*  Dallas fellow producer of conversation with dialer asks
*  Limp Bizkit's new album overrated or underrated.
*  Since I haven't heard it, uh, it must be underrated by me, right? Uh,
*  but I don't have any other opinion than that. Hi Dallas.
*  Sitting right here.
*  You should check it out. I think it let us know report back. All right.
*  Uh, user at BA Mark or Bob Mark. I don't know how to say it.
*  What were the most important things you learned this year? Has you,
*  have you changed your mind? Why?
*  I don't know if I would call them things I've learned. Uh,
*  I think I have a new favorite saying that I didn't have at the beginning of the
*  year and it's context is that which is scarce.
*  So please don't elaborate further.
*  If I go to events with people, which I do pretty often, you know,
*  even in COVID times, it used to be,
*  I would go to hear new and daring ideas that I hadn't heard before. And you know,
*  that's great. But I think especially with Twitter,
*  it's very hard to hear new and daring ideas you haven't heard before. So why you,
*  why are you listening to other people? They're the way they put things,
*  the way they argue, the way they paint the bigger picture,
*  you're getting a lot more context for ideas you're somewhat already familiar
*  with. And that context is important. Or by studying other cultures,
*  you're getting context for understanding people or situations or places.
*  And that at the margin is what I'm trying to get more of is more context rather
*  than new ideas. So, uh,
*  realizing that's more important than I thought, at least for me right now,
*  has been maybe my biggest mental change, but almost by definition,
*  it's not a new idea. It's like more context for context.
*  I,
*  I wonder if sometimes the reason why we don't attract more listeners to the show
*  is because there is a certain orientation that has to happen to appreciate
*  conversations with Tyler. Like if you sort of get what you're doing,
*  it's very easy. But I know from talking to people,
*  if you just pull up a random episode and listen to it,
*  I think a lot of people do not have that context.
*  Sure. It's deeply bizarre, right? Yeah.
*  And I think that's another good example. Context is that which is scarce.
*  So there's ways you can write where your readers have that context or ways you
*  can podcast where they do and then ways where they don't. Uh,
*  one thing with Twitter,
*  like Twitter itself pulls quotations out of context,
*  but they encourage people to read pieces that are removed from the context of a
*  blog or a particular magazine or newspaper.
*  And that's very much a mixed blessing.
*  So context arguably has become a lot more scarce with social media.
*  And that to me means there's high gains from being able to fill in those pieces.
*  But if this is a podcast that people need context for,
*  and I strongly suspect that it is, uh,
*  I think that's what we need more of. And if, you know, fewer people listen,
*  I'm not going to say great,
*  but I don't want to explain everything from scratch.
*  Like the first question I think ought to be jumping right in.
*  Right. Uh, our, uh, our, um,
*  one thing that we're actually thinking about on marketing is how we can,
*  how we can do that. So we're not asking you to do that,
*  but we might try to find a way to sort of give people that,
*  that guide to get into the show. Cause while I respect these sort of like,
*  if you don't like it, get out of your attitude,
*  we also think that this is a good product and we want more people to enjoy it.
*  Sure.
*  So we want to give people the tools to enjoy it.
*  So do like a 10 point guide to understanding conversations with Tyler.
*  Yes. And if anyone out there will never ask what the book is about,
*  he will never give you a chance to explain what you're about.
*  The first question will be very pointed in specific.
*  Yes. Uh, yes. If anyone out there wants to take a first stab at that,
*  I think a long time listeners will have no problem putting that together for the
*  benefit of new listeners. Um, last question for me, before we close,
*  related to this context thing, given that you're searching more for context,
*  how has your information diet changed? I mean,
*  are you spending less time in the past year?
*  How has your information diet changed in the past year?
*  Are you spending less time on the sort of streams of social media or trying to
*  change the composition there?
*  I don't think it's changed all that much.
*  I've spent a lot more time reading about the visual arts and studying images and
*  looking at the visual arts. That would be the biggest change.
*  That's maybe somewhat of a reversion to how I had been earlier rather than a
*  completely new thing. Uh, but that's what I would pick as what's been different.
*  And you, you wrote this book, uh,
*  one of your best books for this year was this guide to Sub-Saharan African
*  architecture and why include that?
*  What was it about that spoke to you?
*  Obviously Africa is a very important continent.
*  It's a very hard continent to learn a lot about. Hard to get there,
*  not always an easy experience. So many countries,
*  even apart from COVID issues. And here are these seven books,
*  which I'm not done reading yet by the way, but I will finish the whole series.
*  That just teach you the whole history of Africans building things.
*  And that to me is in many ways a more fundamental history than just reading
*  another political history of Africa,
*  where they all go through more or less the same events. Well,
*  apartheid fell and then the Biafran war in Nigeria and this and that.
*  And that's all very important, but at the end of the day,
*  if you're interested in Africa at all, that is not what is scarce.
*  There's something more nitty gritty, more contextual on the ground.
*  And these books make a very serious attempt to give you that.
*  And they have excellent photographs and they cover the entire African continent
*  and also give you a sense of diversity and lived experience,
*  but also institutionally, how did these things actually happen?
*  Where did the influences come from? What was the role of colonialism?
*  Why are Finnish architects like prominent in some parts of Africa and not others
*  and so on.
*  So I thought it's a pretty remarkable series and one of my topics for book of
*  the year.
*  So architecture visual art as an entry point into learning about new fields or
*  areas. Correct. All right. Before we go,
*  I want to extend thanks to everyone who works on the conversations with Tyler
*  team.
*  It's not just me and Dallas and Morgan and some of the other names you might
*  hear on the podcast from time to time. It's Kate Brown, Kate Delanois,
*  Mike Hopper, Sloan Sherman, Caroline Bear, Karen Plant, Christina B.
*  He, Haley Larson, Anna McVeigh, Ashley Schiller.
*  All of these people have contributed significant time to the show in the past
*  year. And so on behalf of Tyler and myself,
*  thank you to the CWT team.
*  We appreciate your efforts and we look forward to another year of conversations.
*  I'm very lucky to work with all of you.
*  Thank you all who work on CWT very much and for any listeners or readers out
*  there who support us, your support is very greatly appreciated.
