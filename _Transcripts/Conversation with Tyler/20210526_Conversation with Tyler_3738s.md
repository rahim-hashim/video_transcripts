Video Description: As a Canadian economist who once served as the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney has had many occasions to reflect on the importance of values. Whether it’s ingratiating himself as a public servant in a foreign country, managing a central bank, or addressing climate change, he’s seen the power of shared objectives and the importance of value alignment in addressing critical and complex problems. As the global economy attempts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Carney has published these lessons in a new book, Values: Building a Better World for All.

In this special bonus episode, Mark joined Tyler to discuss why he went into economics instead of marine biology, the temperamental differences between ice hockey goalies and central bankers, why it’s important that central bankers plan for failure, what he learned from his father’s work with indigenous Canadians, how growing up near Alberta’s tar sands made him understand the power of the market, the biggest misconception people have about Goldman Sachs, how he established trust as a public servant in a foreign country, his advice for public speaking, why he prefers to speak early during large meetings, the validity of liquidity trap theories, the changes he’d make to the federal reserve governance structure, the greatest challenge of running a central bank, potential regulatory strategies for central bank digital currencies, how decentralized finance (DeFi) should be regulated, how central banks should address potential risks caused by climate change, what went wrong with Canada’s response to COVID-19, why there seems to be little populism in Canada, the future of the Toronto Raptors, where to find the best food in Canada, the best Clash album, the causes of the UK productivity slowdown, the most surprising thing he learned while writing his new book, his predictions for the future global economy post- COVID, and more.

# Mark Carney on Central Banking and Shared Values  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [May 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBlkm8siHi8)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm chatting with Mark Carney.
*  Mark has a new book out, new and excellent.
*  It's called Values, Building a Better World for All.
*  Mark is best known for having run the Bank of Canada, having been head of the Bank of
*  England.
*  He has done much more than that, and he will do much more yet.
*  Mark, welcome.
*  Thanks for having me, Tyler.
*  It's a great pleasure.
*  I'd like to start with what I call the Mark Carney Production Function.
*  Now why didn't you become a marine biologist?
*  Wow, that's good research.
*  I'd partly grown up on the prairies, number one.
*  You know what?
*  It was only once I got to college that I started to give up that because I went to Harvard,
*  so at least I got to the coast by that point.
*  But I got hooked by economics and then followed through with that.
*  Something better came up.
*  So you thought that economics is more satisfying?
*  Well, I wanted to try to understand how the world works, and in many respects it's the
*  only discipline, at least from my vantage point, that gave me the prospect of doing
*  that, both on a micro level and on a macro level, although I slightly feel we're better
*  at micro than macro.
*  Now if I understand correctly, you were back up goalie on Harvard's ice hockey team, and
*  goalies deliberately try to put themselves in front of a moving hard piece of rubber
*  that can be going as fast as 100 miles an hour.
*  Are most goalies a little crazy?
*  Funnily enough, you could say that, although my position on it was always that you're the
*  one person on the ice that's facing outwards at danger.
*  So if you're a defenseman or a forward or something, you can get hit from behind, you
*  can get hit from the side.
*  Lots of bad things can happen to you, whereas you're a goalie, at least you're facing your
*  opponent all the time, or at least you should be.
*  In what way is it different temperamentally than being a central banker, if any?
*  Great question.
*  You cannot be as anticipatory as a central banker.
*  You're building up muscle, you're building up muscle memory, so that particularly at
*  the higher levels, that you realize what you've done after the fact you've done it.
*  So you move before you tell your body to move.
*  But as a central banker, obviously, what you need to do is anticipate where the economy
*  is going and react in advance.
*  If you meet someone who possibly is an eligible candidate to be a central banker, do you think
*  you can tell how good a central banker they will be, if you know them a bit?
*  If you know them a bit, yes.
*  I think particularly for the higher levels of central banking, where you're trying to
*  combine analytic rigor and synthesizing that into an ability to communicate, which is often
*  the toughest thing.
*  Now your book is about values.
*  What would be the non-obvious value you look for in other potential central bankers?
*  Humility.
*  Humility.
*  I think that would be the biggest one.
*  And it took me a while to build up that value in a full disclosure.
*  But it's incredibly important.
*  And if I may, I try to draw out why that value is relevant.
*  And one of the lessons, at least for me over the years as a central banker, as a policymaker,
*  you have to plan for failure.
*  So you have to think about, don't always tell yourself you've got things sorted and that
*  you can withstand the failure, plan for the failure, and think of what will I wish, what
*  would I wish I had done once that failure happens and think about whether you should
*  do it in advance.
*  Your father's job, he worked on the affairs of Native Canadians for some time.
*  What did you learn from him or from that experience of what he did?
*  I learned, and I see this more clearly now, I learned just how long the tail of
*  damage, how that passes through generations.
*  So it's not just the generation that is affected initially, but it can have a life and how
*  hard it is to break that cycle.
*  So it's almost a bit like macroeconomic persistence of unemployment, but squared or cubed or all
*  the more so.
*  It is like that.
*  It's also like, this is an imperfect analogy, but I enjoyed your conversation with Ben Friedman,
*  the other day, or a few months ago, I guess, and his point about living on values.
*  In his case, it was Presbyterian values.
*  Things can pass through both positively and negatively across generations, and so you
*  need bigger efforts in either to reinforce them or to turn them the other way.
*  Now, you grew up in Northwest Territories and also Alberta, so Western Canada.
*  How do you think that's shaped your perspective on economies?
*  Well, the big thing I took from my time in Alberta is just, I mean, it made me a market
*  believer because, I'll give you an example, I was born just north of what was then known
*  as the tar sands, now known as the oil sands, this huge deposit of oil, which was virtually
*  impossible to get out of the ground economically.
*  It was sitting there, literally, on the surface, but to separate it from the sand was difficult.
*  And then, very quickly, over the course of, as I was growing up, by the time I was an
*  adult, the issue had been cracked, and so the ability to innovate and make a profit
*  out of an opportunity.
*  Your PhD thesis was called the Dynamic Advantage of Competition.
*  Writing that thesis, what did you learn, not about the topic, but about yourself?
*  Hmm.
*  I learned that I exhausted my capacity and desire to do game theory.
*  It was a game, in the end, the models were game theoretic.
*  The explanations were rooted in case studies and some econometrics, but the models were
*  formalized from a game theory perspective.
*  I also learned that I wanted to do policy at some point as well.
*  What's the biggest misconception people have about Goldman Sachs?
*  That it's everyone out for themselves.
*  And how is it?
*  When I was there, and I was there for 13 years in total, one of the biggest lessons I took
*  from that place was teamwork.
*  And I'll give you an example.
*  No matter who you were, if you needed to get a hold of somebody in the organization, they
*  would be back to you, certainly within 24 hours.
*  They might be on the other side of the world.
*  And that went from the CEO.
*  When I was at the most junior level, I needed to speak to the CEO, Bob Rubin.
*  And he didn't know me, but he got back to me because I wouldn't have left him a message
*  if it wasn't important.
*  And that's a lesson I've carried through.
*  Now, it seems to me that a lot of people trust you.
*  Even British people trust you, right?
*  They trusted you with their central bank.
*  So that's a skill.
*  What else is it that you did to learn that skill?
*  Obviously you decided to be trustworthy.
*  But what else is in there?
*  I think part of it is admitting when things go wrong, or when you've learned new information
*  and you've changed your view, which is difficult to do.
*  Maybe that's another aspect of humility.
*  Part of it is competence.
*  I think it's hard to fully be trusted unless you're successful.
*  You make more right decisions than not.
*  And then we can debate how much of that is the product of luck in the end.
*  But a combination of those things.
*  Last thing, to be trusted, you need to feel someone's on your side, that you're aligned.
*  You're aligned with the people you're serving.
*  And as a public servant, as a central banker, you should be able to accomplish that.
*  But it's important to establish that.
*  If someone comes up to you younger and they say, I would like to learn how to give good
*  speeches, how did you learn how to give good speeches?
*  What do you study?
*  Which speakers?
*  Do you go to YouTube?
*  What do you do?
*  I should have.
*  Well, I didn't have YouTube when I was, or it wasn't widely available when I was learning
*  how to give speeches.
*  One thing I would say is that you need to go over them multiple times.
*  You need to give the speech in order to understand how, practice giving the speech.
*  And then that reveals things that you can pull in or that which won't be sentences,
*  which are too complicated, that which won't be well understood.
*  Have stories, have things that illustrate your deeper point.
*  I as a central banker, and maybe this is you're asking a general question, but as a central
*  banker, put the substance as much as possible into footnotes.
*  So you're well grounded in terms of your argument, but it's not cluttering the argument and losing
*  your audience.
*  I think the last point I'd make, and hopefully this isn't the case on this conversation,
*  but if you lose your audience, you've lost it.
*  You don't get them back while you're giving the speech.
*  And so it's crucial to keep the pacing and the insights spread so that you're retaining
*  your audience.
*  And who is a speaker has influenced you?
*  I think that, I think Brown, Gordon Brown, who I had occasion to see on a number of,
*  through the G7, G20 when I was a deputy governor in terms of policymakers, he has, he is a
*  technocrat that was a politician and he had an ability to turn on his political voice
*  and inspire in a way that both told you that he knew what he was talking about, but really
*  helped to inspire you.
*  If you're speaking in a meeting as the central banker present, do you prefer to speak first
*  or speak last?
*  I prefer, I tend to speak early.
*  Yes, I tend to speak early.
*  I'm not sure that's always the best strategy, but I tend to speak early.
*  I will say one thing, Tyler, that's happened over the years at places like the G20 I noticed
*  is the prevalence of social media and devices.
*  The audience drifts away over time, even at the G20 and even on a discussion of the global
*  economy.
*  Maybe especially on a discussion.
*  Well, maybe especially a discussion of global economy.
*  And I mentioned it in the book that it was the discussion in Riyadh in February on COVID,
*  which was one time that you saw everyone's heads snap up from their iPads in there and
*  pay attention because it was the moment the pin dropped for the vast majority that we
*  were in big trouble.
*  Let's move to the thrilling central banking topic of the liquidity trap.
*  So what I observe in my own country is that for over a decade, we have rates of price
*  inflation really very close to 1.8 percent, right?
*  Close to 2 percent.
*  The liquidity trap in its essence claims the central bank can't control the price level.
*  Maybe the price level is indeterminate.
*  My view is simply the liquidity trap theories are wrong.
*  What's your view?
*  My view has been that there is a liquidity trap or there can be a liquidity trap.
*  So I guess I wouldn't fully subscribe that there can't be.
*  Well, there wasn't.
*  I would say there wasn't.
*  But there wasn't.
*  I think you're absolutely right on that.
*  There wasn't.
*  I mean, it is revealed that there wasn't a liquidity trap.
*  for a large portion of that period, it was not that fiscal policy was providing the support.
*  So it wasn't the substitute for monetary policy.
*  And I think the innovation that was done on the monetary policy side helped ensure that
*  the Fed didn't quite get to its dual mandate, but it got pretty close.
*  And in the end, actually, by 2019, it certainly was there, in my judgment, at its dual mandate.
*  So that showed the ability to innovate in terms of policy tools and provide that at
*  the cost of some other risk that built up, of course.
*  And what's the model you use for thinking about why the liquidity trap may not have
*  applied?
*  Because as you well know, interest was being paid on reserves.
*  It wasn't identically equal to the T-bill rate, but it was very close.
*  T-bill markets are extremely liquid.
*  Why are bank reserves and T-bills sufficiently different assets to give monetary policy
*  traction?
*  Well, the bank reserves, of course, bank reserves exist for settlement between banks.
*  And so bank reserves are not assets for, sorry, are not liabilities that the bank can actually,
*  the commercial bank can actually act on and lend out.
*  Of course, with quantitative easing, banks were in effect forced to carry these reserves,
*  blessed with these extra reserves in order for the central bank, the Fed in this instance,
*  to buy bonds.
*  And the reason the liquidity trap has not existed, particularly in the United States,
*  the UK as well, but has been because financial conditions have been easier than they otherwise
*  would be because of asset purchases and other measures that have been put in place.
*  Now what I would argue, sorry, Tyler, is that there comes a point even with those where,
*  for example, I would say that Japan, very close in fact in a liquidity trap, has been
*  in a liquidity trap.
*  As you know, right now we Americans are all debating as to whether the measured higher
*  rate of price inflation will simply be transitory.
*  Other than market prices, which is obvious, what are the indicators we should be looking
*  at more closely that are perhaps a little underrated?
*  Underrated?
*  Well, I think the first thing, let me tell you what I would go to first is I would look
*  to the labor market, adjust for compositional effects.
*  In other words, is to what extent is wage inflation being driven by more high wage jobs
*  being created than lower wage jobs?
*  broad suite of labor market indicators, including participation rates, hourly earnings, cut
*  across various different segments.
*  I think what is developing though is it's becoming obvious that input costs are moving
*  more rapidly than one would have expected, at least I would have expected.
*  And part of that is a product of supply bottlenecks as well.
*  So that tells us something about potentially supply capacity in the economy.
*  And if I go back to what I just said on the labor market, because I didn't quite finish
*  the thought, is that something I shouldn't do in a speech, by the way, but I didn't quite
*  finish the thought, which is that one would expect that the natural rate of unemployment
*  has gone up as a consequence of relatively large proportion of the population being out
*  of work, effectively out of work.
*  And so one's looking for the risk here is that as the economy gets back to the level
*  it was before, the supply in the economy is not going to get back to the level it was
*  before, at least not quickly.
*  And so those price pressures will come through more quickly.
*  And we're seeing some early indicators, we're seeing some indicators, I would say, that's
*  consistent with that.
*  Let's say we put you in charge of our central bank, the Fed.
*  How would you change governance, not monetary policy, not regulation, but the actual structure
*  of the Federal Reserve system?
*  Oh, that is a really tricky one.
*  I don't think that, I mean, there's path dependence in all regulatory frameworks in central banks.
*  The governance, the rotating regional Fed share, I understand why the regional Fed exists,
*  but the rotating chair system, I probably would not have that.
*  I would have a clearer obligation on the Federal Reserve to identify and use its tools to address
*  financial stability risks.
*  Ultimately, that's housed in something called the FSOC, as you know, chaired by the Treasury
*  Secretary, but I would have the Fed more on the hook, I think they'd be happy with this,
*  for identifying what can go wrong and what should be done about it.
*  I'm not saying add powers to them in order for that to be the case.
*  And I would, what we would like to see, look, I thought the system in, I'm a prisoner of
*  my past, but the system in the UK where there was quite a rigorous independence of the committee
*  members on what's called the Monetary Policy Committee, the equivalent of the FOMC, and
*  they felt individual responsibility.
*  So they definitely would vote in different ways than the governor.
*  They didn't feel a need to have a consensus that was consistent with what the governor
*  thought, because they were individually on the hook for their votes and you knew how
*  people had voted.
*  And that led to quite robust discussions in a healthy way about the outlook for the economy.
*  So the Fed has elements of that, but it also, and sorry, I'll finish on this topic, which
*  is it has a tradition or a convention that is more consensus based than we had in the UK.
*  Taking central banks just as autonomous institutions, putting aside monetary policy, putting aside
*  regulation, just running them.
*  What's the greatest challenge?
*  Greatest challenge, they're very hierarchical institutions, historically have been, and
*  the older they are, the more hierarchical they are.
*  So the greatest challenge is to, well, you have a formal structure for who makes the
*  decision, whether the committee or the individual.
*  The greatest challenge is to empower people below to say what they think and to be clear
*  and to act as if they are making the decision.
*  So they give clear advice as opposed to classic on the one hand, on the other hand type advice.
*  And we tried various ways to make that happen at the Bank of England, I think with some
*  success.
*  I'm sure they're doing it much better after I left.
*  Should boards of governors of central banks in essence have COOs so they don't have to
*  actually run the central bank?
*  Absolutely.
*  And we did have at the Bank of England.
*  How should central bankers treat off balance sheet risk differently, if at all?
*  Off balance sheet risk of a private financial institution, you mean?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  They should, they should, and we started to take steps in this way, something called step
*  in risk.
*  The assumption is that the off balance sheet risk, there will be either a moral or some
*  other quasi legal responsibility for the connected institution to assume those risks.
*  So you should always assume that those risks collapse back on the central balance sheet,
*  just as if you recall the SIBs in 2008 collapsed back on the balance sheets at major institutions
*  like Citibank, for example, and Merrill Lynch and all of a sudden balance sheets that looked
*  relatively healthy looked awful because they have substantially higher risk assets.
*  And of course, the assets that were off balance sheet were off balance sheet because they
*  weren't that high quality.
*  Now this yourself, there's Stanley Fisher.
*  As you know, there's a trend of recruiting central bankers from other countries.
*  So far, it seems it's worked quite well.
*  But what are the limits of this process of recruiting leaders in government from abroad?
*  So you wouldn't name someone to run the Department of Defense who is from another country, right?
*  What's the margin where that doesn't work anymore?
*  Well I think, candidly, I think it was a relatively unique set of circumstances when I was put
*  in place.
*  I mean, the UK had had a very bad financial crisis.
*  We had a new central bank.
*  In other words, the powers had been tripled, had been doubled in size, and there's an opportunity
*  to bring an outsider in in order to help try to make that work.
*  I don't know, I'm a little hard pressed to see the set of circumstances where it would
*  be immediately obvious to bring an outsider back in again.
*  My answer is there have been examples.
*  The governor of the Bank of Ireland, for example, is a third example, Gabriel McClough at present.
*  But it's very much the exception as opposed to the rule.
*  And it relies heavily on the technocratic nature of the role.
*  Are there classes of decisions where such a head should recuse himself or herself or
*  would just feel hesitant?
*  Very risky decisions or extending foreign lines of credit, which the Fed has done a
*  lot, or exchange rate policy?
*  No, I think if you take these roles, you have to be able to take every decision no matter
*  how small or how large.
*  I never felt any circumstance where either I didn't have adequate information or, God
*  forbid, that I was somehow conflicted in my loyalties, that it would have influenced a decision.
*  OK, topic of the day is central bank digital currencies, as you know, right?
*  Jay Powell spoke about that just the other day.
*  If we move to some form of a central bank digital currency, how do we avoid or limit
*  disintermediation as people pull their assets out of commercial banks and go directly through
*  the central bank?
*  Well, there's a couple of ways.
*  And I think the way that the most likely route that this is, and I'll come to an issue with
*  it, is that there are two tiers to the central bank digital currency.
*  So the digital currency is as much a wholesale or it's principally a wholesale digital currency.
*  What faces you and I in those listening is some form of wallet.
*  We have a relationship with whether it's a commercial bank or an emerging tech company
*  or a fintech company that is through the wallet.
*  And that's how we access currency.
*  Now, as you know, but it bears repeating, most of that currency, most of that money
*  will have been created by the private financial system itself.
*  Very little of it actually is the digital currency.
*  And one of the decision points is whether we as citizens have a right to access the
*  ultimate safe asset or at least a portion of our earnings in the ultimate safe asset.
*  In one model, the safest model, the one that doesn't avoid the question, it solves the
*  question that you put very rightly put on the table.
*  The digital currency is only at the wholesale level.
*  So it's the top tier between institutions, not at the customer facing the retail facing
*  level.
*  That's it.
*  There's the Leone Miller theorem, right?
*  So maybe I, Tyler Cowen, can't legally access the digital currency, but an intermediary
*  will give me an equivalent service, if only through crypto, right?
*  So there can be a private layer that in essence gives me that access.
*  There will be a private layer.
*  OK, so the extreme version of that is a private stable coins, which a form of crypto, which
*  is backed with the could be the digital central bank digital currency or or or treasury bills
*  and some other safe assets that mimic it.
*  That is that's possible.
*  It's it it doesn't in and of itself, since it's a private layer, isn't of itself fully
*  resilient.
*  And I use the example in the in the book of effectively the Bank of Amsterdam, which lasted
*  almost a century.
*  Well, more than a century was a form of stable coin.
*  They're offering the bank bills supposedly fully backed by the gold that people had deposited.
*  Now over time, they gradually ran a mismatch.
*  And that's that's the danger with that structure.
*  If that becomes the core structure.
*  Tyler, what I didn't sorry, I didn't quite finish my point earlier.
*  I gave you one one model, which is keeps the central bank digital currency at the top layer
*  of the wholesale.
*  I think there is a very legitimate argument of citizens and others to say, well, actually
*  today I can I can carry around cash.
*  I have access to the ultimate safe asset.
*  And if and if we're only going to be in a digital world, I should have a right to that
*  safe asset as well.
*  And I think at this stage is at least for my limits of my imagination, the only way
*  I can see directly around your issue is to limit the portion of my assets that I can
*  hold in cash.
*  Sorry, central bank digital currency in this example, because otherwise that instantaneous
*  run risk very much does exist.
*  And it it it it you collapse the private money into public money in times of stress.
*  So it's it is a real issue.
*  If it's wholesale only the digital currency, or if my participation is limited, those are
*  like limits on capital flows.
*  So will the digital currency sell at a different price than say the dollar, the euro, the
*  other regular?
*  It should not, because money will be indistinguishable between the private money that's created,
*  just as it is today between central bank reserves and and cash.
*  But they do different things.
*  They do different things.
*  There's a kind of capital flow restriction on funds in and out from one to the other.
*  It would seem you'd end up with separation of the unit of account and you'd have two
*  media of exchange two currencies.
*  I don't mind this scenario.
*  No, but we don't want to have well we don't have separation.
*  Exactly.
*  In the wholesale example, I can't reach up to that level.
*  I can't is that now you can say in the wholesale market, then you could and in in stress, there
*  would be a premium for that, which I suppose is a possibility in the in the hybrid model.
*  So there's some some retail and some the bulk of it is private.
*  There is a the the I don't envision I'm sorry, I guess I left out important point I don't
*  envision the central bank digital currency paying a return.
*  So I'm not one who says let's have a central bank digital currency so we can have wildly
*  negative interest rates so we can add another tool to the toolbox.
*  And so that exchange ratio, my term, but I think it's the same concept ends up showing
*  up in what the deposit rate is at the financial institution as it does today.
*  How should we regulate decentralized finance defy as they call it?
*  Another great question.
*  I think the first thing is that is recognizing that that is a real possibility that we will
*  have a world which is a combination of centralized and decentralized finance, that there is potential
*  value and I hedge it a bit because I can see the potential but I haven't really seen it
*  at scale being applied in so called native currencies that exist and facilitate decentralized
*  finance and the smart contracts that are part of that.
*  I think we have to regulate the couple obvious things we have to do in terms of regulation
*  going in and out of decentralized finance which is classic know your customer any money
*  laundering counter terrorist financing those sort of boundaries between the two the the
*  the resilience of the institutions that operate within decentralized finance.
*  Thirdly, the nature of the crypto asset or that that's used as the quote native currency
*  and its resilience.
*  So its supply algorithm, whether or not it's backed, whether or not it is itself a stable
*  coin and if it is a stable coin who oversees the nature of that stable coin.
*  There are some that had represented as you probably know I'm sure that they were fully
*  backed by cash and it turns out that they're very much not.
*  So there's a there's a conduct any money laundering know your customer element going in and out
*  of DeFi and then there's resilience of the DeFi segment itself.
*  As you know there are truly anonymous forms of crypto whether we like it or not.
*  How many degrees of freedom do we really have in regulating non anonymous crypto given that
*  people have the option of switching into anonymous crypto?
*  We can only regulate them as it comes into the formal financial system and but we certainly
*  can regulate anybody who is in the formal financial system and their how they dock into
*  that system.
*  So a crypto exchange I've long been saying that crypto exchanges should be regulated as
*  other exchanges are and should be subject to the same quality standards and know your customer
*  standards and others and I think the best crypto exchanges absolutely agree with that.
*  Private financial institutions and their interactions between you know ultimately it is interesting
*  how essential much of crypto that crypto for a decentralized system ultimately needs to
*  come back into the centralized system in order to be a media a true medium of exchange.
*  So those who have been taking ransomware in crypto likely will ultimately come back into
*  the formal financial system at some point and that's where the regulation has to catch.
*  If I look at IPCC estimates of the costs of climate change I see talk of a base case of
*  maybe five to six percent of global GDP possible risks of up to twenty or maybe thirty percent
*  of GDP all this you discuss in your book of course but given that wide range of estimates
*  which perhaps will get wider yet what can central banks usefully do with this information
*  given that they're not really special adjudicators of wisdom about climate change.
*  That's right and that's right we're not special adjudicators of wisdom about climate change.
*  There's a couple of things we can do and of course you know there's a difference between
*  the flow estimate the GDP estimates and I'd center it and I do in the book more around
*  twenty five percent of GDP and that's a level effect farther out but and we can debate that
*  but also there's the asset price effect and this is a critical element and you know whether it's
*  commercial real estate or value of fossil fuel assets or other investments and or loans that
*  banks themselves and investment pools have. So what can central banks do? First thing is to take
*  a look at the the risk profile associated with climate change. Most of the risk in the course of
*  let's say the next decade fifteen years relates to what's called transition risk. It's yes there is
*  risk for certain activities because of increase of extreme weather events and the knock-on effects
*  of that that's absolutely there but most of the risk and I'll give you an example if you're lending
*  or investing in the European auto industry now you probably want to take into account that you
*  can't sell an internal combustion engine vehicle in Europe after 2030. That is a regulation that is
*  transition risk. The question that central banks can do with financial institutions is working
*  through with them the extent to which they've assessed those financial institutions have
*  assessed these types of risks and then those private financial institutions make the judgments
*  about which ones are worth bearing and just to be clear some of the biggest risks in the system
*  are that if I can put it this way we do what we say in other words whether it's through private
*  innovation public regulation some combination of the two that we move to an economy that is lower
*  carbon and more consistent with the overall objective of 130 countries which is one and a
*  But 25% of global GDP seems very very high to me so as central bankers we look at market prices
*  right most insurance companies are not insolvent that's a forward-looking market price coastal
*  property the prices of some of it are down but not radically so Obama bought a house at Martha's
*  Vineyard no one said that was a huge mistake if the if the actual cost are five six percent of
*  GDP maybe that's a year and a half's global growth which is still highly significant but a lot of it
*  happened slowly it's predicted it's signaled by market prices in advance if the central bank just
*  went about doing its old ordinary business and did a good job I mean what exactly is going to go wrong
*  that makes it necessary to extend their mandate to climate change a couple couple things three
*  things and you added a third at the end first is having been a regulator of the insurance industry
*  I can tell you and particularly the property and casualty in the reinsurance industry they think
*  this is a big risk in fact if you if you're the regulator if you were the regulator of Lloyd's of
*  London one of the biggest reinsurers in the world it's number one number two in terms of their risk
*  and the reason why Lloyd's is doing you know does well it has some good years that you know some
*  years better than others and these big P&C companies is because they write relatively short-term
*  contracts and they reprice so they reprice coverage and they reprice risk and so they're
*  following the impact of climate change on the physical risks and they're able to react to it
*  because they're not writing a whole ton of 30-year cat risk catastrophe risk in their books they
*  write some but they don't write that's not at the core so that's the first point second point is
*  that and and it goes to your last point which is that some central banks have this responsibility
*  because of whom they oversee not some central banks Bank of Canada for example it's it's a
*  monetary institute for lack of a better word its job is price stability largely it does a bit of
*  analysis on the financial stability side a bit on payments but it's largely price stability
*  but if you oversee major financial institutions and there is large risk perspective risk clearly
*  in insurance potentially in banking because of the transition risk i was talking about a moment ago
*  and you know just give an example this week the week we're talking the IEA has come out with their
*  forecast for or their scenarios i should say for what's necessary in order to achieve one and a
*  half degrees the orders of magnitude of stranded assets of known reserves in energy are three
*  quarters of coal proven reserves half of gas and and and more than a third of oil and so you have
*  to think about as a central bank well or not as a as a bank or as an investor well am i exposed
*  to the bit that gets produced or the bit that won't get produced if we're in this scenario or
*  do i think we won't end up in this scenario and it all get produced and the real risk will be
*  on the physical side so just to wrap up some central banks have that direct responsibility
*  Bank of England absolutely clearly did is the insurance regulator but also the financial
*  stability the macro prudential regulator others don't because they only do monetary policy and
*  many are in somewhere in between but i would say i said that was going to be the last point
*  i'll make one other that we have 90 central banks from around the world that cover 85% of global gdp
*  which is part of the central bank group self-selected into that group that is looking
*  at these risks and and how to make sure the system is resilient because the loop back to something
*  else we were talking about earlier we need to plan for failure we need to make sure the system
*  is resilient for these type of risks so that the financial system is not part of the problem and
*  it can help support things going forward given that climate change is such a highly politicized
*  topic do we endanger the independence of central banks by giving them a climate change mandate
*  well it okay so it depends that presumes that the men there is a new mandate and the nature in which
*  it's given so what has happened in the uk is that the chancellor and this is the way the system
*  works in the uk is for the monetary policy committee the financial stability committee and
*  then the regulatory committee the one that oversees just the micro prudential health of banks and
*  insurers the government has clearly said your responsibility includes taking into account
*  climate change risk each of those committees that is a that is a direction that is democratic
*  accountability is consistent with the law it's consistent with the set of risks the the law that
*  governs the central bank but it is not the central bank reading into its mandate a new responsibility
*  it is there's a difference between given something or or directed to do something again consistent
*  with the legal framework and and having the central bank appropriate that responsibility which
*  is not the case in the uk now as we are talking in mid-may can it is doing a wonderful job
*  catching up with vaccinating canadians and that's great but if we think of the very slow initial
*  procurement and the pretty slow initial rollout is that telling us something about problems with
*  state capacity in canada which we typically think of as a very well governed nation but is there
*  anything we're learning there i absolutely uh i think you put it well it it three things three
*  things one is i think there's a problem with state capacity in advance um so we had inadequate
*  vaccine production capacity we didn't have any uh this is the bottom line we had inadequate
*  supplies of ppe and arguably inadequate capacity in our health care system and as you well know the
*  the less capacity even your health care system the riskier it gets even small increases in
*  in infections uh so all of that was in advance secondly in terms of uh the the track and trace
*  system put in place in canada is not really operable i mean it's there in theory but it
*  it is not an effective part of the of the pandemic response and then thirdly uh the vaccine rollout
*  has been slow it's been slow relative to the u.s and uh the uk now it is now it is catching up
*  it's very much catching up but why did those go wrong what's the general problem or reconsideration
*  about canadian government i think a lot of people think you're better governed than a lot of places
*  right well we are better governed we are governed a lot of places um i think that in the case of
*  systemic risk we're talking about another systemic risk around pandemics uh that there was not the
*  there is an absence of clear responsibility who's responsible for it and empowering those who's
*  responsible still uh there's a lot of finger pointing between the federal governments and
*  the provincial governments so some of it is a question of responsibility across jurisdictions
*  as opposed to taking full ownership of the issue and saying that we are jointly responsible for
*  canadians a canadian's health in the middle of a pandemic and we will jointly work together
*  uh and share the the positives and the negatives of the outcomes for canadians because after all i
*  mean i'm talking to you from ottawa i don't view myself as ottawa and ontario and i view myself as
*  a canadian uh first and foremost and i expect my governments to deliver for me why is ottawa such
*  a nice and interesting city and yet so cheap serious question it's cold in the winter uh that's
*  and it is called right well it's not as cold this is the second coldest capital in the world after
*  ulan bataour so uh it's um it's not as cheap as it used to be but it is certainly value for money
*  yes uh i i don't know the good i don't have a good answer for that why is there so little populism
*  in canada you have plenty of immigrants right arguably in ontario you've had some local populism
*  but nationally it doesn't seem to have taken off well i think uh it's good observation uh it's
*  partly you know populism the way i think of it is it moves into an us versus them um you know the
*  people versus the elite uh type approach and so part of what determines populism uh in my my way
*  of thinking is how how much do people believe that there is a quality of opportunity or an ability
*  to move through the system how much do people believe that there is equal access and so a couple
*  of things that underscore that in canada universal health care uh virtually everybody sends their kids
*  to the state uh education system so you have universal on that and one of the things which
*  has slowed our response and actually on the pandemic is an application of that universality
*  for example for vaccines and and and universality for lockdowns and other requirements in a way that
*  meets equality but does is not as effective as it could be on a risk management basis give you an
*  example it would make more sense to go and vaccinate the teachers and vaccinate those who are
*  working in meatpacking plants and amazon warehouse and other hot spots for the disease but that's
*  not the approach the approach has been very rigorously uh equal uh working down through
*  age cohorts and you know i think that that has its downsides but it has it reinforces um
*  we're all in this together uh and therefore um ways against the populism possibilities
*  are the toronto rafters doomed to be on average a subpar nba team due to higher taxes
*  well they i mean they are policy question right fiscal fantastic question no uh short answer
*  wildly popular and they're able to gross up uh second um you know from a basketball competitiveness
*  uh perspective we're pleased to see the biden uh tax proposals and the u.s coming in this direction
*  and uh i think the you know the track record uh does indicate that um you know an nba championship
*  and getting close uh you know last time is uh so far so good where's the best food in canada
*  for me vancouver um is or a nouvelle or what uh everything uh because of because of the range
*  a fantastic indian uh nouvelle uh absolutely amazing um japanese is a kaya type uh and i you
*  know and part of it is uh my my my parents are originally from that area not vancouver itself and
*  so i have nice associations with it what's your favorite movie and why
*  uh my favorite movie was um gallipoli um oddly uh which is an australian movie peter weir uh it's
*  about first world war uh and the dardanelles um attack on the dardanelles and it's uh i i just
*  thought it was a it was a brilliant film and the sense of foreboding that comes with it and uh
*  beautifully shot and i don't know it's always stuck with me and to refer back to the theme
*  of your book how does that stem from your values uh there is okay i there's a couple of things in
*  that one is the the main characters uh who are actually one of them is mel gibson they there is
*  they have to basically they basically have to sacrifice themselves for the for the group uh and
*  and so that sense of solidarity that is is part and parcel of uh of of that and a big component of
*  the book what's your favorite o henry story the match i why uh because it has uh which i use
*  for the purposes of for two reasons one i liked it as a child uh the irony of the you know delia
*  cuts her hair and uh in order to buy jim a watch shane and jim sells his watch in order to give her
*  hair comb and so i like the irony of it i did like henry a lot actually as a kid and then i
*  you know stumbling across this uh joel wadfogle uh article and um him saying that you know this is
*  well actually wasn't he didn't use that as an example i'm using it as a counter example
*  to him but uh uh the aer's uh his paper in the aer which is about the deadweight loss of gift
*  giving at christmas because i can't perfectly even with all these questions you won't be able
*  to perfectly anticipate what i want next year for christmas and the story is about the primacy of
*  values right absolutely yeah and that was you know they didn't have and the fact that they were
*  willing to sacrifice that which was most dear in order for their beloved to get a present at
*  christmas uh you know demonstrated uh you know their love for each other more than hanging on
*  to uh that which they cared most about alice monroe or margaret atwood uh margaret atwood uh
*  redmore what's the best clash album ah fantastic question uh london london calling uh and one of my
*  best memories uh i was very fortunate they came to edmonton when i was in when i was in 12th grade
*  in high school and i got i went to the concert and that was fantastic yeah i also saw them i think
*  in what would have been 12th grade had i been in school that year but london calling is too
*  commercial for me i much prefer the green album like career opportunities yeah janie jones uh
*  well i fought the law was the best song um at the concert uh and i have to say they they had got to
*  combat rock by this time which was i you know relative relative combat rock was more commercial
*  i thought than london calling although they threw it all out out the door with santa nista
*  uh why was there such a big productivity slowdown in the united kingdom if indeed you accept that
*  premise uh the productivity slowdown you mean in the last decade uh more than a decade but again
*  people dispute exactly the nature of the facts here so okay well i think you know there's a few
*  factors i i do think broad brush uh and i'll give you uh four explanations uh first is uh big a
*  bigger aftermath of the financial crisis than in many uh jurisdictions so just access to capital
*  and the starving of investment that came from that um relatedly from a statistical perspective
*  quite a lot of the productivity as much as a third of the productivity uh in the run-up to the crisis
*  came from financial services at least as productivity was measured and basically lending
*  the lending spread i'm simplifying counted as productivity so if you were in a credit room
*  you were getting productivity so that's one aspect second aspect uh is a managerial explanation
*  that my colleague andy helday did a lot of work on and uh and is written extensively on which is
*  that there's a longer tail of uh if you look at productivity on a firm basis the tails have have
*  lengthened and fattened so there's less of a diffusion of productivity and obviously economies
*  of scope and scale that are also concentrated in those larger firms uh and then the third thing and
*  this will be you know there's different views on this i think the numbers are pretty clear uh is
*  from 2016 to 2020 uh you know from the brexit referendum until brexit a period of pretty
*  intense uncertainty and basically a flat lining of investment over that period and you know it's
*  hard to grow productivity as fast if you're not investing now you've been a well-known critic of
*  brexit and i was myself pro remain but when you watch the handling of the pandemic especially the
*  vaccines the eu doing such a bad job on procurement do you have second thoughts and think as i do
*  maybe brexit wasn't so terrible after all well uh two things uh one my job uh was again was to plan
*  for a difficult outcome and so we had to make sure that the financial system was ready in case there
*  was a no-deal brexit or a very disruptive brexit in the end we didn't have that uh but we put the
*  financial system in a position so they could withstand that a lot of what we said and did
*  you know was interpreted as my one of my colleagues said we've been called at the bank of england
*  merchants of doom uh which he took as a compliment uh because our job was to plan for that failure so
*  that's that's the uh that's the first thing and so we put the system in a stronger position
*  so that it could the financial system at least could be part of the solution as we came out
*  in terms of uh in terms of the pandemic uh i i think it is clear that the uk it's had its issues
*  we've all had our issues but has handled it better than the eu and that um elements of the eu's
*  approach have been actively counterproductive so in this in that respect yes it has been better
*  and as you know the british pound has bounced back entirely right there was a plunge right after the
*  referendum which was truly a surprise to the markets but now the pound is back doesn't that
*  mean in essence there weren't really macro costs to brexit it just looked that way for a short while
*  well i'm not sure i think it's uh i wouldn't say that the if you look at broader asset prices
*  uh i mean there has been some recovery in uk equities and other assets but it's uh
*  uh it it i i would be hard pressed to say that they followed the trajectory if there hadn't
*  that they would have if this hadn't happened that's not to say that uh you know these these
*  are all relative and so it matters what the uk does with brexit and uh you know stock of new
*  trade deals and uh and using more and more of this flexibility that they've gained from uh from a
*  consequence and so that that can lead to growth as well if scotland and i and northern ireland
*  were to leave the united kingdom would that make being the central banker of england alone harder
*  or easier uh it would make it um it's not a desirable outcome no i agree it's bad but
*  it doesn't look to me like an optimal currency area with the rest of the uk scotland does
*  scotland is uh yes scotland is more of an optimal currency area and certainly it i i think the
*  challenges uh which were a little underestimated by some of scotland leaving the uk um and losing
*  the fiscal uh stabilizer that came naturally uh as being part of the united kingdom uh that was
*  underestimated would it make it easier on the margin would it make it easier uh yeah i i look
*  the honest answer is and since this is marginal revolution yes on the margin it would be easier
*  yes because it would but it would be harder for it would be harder for for scotland um the mix i
*  think and to be clear neither of us favors scotland leaving but if they did leave should
*  they choose the british pound the euro or a new currency of their own i think the logic of uh
*  the governing party in scotland uh is that they would likely they're little hedged on this but
*  part of the purpose of leaving there are other motivations but part of the economic purpose
*  would be to be part of the european union and if they were part of the european union they would
*  have to be at least agreed to be on a path to choosing the euro and uh there's a challenge of
*  retaining the pound um and and losing the uh losing the the integration of the financial system is
*  one of the financial risks there so the question is would they would they have a time path so that
*  they could move directly from sterling to euro it's a big it's a big big issue i don't pretend
*  to have the answer but i would think it would be more likely to choose the euro and certainly
*  for northern ireland if it were to leave and this is we are deeply into speculation here um well uh
*  it's almost certain it would be the euro and would scotland have a problem of oversized banks
*  relative to gdp of an independent scotland and what should they do about that uh the it is
*  possible to redomicile those banks one of the challenges uh and the short answer is it's it's
*  an addressable issue with sufficient time to address it and one of the challenges with the
*  last referendum is the timetable uh for withdrawal was on the order of magnitude of 18 months and
*  that was not sufficient time to do it what should switzerland do about having had banks
*  that are quite large relative to gdp and they're not in the eu in the typical way as you know
*  no i think well what switzerland has done is a couple of things one it's made those banks less
*  likely to fail by having running higher capital requirements and higher liquidity than even the
*  new standards secondly uh been pretty rigorous and one of my responsibilities bank of england was
*  working with them because they had big uk operations in terms of putting in place what
*  are called living wills so an ability to unwind aspects of those banks if uh if they hit the rocks
*  separate out the domestic banking assets of those banks so that retail banking continues on
*  and the hit is seen largely in the wholesale side as an irish citizen what should the irish
*  government have done in 2008 so irish austerity is much criticized but it does seem they ran out
*  of money right what could they have done better uh they ran out of money uh what could they have
*  done better i i mean i think broadly they handled it in a terrible situation well we worked closely
*  with funnily enough well not funny but uh canada and ireland are in the same constituency in the
*  imf and we work closely with them uh during the crisis including with determining how and when to
*  support um their financial institutions and how that support ranked in terms of the overall it
*  sounds like an esoteric point but it's an important point in terms of the overall debts of the country
*  that in other words that support was junior as opposed to perry pasu and i think that was
*  that that would contribute to their recovery now as you know mario droggy who was a central banker
*  he's now running italy for at least some while and he's put forward a plan to have a very aggressive
*  fiscal policy spending about 200 billion dollars euros whatever from my great distance it seems
*  to me italy's problem is not mainly one of demand it's been running on for 25 years it's a real
*  problem often resulting from local or even municipal rigidities and if that's the case
*  why would spending 200 billion when debt levels are quite high already why would that help what
*  do you think yeah uh first thing uh obviously i can't speak for uh prime minister droggy um but
*  i get used to saying that um but uh i i would think that he would agree with uh much of your premise
*  and i'll make following observations first thing italy it's the level of gdp is the same as it was
*  in 1999 it's an absolutely astonishing figure uh you know we've had a covet shock and everything
*  but there was just so and whereas germany is 25 27 above today even before they get the
*  covet recovery uh so and that is fundamentally your point uh it's a question of supply capacity
*  you know ultimately productivity uh given a weak population growth so what where productivity has
*  not gone in italy so that and and part of that is absolutely the regulatory aspects one famous
*  example very important example is around bankruptcy laws in italy and it just takes a very long time to
*  unwind a business and and and prosecute bankruptcy and of course well you don't want to lend if it
*  takes a long time to do that or start a business if it does and so there's a series of those types
*  of reforms that are necessary that said the most of that 200 billion is uh is around infrastructure
*  around measures to improve the supply side of the economy i think the prime minister would
*  absolutely agree we need these other reforms on the regulatory side and the way business operates
*  in italy but at the same time there is you know there are bridges need to be built there's a
*  a grid that needs to be greened there are a series of opportunities you know for example we talked
*  earlier about climate change and italy is one of the jurisdictions that has huge opportunities in
*  in the hydrogen economy actually and uh there's ways for them to kick start that which would
*  provide an export engine to return to your new book values which was the hardest part of it to write
*  the hardest part what was going through um the history of value theory and trying to condense
*  that uh and i mean you know whether i got that right i mean you're condensing the canonists to
*  a couple of paragraphs the physiocrats uh and then trying to draw the distinction i mean the
*  distinction between the objective value and subjective values you know is is straightforward
*  to uh to draw but to try to give a fair representation of that and what was the most
*  surprising thing you learned writing the book that you hadn't known before you started
*  uh i think the most surprising thing was the
*  i okay the most surprising thing that came to me as i was writing and but this was also in real
*  time in the world was that this point about moving from a trade-off approach for on a big
*  issue so the flattening of values is what i talk about to a hierarchy um and just how powerful that
*  can be in terms of uh market dynamics and investment something i believe but i didn't
*  think i would necessarily see and what i'm talking about is that what over the course of the time of
*  writing that book it started before and it's not a new book it's a new book it's a new book and
*  the time of writing that book it started before and it's really accelerated after is that the
*  world has been moving more and more towards saying okay let's deal with climate change
*  let's anchor this on net zero and then let's figure out how to get there and in that process
*  we talked a lot about the risks around climate change but one of the core points around in the
*  book is that you can flip that risk into value creation if there's a shared objective the shared
*  around net zero and that's what we're seeing today in financial markets and and in the real
*  economy so it surprised me that it i had that thought with me um but i thought i would spend
*  more time in the book about the values that are necessary for markets to function well
*  as opposed to this other point which has the bigger real world impact which is uh if you have
*  a hierarchy of value if you have a clear objective and those don't come along every day
*  but a clear social objective like sustainability net zero said another way
*  just what that just the power of the market that is starting to be unleashed as a consequence
*  and what did you most learn about yourself writing the book um
*  um
*  sorry to hesitate i learned that um i uh there's there was a there's a lot that i didn't know
*  number one uh and in reinforcing that uh and it sounds trite but i'm just reinforcing this
*  point on humility and where that comes in where that is valuable it's not just about knowing that
*  things can fail but also uh recognizing um that uh that that you need to combine that with ambition
*  in order to move things forward last question you wake up each morning surely you still think
*  about central banking what for you is the open question about central banking where you don't
*  know the answer that you think about the most uh you know i gave a speech at jackson hole on this
*  issue uh and i started which is the the future of the international monetary system and how we
*  adjust the international monetary system and i'll say parenthetically that you know we're potentially
*  headed to another example of where the structure of the system is going to cause big problems for
*  the global economy because it's quite realistic sadly that we're going to have a fairly divergent
*  recovery with a number of emerging developing economies uh really lagging because of covid you
*  know not vaccinated uh limited uh policy space and the knock-on effects well major advanced
*  economies move move forward okay so and and that's a world where rates rise in the u.s
*  dollar strengthens and you get this asymmetry and and and the challenge of the way our system works
*  bears down on these economies and so i think about that a lot um and i i gave a speech of jackson
*  hole on this and i started it by saying ben bernanke's last speech to central bankers it
*  was in bauzel the central bank club as he said the one thing i can't figure out he didn't quite put
*  it he's a modest person but he you know basically he said is what to do about the international
*  monetary system it's a big problem and then five years passed and then i gave this speech and i
*  said well this is the one thing i can't figure out i'm going to describe the problem i'll give a
*  half-hearted attempt at trying to fix it so i i continue to think about how we can adjust that
*  uh last point tyler is that i think that there is something in the move to digital the move
*  towards digital currencies uh uh how that shapes out that could help with this it won't necessarily
*  do so but it's in my mind that in in past times when there had been a shift in reserve assets when
*  there had been a rebalancing it starts first with means of payment okay dollars started to take over
*  from sterling as means of payment that helped accelerate shift and and that how we organize
*  the payment system and if we organize it as opposed to we just let it happen organically
*  there's a potential for some rebalancing and i underscore potential i'm not as convinced we'll
*  get it again everyone mark corny's new book is values building a better world for all
*  and mark corny thank you very much thank you tyler it's great pleasure
