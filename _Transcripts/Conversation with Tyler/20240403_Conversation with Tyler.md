Video Description: In The Anxious Generation, Jonathan Haidt explores the simultaneous rise in teen mental illness across various countries, attributing it to a seismic shift from a “play-based childhood” to a “phone-based childhood” around the early 2010s. He argues that the negative effects of this “great rewiring of childhood” will continue to worsen without the adoption of several norms and a more hands-on approach to regulating social media platforms.

But might technological advances and good old human resilience allow kids to adapt more easily than he thinks?

Jonathan joined Tyler to discuss this question and more, including whether left-wingers or right-wingers make for better parents, the wisest person Jonathan has interacted with, psychological traits as a source of identitarianism, whether AI will solve the screen time problem, why school closures didn’t seem to affect the well-being of young people, whether the mood shift since 2012 is not just about social media use, the benefits of the broader internet vs. social media, the four norms to solve the biggest collective action problems with smartphone use, the feasibility of age-gating social media, and more.

# Jonathan Haidt on Adjusting to Smartphones and Social Media  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQoNd9oEeoI)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm chatting with John Height, who needs no introduction.
*  We've already done an episode with him.
*  But I should stress that John has a new book out in late March.
*  It is called The Anxious Generation, How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an
*  Epidemic of Mental Illness.
*  John, welcome.
*  Tyler, great to be back.
*  Great to see you.
*  Let me start with some non-book questions, though they're related.
*  Who makes for better parents, left-wingers or right-wingers?
*  Right-wingers.
*  There's a lot of data on this.
*  There's long been a slight gap where conservatives are a little happier than liberals, and it's
*  not clear why.
*  Is that parenting?
*  Who knows?
*  But what I found in doing the research for the book is that the gap between left and
*  right became a chasm after 2012.
*  So we'll get to the reasons why that is.
*  But the bottom line is when kids are rooted in communities, they don't get washed out
*  to sea by the phone-based childhood, by living by the virtual world.
*  So over and over again, whether we look at left, right, whether we look at religion,
*  we find is that it's the secular kids and the liberal kids who got washed out to sea,
*  got really depressed after 2012, and much less effect on the conservative and religious
*  kids, because I think they're more rooted.
*  Now if parenting is the most important thing, which you seem at many times to believe, why
*  aren't you just a right-winger?
*  Because right-wingers, according to you, get that right.
*  It would be your community, right?
*  You're talking about community.
*  Embrace that community.
*  Well, no, because my community is the academic community where almost everyone's on the left.
*  And I know some conservatives.
*  They're mostly not professors.
*  And I do belong to a synagogue, although I'm an atheist.
*  So yes, I sort of have one toe in each of these worlds.
*  But it's not that simple.
*  I just say, well, my research shows that this produces better outcomes.
*  Therefore I will change my values and goal to be like, no, it doesn't work that way.
*  Your own family aside, who is the wisest person you've interacted with?
*  And why is that the wisest person?
*  Oh my goodness, there's so many.
*  I sometimes, you know, so I'll just list a few that I've thought of.
*  So Barry Schwartz was a professor at Swarthmore for many years.
*  He's retired at Berkeley.
*  He wrote a book on wisdom, but I thought of him as one of the wisest people I knew long
*  before.
*  And part of the point of Barry's book is that wisdom comes from practice, from deep experience
*  and learning.
*  Anyway, there are certain, so as an academic, Barry Schwartz would be one of them.
*  I have a friend, Bill Budinger.
*  He's over 80 years old now and just tremendous life experience.
*  He works behind the scenes to improve democracy, to improve functioning of institutions.
*  And I'm just always so impressed by his ability to understand a complex world and intervene
*  to change it quietly, not calling attention to himself.
*  So I'm finding there are a lot of people all older than me that I just find role models
*  for wisdom.
*  Given our experience with COVID, where the people on the left seem to be obsessed with
*  masks and with social distancing, do you still think of right-wingers as the purity party,
*  as some of your earlier work suggested?
*  Yeah, so right.
*  So this is, so let's look at this.
*  What I found empirically in my work on moral foundations theory is that one of the foundations
*  of morality is purity or sanctity and people on the right, and here we mean the social
*  right.
*  This is very important.
*  They're not conservatives.
*  They shouldn't be put on the right, although they are allies.
*  So when we look at social conservatives who tend to be more religious, they tend to see
*  more non-material properties in things.
*  They see the flag is not just a piece of cloth.
*  The cross is not just a piece of wood.
*  The Bible is not just a book.
*  Whereas secular folk tend to question everything, not treat things as sacred.
*  Everything's open to question.
*  And that's part of the reason why academics tend to be on the left.
*  So that's the big picture about the psych difference.
*  Now, on the far left, there has always been an extreme purity contingent, like the yoga
*  people who believe in chi and these substances moving your body and toxins.
*  So you always have people on the left that have this sort of spiritual thinking that's
*  related to purity.
*  What happened with COVID was that it wasn't about germs.
*  It was about, I think it was about government control versus not.
*  At least that's the way the right saw it.
*  So the right saw it because the right already didn't trust the medical establishment, the
*  authorities.
*  And the authorities, to the extent that a lot of them are academic or medical, they
*  are almost all on the left.
*  And they really made a point over and over and saying, you know, we're on the blue team.
*  We're part of the blue team.
*  They said that implicitly.
*  So I think it quickly became, it just quickly became, are you going to follow the orders
*  to do these things and shut down your business?
*  Or are you going to resist?
*  So that was one where you might expect that, you know, people are more germ phobic or were
*  more afraid of contagion would be on the right.
*  But there are many other factors going on that caused the polarized reaction.
*  I'm still a little confused as to how this fits in with your other views.
*  So I think we know people on the left were keener to close the schools or keep the schools
*  closed.
*  That was a bad thing.
*  They seem to have such bad values by your standards, but you identify with the values
*  of the left.
*  Why is it you think they have better values and then these bad values when it comes to
*  parenting?
*  No, I don't identify with the values of the left.
*  I was always on the left when I was younger, but, and I was always a Democrat.
*  But once I wrote The Righteous Mind, when I finished chapter eight, to write The Righteous
*  in my original goal was like, it was so upsetting to me that George W. Bush won two elections
*  that I thought he shouldn't win because I thought that the Democratic candidates couldn't
*  speak about morality.
*  So I was going to do this writing to explain to the left what they're missing.
*  Like a lot of books, George Lakoff, there are many people who have been writing books
*  for the left to say, shake them and say, look at what you're missing.
*  Stop talking this way.
*  But by the time I wrote chapter seven and eight of The Righteous Mind and really committed
*  to understanding conservatives and libertarians, I realized, wow, there's a lot of wisdom from
*  all three perspectives, liberal, conservative and libertarian.
*  And I, and I, since then I've been a centrist.
*  And then since 2015, since we had essentially a cultural revolution on campus, I mean, very
*  similar psychologically to the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
*  Since we had this incredible liberalism coming from the left on campus, and we have had this
*  incredible liberalism coming from the right, which brought Donald Trump to office, which
*  brought the Unite the Right rally to Charlottesville.
*  So we're now in a time where sort of the potential pathologies of the left have been supercharged
*  by social media.
*  I hope we'll get to that.
*  The potential pathologies of the right have been supercharged by social media and other
*  things.
*  And those of us, so my community is those who are center left to center right.
*  These are the, and libertarians, these are the people who I think are still sane and
*  are still noticeably aligned with the idea of a liberal democracy.
*  What's the most important thing you've learned from reading the Bible?
*  The most important thing I've learned from reading the Bible.
*  Well, my first reading of it, I was horrified when I was in college.
*  So I took it very literally.
*  And that was wrong.
*  So I didn't learn much from my first reading went a long ago.
*  And then I never read it again.
*  But I've gone back to it periodically for stories.
*  And I still haven't read, I really need to read the New Testament.
*  I've read parts of it, but I really need to read the whole thing.
*  And I guess what I would say is that every culture needs a set of stories and moral values,
*  moral principles and metaphors so that they can speak to each other and they can quickly
*  refer to things that have a lot of meanings for the listener.
*  When you read anything from the ancient world, from ancient Greece or Rome, they have this
*  common vocabulary of Homer and of the myths and they can talk to each other.
*  They can refer to all of that.
*  And Western civilization has always had the Bible as that, you know, in the last thousand
*  years or 2000, it was had the Bible.
*  So I think as a set of stories and metaphors, some of which I draw and are very evocative,
*  the Babel story, the Job story is very confusing and difficult.
*  I don't take much from that, but the Babel story really affected me when I reread it
*  and it's become a basis of a lot of my current writing.
*  Now, in general, you've been critical of identitarianism, people identifying too much with a racial
*  or ethnic group.
*  If you think of young people using concepts from psychology as identity labels, like I'm
*  ADHD, I'm autistic, I'm neurodivergent.
*  What do you think of that trend?
*  Well, so to be clear, I'm not against identity.
*  I have no problem with people identifying strongly with a group, with their race, with
*  a disability.
*  When I use the word identitarianism, I don't mean just people have an identity.
*  That's fine.
*  What I mean is two things.
*  It means a theoretical commitment to putting identity first analytically.
*  So in the academic world, what it means is whatever we're talking about, whether it's
*  Shakespeare or inequality or chemistry even, we're going to put identity, especially racial
*  identity first.
*  That's the proper lens.
*  And I'm really opposed to teaching young people to do that.
*  So it's fine if there are some classes here and there at the university, but to the extent
*  that DEI procedures have kind of imported that into like, here's how we're going to
*  orient you.
*  Even when you come to campus, we're going to orient you around identitarianism.
*  What's more worrying than just the analytical lens, which causes what I call monomania,
*  an obsessive focus on one thing, is that identitarianism, at least on campus, is not morally neutral.
*  That is, the groups are not morally equal.
*  The old white supremacists used to rank white people as the best race and black people as
*  the worst race and Asians in the middle.
*  And the new identitarianism kind of reverses that because it's all about power and oppression.
*  And so the oppressors are the bad people, morally bad.
*  The oppressed are the good people, they're morally good.
*  And so the idea of teaching young people to see, if you look at someone, you can see
*  their race, you know whether they're good or bad to some extent.
*  I mean, that's horrible.
*  That was like contrary to what I thought the whole last half of the 20th century was about.
*  So yeah, I'm opposed to identitarianism.
*  But do you think we do that with the disability concept today?
*  We even call it disability.
*  People say with Tourette syndrome, it's not clear they have lesser outcomes than other
*  individuals.
*  So do we need some kind of identitarian movement to invert the fact that a whole set of different
*  kinds of people seem to be called inferior right now?
*  And both the left and the right just go along with this.
*  I mean, should we be outraged by that and we need a new identitarian movement?
*  Well, so there's two empirical questions here.
*  One is a sort of a question about political activism and social change.
*  And obviously the civil rights movement, the women's rights movement, these were identitarian
*  movements that were addressing injustice and that were successful.
*  And if they'd not gotten together, you know, change might have come eventually, but they
*  certainly speeded things up.
*  So I have no problem with identitarian movements organizing for political purposes.
*  I just think they don't belong in the university, in classrooms.
*  Now as for mental conditions, you might say disabilities, that brings us to the second
*  empirical question, which is does tuning, turning up identity, identity, does turning
*  up your sense that I am ADHD or I am, you know, I'm on the spectrum, whatever.
*  Does that actually help young people to achieve better outcomes?
*  And there I don't know, I'm not an expert in that, but part of the point of my book
*  with Greg Lukianoff, The Coddling of the American Mind, was that the ancient idea
*  from the Stoics and the Buddhists, it's not things that upset us, it's an interpretation
*  of them.
*  And so if you identify as a person with a disability or let's take anxiety, young people
*  talk about my anxiety, here I am with my anxiety, practically like a friend.
*  I suspect that identifying with anxiety and depression as part of your identity is probably
*  bad for you and it changes the way you think, it makes you process in a more biased way.
*  So I could well be wrong about this, but overall I think probably we're doing it too much in
*  terms of what's good for young people.
*  Okay, let's turn to your book, which again everyone is called The Anxious Generation.
*  You're worried about screen time.
*  Why isn't it the case that AI quite soon is simply going to solve this problem?
*  That is, you'll have your AI agent read the internet for you or your messages or whatever
*  and if you want it to talk to you or give you images or digest it all, isn't it going
*  to cut down on screen time immensely?
*  No, no, because the point is, it's not just like, oh, kids are looking at a screen, that's
*  bad.
*  No, the reason why I'm so concerned about screen time is primarily, first and foremost,
*  the opportunity cost.
*  So children, this is the whole sort of an odd thing about my book, people might expect
*  it to be about social media is bad and screens are bad, but half of it is about childhood
*  and what is childhood, how does it work and how important play is.
*  And so human children play a lot, all mammal children do, they have to play to wire up
*  their brains, they have to do it a lot.
*  And we all did that, everyone over 40 did that and we did that during a crime wave when
*  there were flashers and perverts and drunk drivers, we didn't used to lock them up.
*  Now we do, it's gotten much safer since the 90s.
*  But we went out when life had some danger in it, we played and played and played, we
*  loved TV, we probably watched two or three hours a day of that, but we had a lot of time
*  unsupervised to play.
*  The problem with screens is that they're so attractive and they came in, the whole virtual
*  world opened up just as we were freaking out about child abduction in the 80s and 90s.
*  So the main argument in the book is that we have taken the healthy, normal, play-based
*  childhood that all mammals need and we swapped it out and gave them a phone-based childhood
*  once we gave them an iPhone.
*  And so the issue isn't like, oh, you have a screen, let's have AI get rid of the screen.
*  No, the issue is you are on this thing which we can call an experience blocker, a phone
*  is an experience blocker.
*  That means you spend a lot less time talking to other people.
*  In the presence of other people, you're not with your friends, you're sleeping less, you're
*  out in nature less, you have less of almost everything.
*  You don't read books, you have no time for anything else.
*  AI is not going to suddenly return kids to a play-based childhood, it's just going to
*  be a new evolution of the phone-based or virtual childhood.
*  So I think once-
*  Screen time seems super inefficient, right?
*  You spend all this time, why not just deal with the digest and maybe in two, three years,
*  AI cuts your screen time by 2X or 3X?
*  Why is that so implausible?
*  Well, Tyler, you're talking as an intellectual who has probably the highest reading throughput
*  rate of any human being I've ever heard of.
*  So for you, you're looking at this like, all this information coming in from screens, we
*  could make it better.
*  I'm sure you're right about that.
*  I'm thinking about children, children who desperately need to spend hours and hours
*  each day with other kids, unsupervised, planning games, enforcing rules, getting in fights,
*  getting out.
*  Instead, what's coming, it's already the case for boys especially, that they can't
*  go over to each other's houses after school because then they can't play video games.
*  When you and I were young, video games were coming in and you'd go over to someone's house
*  and you'd sit next to each other and you'd play Pong or whatever, you know, you'd play
*  a game and you'd joke with each other and you'd eat food and then you'd do something
*  else.
*  So video games used to be fairly healthy.
*  Once they became multiplayer, you wear your headphones, you've got your controller, they're
*  incredibly immersive.
*  Now you have to be alone in your room in order to play them.
*  Now you bring in virtual girlfriends, AI girlfriends and boyfriends.
*  So already Gen Z, those born after 1995, are completely starved of the kinds of social
*  experiences that they need to grow up.
*  In theory, I'm sure you're going to say, well, why can't we just train an AI friend to be
*  like a real friend and get in fights with you sometime?
*  And maybe in theory that's possible, but that's not what it's going to be.
*  It's going to be market driven.
*  It's going to be friends and lovers who are incredibly great for you.
*  You never have to adjust to them.
*  You never have to learn how to deal with difficult people.
*  And it's going to be a complete disaster for human development.
*  Complete disaster strikes me as too strong a term for something that hasn't happened
*  yet.
*  I think you're much too confident about that.
*  What do you mean it hasn't happened yet?
*  Screen time is making kids so miserable.
*  Why won't they seek out methods to make their screen time more efficient?
*  You seem to suggest they won't.
*  It'll just be more and more screen time.
*  AI will help them do this.
*  You get a digest, convert anything to spoken word, right?
*  Just do everything through earbuds if you want to.
*  Wait, I'm sorry.
*  What is your question?
*  Screen time is making kids so miserable.
*  Why won't they use new AI innovations to lessen their screen time if they don't want
*  to stare at the screen, turn messages into voice through earbuds, turn it into images,
*  whatever makes them happier?
*  Why are they so failing to maximize?
*  This is one of the key ideas in the book.
*  What I think makes it different is that I'm a social psychologist with a lot of interest
*  in sociology.
*  I like to think systemically.
*  And over and over again, what you see when you look at this problem is collective action
*  systems.
*  So I teach a class at NYU and my students spend enormous amounts of time on TikTok and Instagram.
*  Many of them spend four, five, even six hours a day consuming content from just these two
*  or three sites.
*  And why don't you just quit?
*  I mean, because they say it blocks out everything else.
*  They don't have time to do their homework.
*  Why don't you just quit?
*  And they all say the same thing.
*  Well, I can't because everyone else is on it because then I'll be left out.
*  I won't know what people are talking about.
*  So over and over again, we see these collective action problems.
*  And there was recently a paper published, Leonardo Burstein, I think it was at the University
*  of Chicago.
*  He and his colleagues, they took these recall students, I believe, and they found out, you
*  know, how much would we have to pay you to stop using TikTok or Instagram?
*  And the answer, you know, $50 or something, but some number.
*  And you might say, oh, well, clearly this is the value of TikTok and Instagram, multiply
*  this out by 240 million people.
*  What an amazing contribution to public value these platforms are.
*  But it turns out that the only reason people would pay is because if everyone else is on
*  it, they have to be on it even though they don't want to be.
*  And when they changed the questions and they said, OK, now, actually, we're going to try
*  to get everyone at your school to get off.
*  And if we can get most of them off, how much would you how much would we have to pay you,
*  you know, from we pay you a lot to you pay us a lot, how much we have to pay you for
*  that outcome where everybody's off.
*  And the answer is, oh, I'd pay you for that.
*  Most of them would pay to be liberated from TikTok or Instagram.
*  And when asked, would you prefer that this was never invented?
*  The majority said yes.
*  So over and over, kids are in a trap and A.I. is not going to liberate from the trap.
*  It's just going to make the trap more enticing.
*  Now, you stress the importance of play, face to face interaction.
*  You also note that in your data, covid lockdowns hardly dent the well-being of young people.
*  Isn't that evidence that face to face interaction isn't that important?
*  And we're just depressed for some other set of reasons.
*  No, no, because when you look at the amount of time that young people have been spending
*  with each other, they were socially distanced by 2019.
*  It's the most one of the most stunning graphs in the book.
*  So you so we plot out there's all these time used to the American time use survey.
*  So you plot out how much time do you spend each day, how many minutes a day talking with
*  friends or being with friends.
*  And not surprisingly, young people used to spend a lot of time, you know, more than two
*  hours a day with their friends, whereas people in their 40s, 50s and 60s, they're spending
*  like 20 or 30 minutes a day on average with their friends because they're married, they've
*  got work, they're not hanging out with their friends very much.
*  So the huge gap between the 15 to 24 year olds and everybody else until 2012.
*  That's the turning point.
*  Kids get a phone.
*  Now it's an experienced blocker.
*  It's a relationship blocker.
*  It's a time together blocker.
*  The graph for minutes per day goes plummeting.
*  And an astonishing fact about that graph, you can find it and forget which chapter in the
*  book is that it's going down really steeply from 2018 to 2019.
*  And it's getting real close to the older people.
*  And then 2019 to 2020 is the covid year.
*  There's no bend in the curve.
*  It's just going down from 2019 to covid lockdown was a drop exactly the same rate as the previous
*  year.
*  And that can't be true.
*  Schools are closing, right?
*  There's six to eight hours a day taken away from being with your friends once the school
*  shut down.
*  So I know, right.
*  So I first of all, well, being doesn't go down much for young people.
*  Wait, what do you mean?
*  It doesn't go down much for young people.
*  What did well in your data say depression, well-being problems with young people that
*  don't really go down when the schools close?
*  So a couple of things there.
*  First, I believe the time you studies don't count school time as time with friends because
*  what they're trying to do is like how much time you're in school, how much time you're
*  sleeping, how much time you're eating, how much time you're playing with friends.
*  I'm pretty sure the the hour what we plot in the graph, it has to be the case.
*  Otherwise, otherwise the covid numbers would plummet even more.
*  So no, it doesn't.
*  We're talking time out of school.
*  That's the first thing.
*  Second thing is time in school used to be mostly with friends.
*  Either interact with your friends or with your teachers.
*  Not anymore.
*  Once everyone has a phone in school, if some kids are texting, then you have to check your
*  text. Most kids check their text during class.
*  My kids go to New York City public schools.
*  They you know, the rule is you're not supposed to take out your phone, but everyone does.
*  And the teachers give up.
*  So so Jean Twankey and I, we analyze PISA data, you know, the big international education
*  survey, and they have six items there about loneliness at school.
*  You know, are you often I feel lonely at school and unrelated items.
*  And those those were very steady around the world until 2012 and between 2012 and 2016,
*  all around the world, except East Asia.
*  But but in the in Europe, North America, Latin America and all those areas, loneliness at
*  school goes up after 2012.
*  Also, after 2012, academic achievement goes down.
*  So once kids get my argument is when you give a kid a phone, a flip phone was fine.
*  Flip phones were not damaging.
*  But a smartphone is a portal to the entire Internet.
*  It's a way for companies to get to you.
*  And so once kids got smartphones around 2012, they stopped talking to other kids.
*  Or like I'm not stop.
*  They spend less time like at lunch.
*  They're not playing with each other as much.
*  They're on their phones in between classes.
*  They're not talking in the hallway.
*  They're on their phones.
*  So the phone has been devastating to time with friends in school, time with friends out
*  of school and time listening to teachers in school, because all the time, all the attention
*  goes to the phone.
*  So you're saying it's not you're saying the covid school shutdowns were not a good natural
*  experiment for kids having less face time with each other.
*  Well, well, first of all, I would say it is.
*  It would be hard to design a better natural experiment.
*  It's truly exogenous.
*  Well, yes.
*  But there's but you're changing so many other things.
*  Also, a part of the story here is that American schools in particular are depressive.
*  That is, if when you look at the suicide rate, there is a big increase.
*  My colleague, Peter Gray, a play researcher, has pointed this out over and over again.
*  The suicide rate goes down substantially in the summer.
*  And I think it goes down.
*  I'm not sure about Christmas vacation.
*  But the point is, it's a very clear every year.
*  As soon as kids go back to school, the suicide rate goes up.
*  And when they're out.
*  So it's not as though schools making kids happy because we do school really badly.
*  So so it's not as so yes, they're freed from school, but so much changes for some kids.
*  Once they were out of school, they actually could see their friends more.
*  Some kids, other kids were more isolated.
*  So I think we'd want to look at what happened to the kids who were stuck in their room
*  alone. I bet those kids went down.
*  And what happened to the kids who are out of school and they have siblings, they have
*  friends in the neighborhood and they saw them more.
*  So it's not a clean experiment.
*  Let me step back a bit and ask you a very long run historical question.
*  It seems to me that European culture and society, maybe starting around 1900, it becomes
*  more neurotic, more depressive, more negative, more hostile.
*  Why did that happen?
*  So these are these are some of the biggest questions in sociology about the transition
*  from what Ferdinand Tunis called it, Gemeinschaft societies to Gesellschaft
*  societies, those that are based on direct personal connections, interactions versus
*  those that are market based.
*  And a lot of stuff happened to get more individualism.
*  So I don't doubt you get more neuroticism, but you also get the happiest countries that
*  have ever been.
*  So when you look at the World Happiness Report, I forget when it started, but you
*  get where it starts early 2010s or late 2000s.
*  What you find repeatedly is that the Scandinavian countries, the Nordic countries, I
*  should say, and the Anglo countries dominate the list of the top 10 or 15.
*  US and UK are sort of down the bottom of that.
*  But, you know, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, those are the happiest
*  countries. And the kids were the happiest, too, until 2012.
*  Then what happens is the adults don't change much, but the kids plummet in all of
*  these countries.
*  But say I ask you also, why does English thought and society seem to become so much
*  weirder in the 17th century?
*  The general point I want to make is there are all these long term historical mood
*  shifts which very often are reversed, like the 1950s maybe are much cheerier.
*  And they're essentially a mystery to us.
*  But we see because of contagion effects, you can have very small impetuses and then
*  big, big shifts in mood that we a century later, we still can't explain.
*  So why isn't 2012 just another one of those?
*  And you're pinning it on smartphones.
*  But these big shifts in mood that we can't explain, that's the norm in history.
*  Well, first of all, can you point to any other shift that we can't explain that
*  happened in a single year?
*  Usually you're talking things that take five or 10 years or 20 years, right?
*  There are turning points, right?
*  17th century British history.
*  All of a sudden, people go crazy.
*  They kill the king.
*  Which year?
*  The French Revolution.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Fine.
*  Sure.
*  Revolutions, of course.
*  I mean, they write those.
*  So yes, things change.
*  But what I want to look at, so there are two ways to explain it.
*  One is you can look at it like what events happened that had sequelae.
*  So killing the king and putting the committee of public safety in charge of chopping
*  people's heads off, I mean, that's going to have a pretty big effect on people's moods.
*  But what I'm interested in here as a social scientist is when you change a parameter.
*  So you take a society, take a bunch of societies, and now let's take some of them
*  and let's ramp up diversity.
*  Let's have a lot of immigration around the world.
*  What effects is that going to have?
*  And I think it'll have a mix of good and bad effects.
*  That's really interesting as a social scientist.
*  Take a bunch of societies, half of them, we super connect them, give everybody
*  telephones, you know, a hundred years ago and others don't get it.
*  What effect is that going to have?
*  And connecting societies usually is a good thing.
*  It certainly makes them more productive.
*  But my argument is that we've been connected for a very, very long time.
*  Now, what changed around 2012 was that we became connected, not by direct
*  connections to each other, but by social media platforms that were now super
*  viral. They weren't that way in 2004 through eight.
*  But once you get the like button, the retweet button, you get threaded comments.
*  That's 2014.
*  Now, the way we're connected is a way that especially encourages rage and conflict.
*  So there's two pieces of evidence when I look at them, they don't seem to support
*  your story out of sample.
*  OK, great. Let's have it first across countries.
*  It's mostly the Anglosphere and the Nordic countries, which are more or less
*  part of the Anglosphere. Most of the world is immune to this and smartphones for
*  them seem fine.
*  So why isn't it just that a negative mood came upon the Anglosphere for reasons we
*  mostly don't understand.
*  And it didn't come upon most of the rest of the world.
*  If we're differentiating my hypothesis from yours, doesn't that favor my
*  view?
*  Well, once you look into the connections and the timing, I would say no.
*  So I think I see what you're saying now.
*  But I think your view would say just for some reason, we don't know, just things
*  changed around 2012.
*  Whereas I'm going to say, OK, things change around 2012 in all these countries.
*  We see it in the mental illness rates, especially of the girls.
*  So I'm going to say it's not just like some mood thing.
*  It's like, A, why is it especially the girls?
*  They're more magnetic, right?
*  Girls are more magnetic in general.
*  That's part of it. You're right.
*  That's part of it. They're just much more open to connection.
*  They're more influenced. They're more subject to contagion.
*  That is a big part of it. You're right.
*  What Zach Rausch and I have found, he's my lead researcher at the After Babel
*  Substack. I hope people will sign up.
*  It's free. We've been putting out tons of research.
*  Zach has really tracked down what happened internationally.
*  And I can lay it out.
*  And now I know the answer.
*  I didn't know it two months ago.
*  The answer is within countries, as I said, it's the people who are conservative
*  and religious, who are protected and the others get washed.
*  The kids get washed out to see psychologically.
*  They feel their life has no meaning.
*  They get more depressed.
*  Zach has looked across countries.
*  And what you find in Europe is that overall, the kids are getting a little worse off
*  psychologically. But that hides the fact that in Eastern Europe, which is getting
*  more religious, the kids are actually healthier now than they were 10 years ago, 15
*  years ago. Whereas in Catholic Europe, they're a little worse.
*  And in Protestant Europe, they're much worse.
*  So it doesn't seem to me like, oh, all the, you know, like New Zealand and Iceland
*  were talking to each other and the kids were sharing memes.
*  It's rather everyone in the developed world, even in Eastern Europe, everyone, their
*  kids are on phones.
*  But the penetration, the intensity was faster in the richest countries, the
*  Anglos and the Scandinavians.
*  That's where people of the most independence and individualism, which was pretty
*  conducive to happiness before the smartphone.
*  But it now meant that these are the kids who get washed away when you get that rapid
*  conversion to the phone based childhood around 2012.
*  But what's wrong with that explanation?
*  Old Americans also seem grumpier to me, right?
*  Maybe that's cable TV, but it's not that they're on their phones all the time.
*  And you know all these studies.
*  But if you try to assess what percentage of the variation in happiness of young
*  people is caused by smartphone usage.
*  Sabine Hassenfelder had a recent video on this.
*  Those numbers are very, very, very small.
*  And that's another measurement that seems to discriminate in favor of my theory,
*  exogenous mood shifts, rather than your theory.
*  Why not?
*  OK, so first of all, we have to talk about correlation coefficients here.
*  So so I've been involved in the debate.
*  Gene Twenge and I are on one side.
*  There are a few researchers, Andrew Shabilsky, Amy Orbin, Candice Rogers, a few
*  others on the other side.
*  It's been a very productive debate.
*  It's all conducted within bounds.
*  And there are three different kinds of experiments, three different kinds of
*  studies, the correlational studies, there are the longitudinal studies, and then
*  there are the true experiments.
*  There's three different kinds.
*  Zach and I and Gene have put them all.
*  We have we have a Google Doc.
*  You go to JonathanHeight.com slash reviews.
*  We have all these Google Docs.
*  You can see abstracts to all the studies.
*  Most of the discussion has been over the correlational studies.
*  And some studies have said, oh, the correlation between time on screens or
*  time on even on social media and or time on screens and some measure of bad
*  mental health is like point oh four.
*  Now, if that was true, I would say, wow, that is that's pretty much nothing.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Every time I dig into the data, whatever studies published to try to debunk this
*  claim, you dig into the data and what do you find if they're looking at screen
*  time overall, then the correlation is low.
*  But whenever you can zoom in on social media, it's bigger whenever you can zoom
*  in on girls, it's bigger.
*  And an amazing thing has happened.
*  The skeptics and me and Gene, we've all reached the same conclusion about the
*  size of the correlation.
*  They say the size of the correlation is between R is point one and point one
*  five, which is small, but it's about the same size as many other public health
*  effects, but that's always for boys and girls combined.
*  What Gene and I have found is that when you look at the girls, now you're in the
*  realm of point one five to point two.
*  So we actually all agree because girls are more affected by that.
*  We actually all agree.
*  The correlation coefficient is around point one seven.
*  That is not true.
*  Like you would never let your kid do something, you know, do something four
*  hours a day that was correlated point one seven with depression, anxiety and
*  self harm.
*  So the effect is actually much bigger than many people realize in the scientific
*  community, because you have to zoom in on girls and social media.
*  Well, I know, talk in your book about the benefits of social media.
*  They seem to me extremely large.
*  I know many talents.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  I know many for kids.
*  No, tell me about the benefits social media for middle school students.
*  11 to 13 years old at emergent ventures.
*  We support many teenagers, young women, many of them, not 13 years old, but very
*  often 16 to 19 years old.
*  They're doing science.
*  They're remarkably smart.
*  They get in touch with their collaborations and with each other using
*  social media, they exchange information.
*  They're doing phenomenally well.
*  They're an incredible generation, smarter, more dynamic, probably more productive
*  than any other scientific generation ever.
*  And that's because of social media.
*  Now you might think the costs outweigh that, but there's no mention in your
*  book of the benefits that I can see.
*  Oh, no, no, no.
*  Well, well, I do have a section on the benefits.
*  It's short, because so here's what I, here's what I say.
*  First, if the discussions of benefits are always for older teens, the benefits of
*  being able to collaborate with people far away when you're 16 or 18, I totally
*  see that for middle school students.
*  They don't need that.
*  They need to develop basic social skills and be with each other.
*  So I've never heard anyone make a good case that 11, 12 and 13 year olds
*  benefit from social media.
*  Second, whenever I hear this argument, it usually seems to conflate the
*  internet with social media.
*  So like during COVID, you know, a lot of people say, Oh, thank God for social
*  media.
*  What would the kids do if they didn't have social media?
*  To which I say, yeah, can you imagine if the only way they could connect was by
*  calling them up on the phone or texting them or Skype or zoom or FaceTime or
*  multiplayer video games or many, many other ways that the internet allows you
*  to connect social media is very different from everything else.
*  Social media is a distorting mirror.
*  It's not a connection device.
*  It, well, it is that, but it's a weird connection device.
*  So that's, that would be my first response is don't confuse.
*  Don't tell me, don't confuse social media and the internet.
*  We need the internet.
*  The internet is amazing.
*  Remember what it was like in the nineties when we all discovered it was one of the
*  greatest things we've ever seen.
*  It didn't harm mental health.
*  It was good for democracy.
*  That's not true anymore in our modern.
*  So, so these purported benefits of social media, I'm just not seeing the
*  evidence for it, which is Twitter.
*  Any studies is Twitter internet or social media, social media.
*  Well, that's how they all meet these kids.
*  That's how they get in touch with each other.
*  They see what they're working on.
*  It seems to me just an enormous benefit.
*  It could be the case.
*  Maybe only 5% of teenagers benefit from this Twitter function, but that
*  could by far outweigh the costs.
*  Well, hold on a second.
*  Okay.
*  Let's, let's suppose it's 5% benefit.
*  Um, and I'll, okay.
*  And if you'll grant me that probably the costs that way, the benefits for
*  middle school students, cause that's where the girls seem to really go off track.
*  Will you grant me that, that the cost benefit ratio is probably negative when
*  you're 11 and 12 for being on, on, on Instagram and Tik TOK.
*  I think it is likely that girls age 12 to 14 are worse off because of Instagram.
*  I would go to that.
*  Okay.
*  Good.
*  So if we agree on that now, at least let's focus where it's harder for me,
*  which is what do we do about 15 and 16 year olds?
*  We all agree 18 year olds can be on, you know, but let's, but let's take 14, 15.
*  Cause I favor raising the age to 16.
*  I think the, I think social media is just not a place.
*  It's not appropriate for children.
*  The internet, of course, has so many amazing things.
*  I'm not saying keep them within the internet and saying, uh, social media
*  having an account where you're fed material, you know, your fed content by
*  algorithms, that is not appropriate for children.
*  The age should be 16.
*  So let's, you and I talk about, uh, 14 and 15 year olds.
*  But these kids start connecting with each other when they're 13.
*  Maybe I only meet them when they're 17, 18, but they get going on
*  science and learning definitely at age 13.
*  Boy, can you imagine if they didn't have Twitter, there's no way they
*  could find each other is there?
*  It would be much harder.
*  I find a little harder.
*  Come on.
*  It would be something like social media, right?
*  It may not be Twitter.
*  So many websites, there are blogs, there are podcasts.
*  They would find each other.
*  You don't have to have an algorithmically driven platform to find
*  other kids who share your interest.
*  So I disagree with that, that premise, but now, but I'm
*  switching my Twitter to no algorithm with one click and they do too.
*  They choose.
*  True.
*  They all make this decision.
*  Okay.
*  But wait, wait, Tyler, wait.
*  So this is actually, wait, you know what?
*  I want to turn the tables here and I want to ask you some things because
*  there's something that I'm really puzzled by and I want to know your
*  print opinion of it.
*  So, um, it seems, it seems to me in talking to my students, members of
*  Gen Z have to spend so much time servicing their network connections
*  many hours a day.
*  It's the first thing they do when they open their eyes in the morning.
*  It's the last thing they do before they close them at night is check
*  their notifications messages.
*  And in between this lot of what they do, they don't have much attention
*  leftover to do anything.
*  Now there was a conversation between Pat Patrick Collison and Sam Altman,
*  uh, last May, I think it was, and, uh, Patrick pointed out to Sam.
*  He said, this is the first time since the seventies that there has not been
*  a major person in software under 30.
*  Cause you know, it was, it was Steve jobs and Bill Gates.
*  They got someone, they were very young, you know, in the teens and twenties,
*  they found a company in the twenties.
*  Um, um, you know, and, and, and the millennials, I mean, in the nineties
*  and the, and the tooth, but the two thousands, the millennials were amazing.
*  Um, but Gen Z, uh, isn't starting companies.
*  Gen Z isn't doing things.
*  And so my question for you is you said that this is the most productive,
*  inventive, creative generation.
*  It seems to me, you could make the case that it seems to be possibly the least.
*  And what I'd like to know from you is, is there, can you name people, can
*  you name members of Gen Z who really have come out big and really had a
*  big impact on the world?
*  Can you name anyone?
*  And there's only two names that come up.
*  What are yours?
*  Well, let me first say that in any area where we can truly measure performance,
*  like take chess, young people, including young women, they're just doing better
*  and better than ever before.
*  Yeah.
*  I can use social networks, but they're not ruining the young women,
*  chess players, right?
*  They're just improving all the time.
*  Okay.
*  That's telling you something about the smart people in society.
*  I think that you can't just be a programmer alone that the nature of
*  companies now is not that you do it in your dorm room at Harvard, but it
*  requires synthetic abilities.
*  So it's Sam Altman at OpenAI in his late thirties is the new paradigm, but it's
*  because of the nature of production that's changed.
*  Fair enough.
*  Fair enough.
*  But even still, even still, can you tell me, so my concern is, you know, Gen Z,
*  I mean, they're working hard, but so much of their effort is within the, within
*  the black hole of, of the prestige economy within social media.
*  So we can point to Mr.
*  Beast as a well-known Gen Z person, but that kind of proves the rule that it's
*  all about doing things to be recognized within this prestige economy, to get
*  likes and followers, that's to get prestige and nothing comes out of that
*  world to influence the world that the rest of us live in.
*  Please tell me I'm wrong.
*  I visited Anthropic and OpenAI.
*  A lot of the people there were extremely young.
*  I don't know exact birth dates.
*  They're doing amazing things.
*  None of them are famous, but their research teams are quite small.
*  Like those individuals are decisive.
*  And again, with the immersion ventures, I'm interviewing young people from
*  ages like 16, often through 25 through 30, five to eight times a week, every week
*  of my life, they're just awesome.
*  They're way better than kids were in my time.
*  They're smarter.
*  They're more productive.
*  They're more attentive.
*  They're more disciplined.
*  I see there's problems at the median, but they're just better in every way.
*  And I don't see how that fits into your account.
*  Well, first of all, I will grant that the internet in general makes it much easier
*  for you to find the very top people.
*  Cause let's suppose that I was right.
*  That because Gen Z now has to devote five to 10 hours a day, literally five to 10
*  hours a day to servicing their network connections, plus consuming content.
*  They have to keep up with Netflix.
*  They do YouTube shorts, short form.
*  So, so if we take five to 10 hours a day out of most of their lives, most of them
*  will not be very productive, but, um, they're always are going to be geniuses.
*  They're always going to be amazing young people and you're able to find them.
*  So your anecdotal experience that you're finding all these amazing young people
*  doesn't convince me that the average, um, is getting better.
*  Whatever problems there are.
*  I mean, why not just think we'll adjust to them?
*  Now I've read your page 81 where you discuss this, but I don't think
*  you have any actual facts.
*  You just say, you don't think people can adjust, but we adjusted from moving from
*  a hunter gatherer society to agriculture.
*  We adjusted to having fire.
*  We and thus adjusted to urbanization.
*  We adjusted to many truly major trends that overall have been great, but in
*  their early stages were far from easy.
*  Right.
*  Why isn't you have this weird distinction between internet and social media, which
*  I don't really buy, but why isn't what's happening now?
*  Just another example of that.
*  There's some problems we're going to adjust.
*  Medium term benefits will be enormous.
*  Let's get on with the adjustment.
*  Okay.
*  That you could be right about that.
*  That is definitely within the realm of possibility.
*  I could just be, you know, if this is the early days and I am overreacting,
*  you could be right.
*  Um, but let's think of another class of events.
*  Suppose we change our diet so that there's just no vitamin C in it.
*  And our kids start getting scurvy.
*  Would you say, well, you know, they'll adapt to that.
*  Phil adapt to scurvy.
*  We'll figure out how to live with scurvy.
*  Do you think like, is that going to be something we'll adapt to?
*  Well, that's what the Aztecs did.
*  They put Nishtimal in their tortillas and they don't get scurvy for that reason.
*  Right.
*  Well, okay.
*  So they didn't eat oranges.
*  They did adapt to it.
*  I see.
*  Okay.
*  Ah, I see.
*  Okay.
*  So, so what I'm trying to argue here is that humans as mammals have certain
*  requirements in childhood and those are for a lot of play, face to face
*  interaction, eye contact, synchrony, a lot of those things.
*  And my argument is that the virtual life, the phone based life is blocking that.
*  So it's not like they're going to be able to grow up without that stuff.
*  But I think your argument is that AI will play the role of whatever the Aztecs did.
*  AI will allow kids to basically just sit in the room for 18 years and still get
*  face to face contact, virtually, synchrony, humor, social skills.
*  So right.
*  Do you, that they could in theory sit in their room alone for 18 years and just
*  be fed food and social experiences.
*  Do you think we, that you think we could do that?
*  So it's one scenario, but the more optimistic scenario is you talk about this
*  five to 10 hour flow of messages you need to manage AI will do that for you.
*  And you'll have a lot more time again and you'll spend it meeting up with your
*  friends, like it is fun, right?
*  The fact that it's fun means it's not just a public good.
*  Kids will find ways of doing this.
*  Oh, meeting up with kids have a great time with her together, but being on social
*  media is not necessarily very fun.
*  It's work.
*  It takes a huge amount of time, especially for the girls.
*  They're very anxious about it.
*  AI will do that work for us.
*  If we wanted to.
*  Fine.
*  Okay.
*  So if you're suggesting that we could outsource all of that bad stuff to AI so
*  that kids don't actually have to know what's going on in their friends' lives.
*  They don't have to keep up with who said what to whom, because they're never
*  going to actually meet their friend in person.
*  Then I would say, well, maybe that could work because we're all just alone in a
*  room.
*  But if you're saying that they will actually meet up in person and then they
*  each don't know what's going on in each other's lives because their AI took care
*  of it, like what do you say?
*  They read a digest or they hear a digest, right?
*  Manage the flow.
*  We're a year away from this working.
*  You know, Google Gemini is working on it already.
*  It's almost there.
*  Again, in theory, you could be right.
*  And looking at the long history of humanity, and I know you're, you know, I'm
*  I'm very sympathetic to Matt Ridley's book, Rational Optimist, you know, Steve
*  Pinker's points about the better angels of our nature.
*  So, and Robert Wright, Robert Wright's book, Non Zero.
*  So you may be right that I think I'm right that we're going into a dip.
*  It's gigantic in terms of mental health impact, suicide rates, self harm,
*  hospitalizations, missed potential.
*  But you might be right that this is early days.
*  And in 30 to 50 years, the next generation, like we're two generations from now,
*  could be so optimized that they're like superhuman.
*  Do we agree on that?
*  I don't know what superhuman means, but I think these things are going to go well.
*  Let's put it that way.
*  Okay.
*  And, and you think they're going to go well because that's been the trajectory
*  over the last couple of centuries?
*  People can adjust to an amazing variety of circumstances and they take tools and
*  figure out how to use them for better rather than worse and more and more kids
*  will secede from the bad parts of social media.
*  They'll just say, I'm in a form of like a little polycule, but without sex.
*  And my polycule will be based around not doing so much social media.
*  Like my friends and I in high school, we didn't go to parties.
*  We seceded from that.
*  We were out of many loops, but we had a blast.
*  And I think, because you were together.
*  Yeah.
*  People can still do that.
*  Yeah.
*  I agree.
*  There's too much homework by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that's right.
*  No, especially in the early days.
*  There's no reason for it.
*  You know, first, second, third, fourth grade.
*  So, okay.
*  I think we are reaching some agreement here.
*  Which is that we have to find it with that.
*  The technology is currently hooking kids into a social, uh, uh, into a
*  collective action problem.
*  Most of them say they're only on it or on it this much because they have to be,
*  they don't want to be, they wish things could be different.
*  So they're kind of trapped now.
*  I think we agree that if, if we could liberate the kids from that, so that
*  they could really spend a lot more time hanging out together, unsupervised,
*  they would be better off, they would be happier, and then they could have many
*  of the benefits of, of the technologies.
*  I agree with you on that.
*  That's actually what I'm trying to do in my book.
*  So in the book, after I go through the analysis of collective action problems,
*  I say, here are four norms that will solve for the biggest collective
*  action problems, and if we can do this, then we would liberate kids to do
*  just what you were saying.
*  So the four norms are no smartphone before high school.
*  Kids can have flip phones to communicate.
*  Flip phones were not harmful.
*  You can use them to communicate, to say, I'll see you at four, let's meet at the
*  mall, but you're not going to type out long things about what someone said and
*  how you feel you're going to wait till you see each other in person.
*  So no smartphones before high school.
*  Kids can still have laptops.
*  They can have, uh, you know, other things, but, but it's the, it's the constant
*  connection in your pocket.
*  That's what has really done them in.
*  That's what brought about the phone based shots.
*  So that's number one.
*  Second norm, no social media till 16.
*  So you have the most of the rest of the internet.
*  You can connect in all kinds of ways, but to be, to open an account, I'm not saying
*  they can't see a YouTube, a YouTube video, of course, or a Tik TOK video.
*  I'm saying they cannot sign a contract with a company to give away their data,
*  to be exposed, to have an account, uh, to have a, a, a name, to, to get sucked
*  into the whole performance game.
*  And, uh, let's just delay that till 16.
*  The evidence shows, and actually this is from, um, orbit and Shibilsky, a study
*  that a couple of years ago, that the maximum damage is done to girls around 11
*  to 13 and boys around 14 to 15.
*  So let's just delay it till 16.
*  That's the second.
*  Third is phone free schools.
*  Um, there is no benefit at all that no one's ever pointed out a benefit, um, to
*  have letting kids have their phones with them during class.
*  Now in high school, maybe they use them for some lesson plans.
*  I'm not saying there's zero benefits, but the distraction effect is so gigantic.
*  Um, that as long as you can text, you will text.
*  Uh, so just, you know, put the phone in a phone locker or in a yonder
*  pouch when you arrive and you get it, when you go home, that's the third one.
*  Phone free schools that would give them seven hours a day where they could talk
*  to each other and to their teachers.
*  And then the fourth one is far more childhood independence and free play.
*  And this is all the Lenore Skanezy work, free range kids.
*  Uh, she and I and Peter Gray founded an organization called let grow.
*  If there are any parents listening, if you have kids under 12, please
*  go to let grow.org.
*  We have all kinds of, uh, all kinds of ideas and advice and ways that you can
*  give your kid a healthier, more play-based childhood, which fosters
*  development, happiness, competence.
*  So those four norms, if we could do it, then I think we would roll back a lot of
*  the mental illness.
*  We'd free kids up for a lot more time to play with each other and hang out together.
*  Um, and then I'd be much less worried.
*  Now, for instance, it depends what you mean by them.
*  No social media before 16.
*  Is that enforced by the government or by parents?
*  So ideally to, to, well, first of all, the parents can't really enforce this stuff.
*  Um, it's like saying, you know, you can't drink alcohol before 21, but it's up to
*  the parents to enforce that.
*  Bars bars never have to check ID.
*  The parents should stop their kids from going into bars.
*  Well, how do you do that?
*  Unless you lock them up at home.
*  So it's unrealistic to think that parents could actually do this.
*  And many parents, parents, you know, you've got families with two married parents
*  with graduate degrees who are really concerned about this.
*  They can't stop their kids from getting on these platforms because there's
*  always ways around it.
*  The platforms have to do something.
*  They have to do something to help us.
*  They do nothing, nothing.
*  They know when a kid is a lesson, the minimum age is currently 13.
*  They don't enforce it.
*  They know when a kid is living, they won't do anything to kick these kids off.
*  So that has to change.
*  But I'm a, I'm a parent.
*  Say I have a 15 year old.
*  I want the kid on Twitter.
*  Is the government going to stop me?
*  So here's what I hear.
*  So there are a couple of options here.
*  What I know to tell me your number one option, what like, what's your view?
*  You're talking around it a bit.
*  Okay.
*  My number one option is that the age be raised from 13 to 16 and enforced.
*  So the government will stop me from raising my 15 year old the way I want to.
*  I'm totally against that.
*  Well, hold on a second.
*  Hold on a second.
*  Um, the current way it's written, this goes back.
*  This is COPPA, the child online privacy protection act says that it was done in
*  1998, I think it was for seven.
*  Um, it says that like these big cut, like AOL or, you know, time warner or whatever
*  it went in the early internet.
*  Um, at what age are you allowed to take data from a child without that child's
*  parents permission or knowledge or assent at what age?
*  And you think 18.
*  Well, you'd think it should be 18 because you're signing a contract.
*  The terms of services, a contract.
*  So you'd think it'd be 18, but they said, well, that's not realistic.
*  So let's make it lower.
*  And, uh, uh, Ed Markey was in the house then he said 16, he thought was the
*  best age, but lobbyists, they got it pushed down to 13 and he said, he knew
*  it was the wrong age at the time, but it was the best he could do.
*  So it's 13.
*  Um, and at, uh, so that's the agent which you're allowed to sign a contract
*  without your parents' knowledge.
*  Now, if we just push that up to 16, then the law would be with your
*  parents' permission, you can do it.
*  So in some versions of this, of this legislation, you would say the age
*  is 16 without parents' permission.
*  But if you have your parents' permission, then it can be as low as 14 or 13.
*  So what's wrong with that?
*  Are you saying if parents, if parents can give permission, you still would object?
*  No, I'm fine with it being up to the parents, but your view is also, it
*  should be up to the parents and the government doesn't step into this.
*  Well, there are parental controls on Instagram as you know, much better
*  than I do and not that many parents do it.
*  Right.
*  So with parents, it's okay.
*  I don't see why your stuff is such a big change, at least on that issue.
*  Look, Tyler, very few people are able to use parental controls.
*  Well, even people, again, people who are very well educated, who are trying,
*  they're very, they're complicated.
*  There are ways around it at some point.
*  So let's say, all right, let's take pornography.
*  Do you think it's okay for 11 year olds to be on Pornhub?
*  There's no risk.
*  They don't even have to say they're 18.
*  They just go on.
*  Do you think that's okay?
*  You look, you're shifting something back to me.
*  There's a dual issue that either it's up to the parents, in which case your
*  recommendation won't matter much or the government steps in, which you won't say
*  you're for, but at least in your, in your XL and ed talk, you at least raise the
*  possibility.
*  So I'm asking you, are you for the government stopping me from having my
*  15 year old on Twitter?
*  Yes or no.
*  No.
*  So it's up to the parents.
*  No.
*  Then it's up to.
*  I'm in favor of helping parents to raise their kids the way they want.
*  Right now, the number one concern of parents all across America is not
*  their kid getting pregnant or abducted or in a car accident.
*  It's social media and the internet.
*  That's what parents are mostly afraid of.
*  It's the number one concern by far, even for parents of six and seven year olds.
*  Okay.
*  So something's going terribly wrong here.
*  The government set up the internet such that there are zero, zero guardrails by
*  age, nothing.
*  You just, if you're nine, you just say, you know, nothing.
*  The government set up that way.
*  They gave blanket immunity to these industries.
*  They said, and not only are there no age guards, but you have complete
*  protection from lawsuits.
*  No one can sue you.
*  So what we have is a complete goddamn, I want to curse here, disaster.
*  Okay.
*  It was set up by the government to, to run this way.
*  It's not like any other industry and it is destroying a generation.
*  The mental health catastrophe is bigger than anything we've ever seen.
*  And what I'm saying is not the government should decide.
*  What I'm saying is we parents are stuck in these horrible
*  collective action problems.
*  We cannot get out.
*  We cannot get out.
*  But you haven't told us how to get out.
*  So now you're raising the possibility.
*  So parents can sue say Metta Facebook.
*  If the kid gets on and the parent didn't actually approve it, given how
*  many customers there are, isn't that just destroying the company?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  Wait, so let's, so let's look at this is slightly off topic, but
*  it's very relevant here.
*  Um, section two 30 of the communications decency act gave them a protection
*  from liability for what other people post.
*  That makes sense, but it's been interpreted so broadly by some lower
*  courts that if parents want to sue, uh, Metta or tick tock because it
*  addicted their kids because they built design features like the constant
*  refresh, the, you know, eternal, uh, you know, eternal feed, they designed
*  it to be as addictive as possible, but they can't be sued for their design
*  choices.
*  That's insane.
*  So the government has taken a hands-off approach so far, and it's been a
*  complete disaster.
*  What I'm saying is we need to have these companies held liable for their
*  decisions, not for some jerk posting some, some false thing.
*  I understand that principle.
*  They have to be, the government has to return liability to the industries.
*  We saw that in those hearings a couple of weeks ago, um, the, you know, that
*  section two 30 is gifted.
*  So that's the first thing.
*  And the second is the government has to tell the platforms that they have some
*  responsibility, some for age gating right now, they have none, nothing.
*  And that is completely untenable.
*  So what I would like to see is take the law that you passed 13 with no
*  enforcement, make it 16 with enforcement.
*  And then we can talk about whether we want to have a parental permission
*  feature.
*  That would be okay with me.
*  Um, where you have to be 16 to sign a contract and give away your data.
*  But if your parents want you to have an account on TikTok at 13 and give away
*  your data to the Chinese government, they can choose to do that.
*  And let's see if TikTok and meta can figure out a way to do parental
*  permission.
*  I'm betting they can.
*  Well, Facebook has billions of users or you could call them customers.
*  Let's say they have it.
*  They're not customers.
*  Well, they're both.
*  They don't give them money.
*  No, but how many customers.
*  They're customers, right?
*  You want to please your customers.
*  But the point is, let's say, let's say meta has a 1% failure rate in trying to
*  do this, which would be, you know, an amazingly good performance.
*  Very hard to pull off.
*  That'd be incredible.
*  Oh, I would give them, they should get a bonus.
*  They're sued out of existence in your scenario because they have billions of
*  users and 1% yes.
*  Like how much are these lawsuits good for?
*  Wait, are you saying 1% are harmed or are you saying 1% are on underage?
*  Let's say 99 out of a hundred times when the parent doesn't want the kid on, the
*  kid isn't on, but there's a failure rate of 1% and the parents can sue.
*  Oh my God.
*  I would be so...
*  The company would disappear.
*  There'd be lawsuits.
*  No, no.
*  If, if any company achieved 95%, let's say, then they would have some protection
*  from liability because clearly they are doing a lot to Agegate.
*  But right now you go to most, you know, most middle schools, everyone's, everyone
*  has an Instagram account.
*  So they're doing nothing now.
*  Whereas if they could, if they could get to 95%, I would say, wow, you know, thank
*  you, Mark Zuckerberg, you really are doing what you said.
*  You really are trying to keep underage users off.
*  But we, but right now there's nothing, there's no obstacle to signing up.
*  In two years, won't AI make most age gating just flat out impossible for everything?
*  Um, no, there's all kinds of ways that you could do age gating either by building
*  something into the hardware, building something into the software.
*  There are, there's, there are so many different ways of age verification now
*  that they have their own trade industry.
*  There's like the age verification something association.
*  There are a lot of different methods.
*  And what I would like to see, um, is governments could mandate just as they
*  mandate that bars and casinos have to check age, right?
*  I assume there's some law that puts the responsibility on the casino or the strip
*  club or whatever, right?
*  That these places, the government said you have to enforce the age limit, right?
*  Sure.
*  And but fakes are very easy.
*  Even in my day, fakes are easy.
*  But the point is it's, it's not effortless to walk in.
*  You could get caught.
*  So I'm not saying we have to get a hundred percent.
*  If we can get to 90, 95%, I would be thrilled right now.
*  We're at zero.
*  There's just no obstacle.
*  So, um, so that's what I'm saying.
*  If they, if, uh, um, if the government were to mandate that Facebook and all
*  these platforms, they have to do age verification, but not mandate the way.
*  So in Louisiana, they said for porn, you have to show your driver's license.
*  I don't agree with that.
*  It shouldn't be the government says you have to show a government
*  ID to use an internet.
*  I don't want that.
*  But they could say to porn hub, you have to provide age gating.
*  We leave it up to you how, but it has to be 90% or something reliable.
*  Yeah.
*  And what I'm imagining is porn hub and meta would offer, here's five different
*  ways that you could establish your age.
*  Pick one.
*  What do you think about that?
*  I don't think it's going to matter much.
*  I think a lot of AI, not only because of AI, there's a long history as you, as
*  you know, of trying to stop what your kids do, even before social media,
*  things matter a bit, the effects of those interventions, they
*  strike me as pretty small.
*  Well, you know, do what percentage of kids shoplift regularly?
*  Would you say is that most kids are shoplifting every day?
*  Would you say?
*  No, not at all.
*  It's a physical thing.
*  No, but right.
*  But the point is that with shoplifting, you can do it, but it's risky.
*  There's some possible cost.
*  Whereas if we said, you know what?
*  Total honor system, no enforcement, no cameras, no punishment.
*  I think shoplifting would go way, way up.
*  If kids could just walk into the store and take whatever they want,
*  shoplifting would go up.
*  And what I'd like to see-
*  Napster shoplifting was huge, right?
*  That was the online version.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, that's right.
*  That's right.
*  When there is zero cost for taking something, people take things.
*  And in the same way here, when there is absolute zero cost, you can lie as much
*  as you want about your age and nothing will ever happen to you.
*  What I'd like to see is if let's say Meta took this seriously, uh, and they had a
*  policy of if we do, if we find out that you are under 13, then you will be, your
*  account will be closed and you won't even be li- you won't be able to come back on
*  until you're 13 and a half or 14 or there'd be some penalty or you'll have
*  your distribution will be, there'll be some penalty for lying about your age.
*  That would really change the incentives of the kids.
*  An excellent episode.
*  Thank you, John.
*  Repeating to everyone.
*  Here is John's book, The Anxious Generation, How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is
*  Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.
*  Oh, thanks so much, Tyler.
*  I hope listeners will sign up for the After Babel Substack.
*  It's free.
*  I hope they'll enjoy the book and I know they enjoy hearing the way you question
*  people. It's different from everyone else's.
*  I almost never get worked up and somehow Tyler, you got me worked up.
*  It was great fun.
*  I am flattered by that.
*  Thank you very much, John, for coming on.
