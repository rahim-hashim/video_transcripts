# Does Paul McCartney still have a Liverpudlian accent?  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLxjaaZYLmc)
*  A related question, does Paul McCartney still have a Liverpoolian accent? Because he pretends
*  not to. If you listen to 1963 Paul McCartney, or more recent Paul McCartney, it's a very
*  different way of speaking. But underneath, do you still hear that he's from Liverpool?
*  Oh, 100%. See, the thing is, I just think he sounds so scouse to this day. I think I think,
*  I know, and it's softened because a bit like me, I haven't lived in Merseyside since I was 18,
*  really. I came back for a bit and then moved away again. So I really hear his accent. But I know
*  what you're saying, like those early, like the accent's really thick and it's very guttural,
*  like it's right back from the throat, it's softened. But to me, I so hear the accent.
*  I'm like, oh my God, he's so scouse.
