**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro)
*  Let's say we send you back in time, let's say to southwestern Germany, it's an area [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=0.0s)]
*  you know a lot about, during the Black Death, and you can give people advice, what they [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=4.84s)]
*  should do to cope. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=9.06s)]
*  What do you tell them? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=10.06s)]
*  I think maybe the first thing I would say is don't believe what your priest says because, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=11.06s)]
*  I mean, one of the things I do in the book is I try to assess the effect of different [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=17.28s)]
*  social institutions. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=21.48s)]
*  One of them is religion. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=23.12s)]
*  Although religion did provide consolation and a certain amount of charitable support, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=25.06s)]
*  one of the very, very salient things it did during the Black Death was that most religious [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=31.58s)]
*  figures admonished people in order to induce God to take away the plague. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=39.06s)]
*  It was essential for them to get together in processions and church services, not observe [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=46.34s)]
*  social distancing, but engage in super-spreader events. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f5a1hwilro&t=52.9s)]
