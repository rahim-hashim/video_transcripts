Video Description: A conductor, harpsichordist, and organist, Masaaki Suzuki stands as a towering figure in Baroque music, renowned for his comprehensive and top-tier recordings of Bach's works, including all of Bach's sacred and secular cantatas. Suzuki's unparalleled dedication extends beyond Bach, with significant contributions to the works of Mozart, Handel, and other 18th-century composers. He is the founder of the Bach Collegium Japan, an artist in residence at Yale, and conducts orchestras and choruses around the world.

Tyler sat down with Suzuki to discuss the innovation and novelty in Bach's St. John's Passion, whether Suzuki's Calvinist background influences his musical interpretation, his initial encounter with Bach through Karl Richter, whether older recordings of Bach have held up, why he trained in the Netherlands, what he looks for in young musicians, how Japanese players appreciate Bach differently, whether Christianity could have ever succeeded in Japan, why Bach's larger vocal works were neglected for so long, how often Bach heard his masterworks performed, why Suzuki's  favorite organ is in Groningen, what he thinks of Glenn Gouldâ€™s interpretations of Bach, what contemporary music he enjoys, what he'll do next, and more.

Recorded October 18th, 2023

# Masaaki Suzuki on Interpreting Bach  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSRtjsrqzsM)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm here in New York City with Masaki Suzuki.
*  Masaki Suzuki is one of the greatest musical creators and producers of our time.
*  He has recorded the entire set of Bach sacred cantatas, which in my collection amounts to
*  I think 55 compact discs.
*  He has recorded all of the secular cantatas.
*  These are generally acknowledged to be the most important and best recordings of Bach's
*  cantatas music ever.
*  He is recording complete the organ music of Bach, so he also is a world-class organist,
*  and is recording the complete harpsichord music of Bach, works that are commonly acknowledged
*  to be in the top tier.
*  So there's simply no one else I know of with this kind of record of production and quality
*  and dedication and inspiration.
*  He also has recorded a good deal of Mozart, Handel, many other 18th century composers.
*  He founded the Bach Collegium Japan in 1990.
*  He teaches also as a professor at Yale University and does many other things as well.
*  Masaki Suzuki, welcome.
*  Thank you for your invitation.
*  It's a really great pleasure to come here.
*  I have many questions for you, but to start with Bach, St. John's Passion, 1724.
*  If you had to explain to us in its most fundamental sense what was new in St. John's Passion that
*  Bach did, what was the nature of that innovation?
*  Well, probably no one expected at the time to have that dramatic passion, because the
*  tradition of the bass tone derives from the reading the Bible in the liturgy.
*  So it's probably, firstly, it was only thought of the Bible reading, but not simply reading,
*  instead of the citation, so with some tones.
*  So that was developed to the music, passion music.
*  And by the time of Bach, that was already developed as a kind of oratorio passion.
*  So that was actually the very dramatic experience already.
*  But still Bach's time on the one week before the Easter, the passion of the Johann Walter
*  was still performed.
*  That means really only F major chord from the beginning until the end, just to recite
*  all the Bible texts and so on.
*  That was still performed.
*  So the very first passion of Bach in the lapses time was the St. John Passion, which was a
*  really shocking experience for everyone, I thought.
*  And in terms of choral work, what is new in that passion?
*  Choral work, yes.
*  Yes, that is a very well, the structure consists of the choir and the as the toolbar, so the
*  mass of people, the shouting and so on.
*  At the same time, the choir was also supposed to sing the choral.
*  And so the multifunctional all the time, choral.
*  And do you think of St. John's Passion as a Christian work, or you conduct it as a Lutheran
*  work or drawing from a particular gospel?
*  How do you think about that theologically?
*  Well, from my point of view, St. John Passion, we are doing this work as the just a simple
*  general sacred music, sacred work.
*  And we are performing this music not in the liturgy anymore.
*  We are doing in the concert.
*  So there are plenty of ways to accept or receive or appreciate this music.
*  So we are doing simply as the musicians to do our best to do the sound wise and text
*  wise, everything as good as possible.
*  So I think the music can work afterwards to the individuals, you know, the according
*  to their situation or thoughts.
*  And your own background is Calvinist.
*  Does that in any way shape how you approach the work?
*  Yeah, that's a really good question, actually.
*  I was asked many times, why are you not Lutheran?
*  But there's almost a kind of predestination in the work.
*  Jesus seems to know what's coming more than in other parts of the Bible.
*  Exactly.
*  Yes.
*  So I actually I'm very grateful to be a Calvinist because Calvin was probably the well, I don't
*  know, I'm not no theologian, I'm no historian, but still, according to my knowledge, Calvin
*  was one of the first reformation reformator who acknowledged the value of the activity
*  and culture of this world, not only in that world in heaven.
*  So I think the it is very often said Calvin was not so the sympathy for the music or culture
*  whatsoever.
*  But that is not true.
*  And he has limited the congregational singing only for the psalm.
*  But the other than church, the outside of the church, he has helped some quite much
*  cultural activity, for example, publish of the psalm thing or arrangements and so on.
*  So that's he was also helpful to to inspire the musical activity in this world.
*  So I think in this way, we can evaluate the older musical or whatever cultural activity
*  in this world.
*  The other kind of under the very big notion of the general grace of the God.
*  So when Bach is in curtain in what is what was East Germany, which was Calvinist at the
*  time, but he's composing mainly secular works.
*  How do you frame that?
*  Why did he do that?
*  Oh, that's that he didn't have a chance to compose any Lutheran cantata at the time.
*  So he was really well, he from from one side, he must have been very happy to compose the
*  organ works, instrumental works and also secular cantatas and so on.
*  But probably he wished to do more work to the Lutheran world, Lutheran church and so
*  on. That's why he moved to Leipzig, I think.
*  So let's go back and just talk about your career, your history a bit.
*  So you're 12 years old and all of a sudden you hear Carl Richter's recording of Bach's
*  B Minor Mass.
*  Yeah.
*  How did you come upon that and how did you feel at the time?
*  Well, that was really, yeah, that's a little stupid.
*  But to the well, I was very, very excited, not only with that music, but also I got the
*  quite big stereo equipment from my father.
*  And then I was very excited to listen to whatever with the headphone.
*  Headphone was also very first experience.
*  And anyway, the B Minor Mass was so fantastic, so wonderful, but I didn't understand
*  anything from the text or from the music.
*  The music was much too complicated.
*  And the only thing is I played quite much trumpet in the brass band.
*  So that's why the trumpet playing by the German trumpeter, the Adolf Scherbam, that
*  was really fascinating in the B Minor Mass.
*  So I actually repeatedly listened to the only Gloria.
*  And so, yeah, but anyway, that B Minor Mass is really the wonderful encounter with Bach's
*  music.
*  And how was your musical ear back then?
*  So the Richter recording, I think of it as a little bit a mix of overblown and stiff,
*  even though it's pretty good, right?
*  No, it's not what people would listen to now.
*  Did you have a sense of that back then?
*  And you or you just blown away?
*  No, no, no.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, for other interviews, I have listened back to that recording recently.
*  And that was completely different.
*  And well, it is not acceptable at all for my ears because he was a character must have
*  been a really wonderful musician.
*  And also he played the harpsichord by himself and by the conducting, for example, for Saint
*  Mashi Passion without seeing any scores.
*  That's a really amazing thing.
*  But anyway, that's his way of music making is the well, completely modern, not only
*  modern, but the kind of the kind of the machine like the notes by notes.
*  That is really not acceptable anymore.
*  But at that time, that made probably a lot of excitement for the audience.
*  And that's very nice, I think.
*  Do you think there are any older recordings of Bach, say of the B minor mass or the
*  passions that have held up before the Dutch movement for original instruments?
*  Yeah, well, I listened to the, for example, the Mengelberg, Saint Mashi Passion a
*  couple of times, just as an example.
*  That's a very famous example in history.
*  And I think, yeah, well, that is of course completely different, but probably at that
*  time, it was very beautiful performance, I think.
*  And that is quite romantic.
*  Tempo is completely slow.
*  But, well, I have no idea how it was accepted, but actually it did work out at that time.
*  So this kind of sense of value about the performance is changing all the time.
*  So I think we belong to the quite different generation, but at that time, it must have
*  been very rightful and very stimulating to do the Bach music.
*  And how was it you decided to study early music in the Netherlands?
*  Was it just you wanted to study music and then you learn of the movement or you went
*  there because of the movement?
*  No, no, actually in this way, I was completely fascinated by the organ itself.
*  So that's why I started playing organ and I got the lessons when I was a teenager
*  before the university time.
*  And then I wanted to study more organ.
*  And my first organ teacher was a Belgian priest actually in Osaka.
*  And I told him that I wanted to be an organist.
*  And so, but listen, Masaki, there is no good organ in Japan at all.
*  So that is no good idea to study organ here in Japan.
*  So why don't you start to study composition?
*  So I did study composition and in the university.
*  That was very good.
*  The career, very good process to understand the music.
*  And in between, I just happened to meet the harpsichordist called Motoko
*  Nabeshima, Japanese, the kind of first generation harpsichordist who studied
*  with Gustav Levenholt in Amsterdam.
*  And she was really a genius person.
*  She spoke more than six languages in Europe and she has spent quite a long time in Europe.
*  And she came back to Japan and I met her and I got a lesson from her.
*  And that was really the kind of, how do you call it, the really changed my life.
*  And she introduced me to Tom Koopman, who was the schoolmates of her.
*  So they were together in Gustav Levenholt's class.
*  So I went to Amsterdam and I went to the Tom Koopman concert on the day of my arrival.
*  And that was really shocking.
*  It was so fresh and so exciting.
*  So I decided to come to Amsterdam and that was a very good decision.
*  I thought.
*  So if you started with organ, harpsichord, how was it then you came to conducting?
*  Conducting is actually, has been always outside of my idea because, you know, when you perform
*  cantatas or whatever Bach's ensemble music, you know, someone must lead the very possible
*  from the harpsichord as Bach did and so on.
*  So I did in that way.
*  So gradually I made some ensemble with my brother and my brother's colleague and the
*  string players and so on.
*  And then we were simply starting to perform the cantatas one by one.
*  And I, for example, I gave them some sign or some signature.
*  So my brother criticized what I mean.
*  Oh, that is not clear.
*  That is other.
*  Which tempo do you want?
*  Something like that.
*  So only through this kind of discussion, you know, I became a conductor.
*  I'm not the conductor.
*  Well, you're in a really traditional sense.
*  And were people telling you, well, you can only do one thing.
*  It's organ, harpsichord or conducting.
*  You have to choose one or everyone just let you do all of those.
*  Actually, these three are completely, I think that is integrated.
*  They're easily integrated.
*  But you do all three, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, yeah.
*  But harpsichord, organ is, for example, there's a completely different instrument,
*  but still based on the same idea how to make music and also conducting, choir
*  conducting especially, you know, there's exactly the same feeling as you play the
*  fuga on organ.
*  For example, theme comes now tenor, now soprano and something like that.
*  So that's exactly the same.
*  So only thing the choir has a text.
*  So that's much more, you know, better than organ, I think.
*  Given how much music you've produced and how consistent the quality is, what is it
*  you think you know about productivity that other people do not?
*  Well, I have no idea about other people's, but to the world, productivity,
*  well, that is only, well, the Bach's music is so fascinating.
*  So I can't stop working.
*  Simply.
*  So, well, well, yeah, yeah.
*  Well, I never tried to be productive.
*  Just the only I want to pursue the how to improve our performance, how to realize
*  this and that the music of Bach and not only Bach, but to the, so that is only
*  music is there, so nothing else.
*  If you had to explain, what is it about the music of Bach that you still do not
*  understand, what would that be?
*  Well, Bach's music has always together with some kind of puzzles and the enigma.
*  So that you can never get an answer to all the older, that kind of unknown
*  aspects of the Bach, for example, Kostya Fuga, for example, the art of few, for
*  example, we don't know why he has really written or why, what kind of situation
*  it was not finished.
*  And, and in the cantatas, for example, there are plenty of very difficult places
*  to, to understand why he did in this, this way and so on.
*  And the, most of the cases we can find some answers from the texts, but the
*  still it is not so easy to understand everything.
*  And that was very good.
*  How good a sense of the grasp of Bach's mind do you feel you have?
*  Or is he just a complete mystery to you?
*  Yeah, quite, quite much mysterious field, I think.
*  So I'm trying to understand and I'm trying to come closer to Bach's sense or
*  Bach's mind, but actually it is very, very difficult.
*  The, the, the more you work, the more distant you can get.
*  Yes, that's true.
*  When you're hiring for the Bach Collegium Japan, of course, they have to be
*  wonderful musicians, but given the extreme productivity demands that will be placed
*  on them, what is it you look for in the people you hire?
*  Well, the most important aspect from musicians is probably how much they can
*  devote to the music and sometimes how much interest they have in that music.
*  And so, well, I do, for example, singers auditions very often and well, of course
*  I can, I have to judge sometimes, you know, technical aspects of how good or
*  the technical, but not only the techniques, the most important thing is
*  the probably their interest and their, how much they can devote themselves to music.
*  And so, yeah, and yes, that is the most important thing.
*  So I'm very happy to have now our members and orchestra and singers and they, but
*  they, at the very beginning, they didn't have any idea what is the Bach's
*  cantata especially and the choir, the choral music or the, this kind of
*  ensemble music, how to do that.
*  But the in between during our working together, they have developed a lot.
*  So that was very nice.
*  And they inspired me again.
*  So this kind of vice versa, the inspiration is very, very nice.
*  Do you think Japanese players understand Bach differently?
*  I don't think so, but only thing is the basically Japanese people don't have any
*  Christian background or tradition in the country.
*  So I, sometimes I have to explain what the text says and so on.
*  And also this and that text comes from this and that text of the Bible and so on.
*  But the, this kind of explanation is not possible in Europe, for example, because
*  everything is already taken for granted.
*  So that's no one can really explain about the Jesus parables.
*  And so in Japan, I think it's very good to have that kind of a chance, you
*  know, to talk about that things.
*  And also the German text is of course, basically impossible in Japan to
*  understand immediately, but that's why we need the translations or we provide all
*  the time Japanese translations to audience and also for the orchestra people, all the
*  musicians and, but this kind of translation work is the part of very important
*  interpretation work because, you know, we read the Bible, for example, the only
*  through the translations, no one in this world, you know, reads the original
*  language in Old Testament, New Testament.
*  So, so actually, you know, to make us some, this kind of translations, you know, we
*  have to think on that or consider what it really means and so on all the time.
*  So I try to make quite some translations of Bach's concertos, some 20, 30
*  concertos I have translated myself, but it's very time consuming.
*  That's why I gave up the recently, but we have very good colleagues to
*  make good translations.
*  So with your Japanese background, do you think you approach Christianity differently?
*  I think so quite different from any other idea.
*  Well, actually, each of the countries have different traditional, different
*  approach to Christianity or whatever religion, I think.
*  But in Japan is quite different from Korea, for example, in Korea, there's
*  much more Christians now.
*  It is said that 40 or 50% of the population is Christian, but in
*  Japan it's always says that the only 1% of something.
*  But in spite of that, the Christian culture is very well known in Japan.
*  So everyone knows what Christmas is and even Easter, they did quite known
*  nowadays, but there's very, not so many Christians in Japan.
*  And I thought formally that that is a big, big negative aspect, but I think
*  that it's not possible really to count who is a Christian, who is not Christian.
*  And when we perform the St. Matthew Passion regularly on Holy Week, every
*  year, since 20 years we are doing.
*  And for now, we have regularly three performances in Holy Week in the same
*  venue, so something like 5,000, 6,000 people are coming for that performance.
*  And that is amazing thing in comparison with the number of the
*  Christianity in Japan.
*  So actually, I think that quite many people can appreciate that kind of
*  message from the Bible as well, not only the Bach's music, but from Bible and so on.
*  So that is my hope.
*  Do you ever think back on what is called the Christian century in Japan, which
*  ends, I think, in 1639, when a lot of Japanese convert to Christianity fairly
*  rapidly, but then Christianity is suppressed?
*  Is there some alternate history where Japan becomes more or less a Christian
*  country, or could that never have happened?
*  No, that has never happened.
*  That is completely stopped, I think, tradition-wise.
*  But it's very interesting that there are quite many evidence that before 1639,
*  quite many churches were built by the missionaries from Europe.
*  And also in Auzuchi, for example, where the Oda Nobunaga has a base,
*  very close to Kyoto, that was quite many churches and also quite some organs at
*  that time.
*  So, and also boys missionaries were sent twice, at least from Japan to the pope in
*  Rome, and in between, Atatami took a couple of years to reach Europe, and in
*  between, some of them practiced organ on the ship.
*  And then when they arrived at Evora in Portugal, one of them could play organ
*  immediately, and everyone was astonished.
*  But this kind of connection was completely stopped afterwards.
*  That was very pity.
*  And Christianity was actually left over only as the hidden Christian.
*  So that was a very interesting history, but probably it is not possible to
*  to call them Christianity anymore.
*  But that is a kind of mix up with Buddhism.
*  So the recently passed away, the musicologist, Mr. Minagawa, Tatsu
*  Minagawa, who has researched about dot history and found out a very interesting
*  thing.
*  Like, for example, there are still hidden Christians in Japan, in Kyushu area.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And I heard that they used to have the funeral ceremony combined with Buddhism
*  and Christianity.
*  So there are the kind of double, how do you call it, quite big houses or temple
*  like buildings.
*  And in the front side, they do the funeral ceremony according to the
*  Buddhism, Buddhist way.
*  And then in between the priests are supposed to walk around back to the
*  building.
*  And then while walking, they are all murmuring, this is not true.
*  This is not true.
*  This is not true.
*  And then come back to the Buddhism again, something like that.
*  So this is a really interesting ceremony.
*  So there's a kind of mixture with Christians.
*  And so this kind of hidden Christianity, or the Christian people, have a very,
*  very difficult and miserable history because they were completely depressed
*  and also they tortured many people.
*  And, but still they have survived in a way.
*  So that's, but not really anymore as Christian, the proper Christian.
*  Well, I don't know exactly.
*  Well, I can't, I can't tell too much about that, but because I don't know
*  exactly, but the anyway, that's a hidden Christianity is still there.
*  That's very interesting.
*  And you're from Kobe, right?
*  That was originally a Christian center along with Nagasaki because they were
*  port cities.
*  Is that why?
*  Yeah.
*  That is Kobe is one of the most important.
*  After, after the reopening of the Japan, so 1868, they are probably too Kobe
*  and the Yokohama and even Sendai those, the port places, you know, this is very
*  important to accept the, any kind of culture from outside, but the Christianity
*  came in and, and for example, there is the oldest protestant, the protestant
*  church is in, in Yokohama.
*  So, uh, that is, that is the end of 19th century.
*  That's a really interesting history.
*  How did Japanese audiences for classical music say in Tokyo differ from
*  New York audiences?
*  Well, probably a little different.
*  American audience are more friendly, more friendly and more easier to, to
*  excite, to, to be excited by the performance and as if they look like a
*  more inspired directly from the music and also musicians.
*  And in Japan, Japanese audiences, they, sometimes they, they know very well
*  about the repertory and, and very cooperative, but they at the same time,
*  the, a little bit, well, not, not so excited immediately.
*  Probably the inside is very excited, but well, we Japanese people don't express
*  directly from the, from inside to outside.
*  That is, uh, we all, we were all told in the school, for example, that is
*  rude, that is not the intellectual demeanor, something like that.
*  What do you think of the hypothesis, the Japanese audiences, they have a
*  special interest in iconic works such as Beethoven's Ninth, and there's an
*  insistence that they hear the best or experience the best and single out very
*  particular things.
*  Do you think that's true?
*  Yeah, Beethoven's Ninth is very special being here, and especially in December.
*  And so there are more than a hundred performances in Beethoven's Ninth,
*  only in December.
*  And the chorus at the end has special meaning for Japanese people, do you think?
*  Chorus?
*  The chorus, the lyrics to the chorus ending of the Ninth.
*  Yeah, that's of course, that is very special meaning, not only for Japan,
*  but I think that's a musical, it's a very big event.
*  And, but in Japan, there are quite some of the projects who gather the people,
*  more than 10,000 people to sing out the Beethoven Ninth at the end.
*  So that is quite a beloved event, but that is no more musical event, I don't think.
*  Why do you think Bach's larger vocal works were neglected for as long as they
*  were until Mendelssohn, right?
*  In what, the 1820s?
*  They're a bit forgotten.
*  The keyboard music is not forgotten.
*  What happened there?
*  Well, I don't know, there are a couple of different aspects.
*  For example, the passion music of Bach, the St.
*  Maschio-Osen-Chan, you need definitely a continual playing, for example,
*  but that idea was already distinct, already completely extinct by the time of Mendelssohn.
*  So Mendelssohn has reformed or made harmonization for the continual part.
*  He has performed some cantatas as well, but he always provided the parts for the brass
*  section or the wind section to fulfill the harmonization on the continual.
*  So that's the improvisation, improvisative parts of the continual could not
*  understood anymore by the time of Mendelssohn.
*  And also it was much easier for them to understand the passion music just as the
*  storytelling, so that Mendelssohn has performed St.
*  Maschio-Persian only mainly the older recitatives.
*  So he avoided for his first performance, he avoided the nearly all the arias, even
*  Aus Liebe, that's why he didn't perform the first time.
*  And his intention was to follow the story as directly as possible.
*  So in that way, probably it was thought just like the opera production.
*  So the Mendelssohn was indeed that revived the St.
*  Maschio-Persian, but actually that performance is completely different to what we are now doing.
*  How many times do you think Bach heard his own larger scale masterworks, St.
*  Matthew's Passion, B Minor Mass?
*  No, there is no evidence that he has performed B Minor Mass.
*  But he never heard it?
*  He never heard it.
*  Only in his mind.
*  Yeah.
*  And St. Maschio-Persian, he has performed at least three times, I think.
*  St. John is four times, or five, I'm not sure.
*  But anyway, that's only a couple of times he has really hard and performed his own
*  masterworks.
*  Now your music is largely online.
*  Not all of our listeners are experts in the music of Bach.
*  But if you had to recommend two or three cantaatas that you've conducted, a place
*  for them to start, where would you send them?
*  That is very difficult.
*  One of the most difficult questions.
*  Well, that depends on the situation, what you have in the past, in the experience.
*  But from my side, one of my favorite cantaatas is, for example, let me see.
*  Bach et aufe 140.
*  That's a very good one, of course.
*  And?
*  And Festerberg?
*  80.
*  St. Sarkat?
*  Well, I don't recommend that for the first beginner, because that is too complicated.
*  And, and, well, for example, cantaata number eight, Lipster Jesu, that is a really
*  wonderful music, so that you can really use it as a BGM background music as well.
*  And that is really comfortable to listen.
*  And, or the cantaata 102, the Herr Dine Augenzee and Dine Glaubens.
*  That is 102, that's a very interesting structure.
*  The choir has two double fugas, and that is a really interesting structure.
*  And also the aria was very dramatic.
*  So, or, well, otherwise plenty of examples.
*  In the world today, how many top-tier organs are there for playing the music of Bach?
*  Where you can really do it justice?
*  You said there were no good organs in Japan, or you were told this?
*  At that time, yes, yes.
*  How many organs of the highest quality are there in the whole world for you to play Bach?
*  In the whole world?
*  Yeah, how many?
*  That's a really difficult question, but it totally depends on what you think
*  beautiful or what you feel good.
*  Because I prefer personally the historical organs, the original organs, like in
*  Northern Germany or France or wherever.
*  And, well, my really favorite organ in the world is the Groningen, that is
*  the Martinikerk, that is built by the Johann Kaspar Schnitzka.
*  And where is that exactly?
*  The Groningen is in the north part of the Groningen.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And that is really wonderfully restored.
*  So that is quite much depends on how it's restored as well, because the organ is
*  had all very long history.
*  So in between, for example, in the 19th century, all of the historical organs were
*  once renovated according to the musical taste of that time.
*  So that's all the nearly old organs were once the romanticized, the
*  complete romantic way, they changed.
*  So the 20th century, most of the organs were re-renovated to bring them back to
*  the original situation or 18th century or 17th century.
*  And so how to restore is a really key point, actually.
*  So for example, this Martinikerk in Groningen organ, that is the
*  the, that originated the Schnitzka organ.
*  So the original from the very original style is very, very good, but that is
*  beautifully restored by JÃ¼rgen Ahlendt, one of the most important organ builder
*  in Germany.
*  And how was it that organs improved in the time of Baroque music and Bach so
*  that he could do what he did?
*  Because it wouldn't have been possible a hundred years earlier, right?
*  Yeah, the organ building have been all the time so changing according to the time.
*  And so Bach's time, the second half of the 18th century, the organs around Bach's
*  area, so Sachsen and TÃ¼dingen have quite different character from North and
*  Germany or Italy or France and so on.
*  And they had quite many stringy stops, registers, stringy sound, to quite with
*  that contains a lot of high overtones.
*  And that is very close to the string instruments.
*  And that is very, very interesting.
*  So that kind of character is very important for the Bach's organ music, I think,
*  basically.
*  And, but the Bach's, as I said, there is no organ extent from that time to play
*  all the Bach's organ music on one instrument.
*  So, actually Bach's idea of composition is always surpassed the organ situation.
*  Here's a question from a reader, quote, how does he explain the, to me,
*  surprisingly large number of Japanese organ students at top conservatories in
*  Europe?
*  Nowadays, so many, not so many Japanese.
*  Not so many, you think?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Now much more Korean organists.
*  Korean.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, basically, I think nowadays in Europe, much less numbers of Japanese
*  students in, in, in, in, in generally speaking.
*  And, but to the, for the, for such a, you know, there's a famous conservatory like
*  Paris or Rome or Vienna and so on.
*  There are still quite, quite some, I think, but much less than before.
*  And that was probably because the old Japanese musicians can get job now in
*  Japan, so they don't have to really go to the Europe anymore, in terms of getting
*  job, but I think it's still very important to go, go on to, to live in Europe once.
*  If you would like to be, to, to be the musician of the European music.
*  So it's very important, I think.
*  Once you arrived in the Netherlands, of course you've been to Germany many
*  times earlier on, how did that change?
*  How you understood the music of Bach?
*  Uh, well, before I came to the Netherlands, actually, I didn't have any knowledge.
*  I didn't have any understanding.
*  So only the, the feeling and I loved organ and I loved harpsichord and, uh, but
*  the only thing is the, when I, when I started learning with, with Tom
*  Kopman, you know, what I had done in Japan was not wrong.
*  So that's why I thought that I was very lucky, I thought.
*  And, but, uh, so firstly, uh, well, well, actually I was, uh, completely ignorant
*  before, before I came to the Netherlands about Baroque music or about Bach and
*  whatsoever, and the, so the, everything was so new to me.
*  So the, all the knowledge, Tom Kopman had so many books and so much
*  knowledge and he really, uh, you know, talked many things like machine guns.
*  Well, but the, after that, um, well, I learned and read some books and so on,
*  a little bit more objectively.
*  Then, um, uh, I came to the conclusion that I, uh, I, I'm good.
*  I'm, I'm, I can say myself, you know, something like that.
*  But if you go to the Bach church in Leipzig or go to Arnstadt mentally,
*  emotionally, does something fall into place or do you just look at it
*  and say, oh, that's nice?
*  Well, um, for example, in St.
*  Thomas church in Leipzig, uh, the, uh, I was very happy to be there.
*  The, uh, for the first time ever, that was still the, the air
*  side, the, the air time.
*  And, uh, it was really the, in front of the church, there were huge statue of the Bach.
*  And that was so big, but actually the, the, the St.
*  Thomas church itself is the, um, well, now there's quite, uh, how does it, that,
*  that is the, the inside is quite different from the time of the Bach and the, the,
*  uh, well, I was very happy to be there, but not really, you know, see, uh, how
*  they call it, the, I can't make any, any connection from the heaven through that
*  church, you know, that's also anyway, that's, um, the Bach can be anywhere.
*  I think I thought that the Bach can be anywhere in the world.
*  So that is very important places.
*  And, but now, uh, it's quite different to the building where structure was, and
*  the, everything is different.
*  So, uh, you can never feel the original atmosphere there.
*  What do you think of Glenn Gould's highly unusual interpretations of Bach?
*  Well, the Glenn Gould, I love the Glenn Gould performance very much.
*  And the, uh, that, that is not, not so unusual.
*  That's, uh, if you try to, um, to make articulations and also to make, uh, the,
*  some kind of effects, like, uh, the harpsichord and organ and so on, the, the, it,
*  I thought this is quite natural conclusion that he did in that way.
*  And, uh, uh, like, uh, and, uh, the, there's one or one or two, the
*  recording of organ playing, his organ playing, that was a little strange.
*  But piano, the, for example, Goldberg variation, that's a really
*  fabulous recording, I think.
*  What do you think of the view that some of them are wonderful, like the
*  partitas, the English, sweet and a minor, but say the well-tempered
*  clavier, it just seems like swooning and the tempos are too arbitrary.
*  It's not charming to me or...
*  Some of them seem to not work at all.
*  Yeah, could be.
*  I don't know so many different recordings, but the, at least for the
*  Glenn, the Goldberg variations, that was very nice, first one, especially.
*  Yeah.
*  And sometimes the tempo is very quick and I can't do that in that way, but
*  that's a very fascinating performance.
*  I think.
*  The Brandenburg concerti, what is it exactly that makes them such a major
*  advance over the music that came before?
*  Because they seem to come out of nowhere and they're so fully blown.
*  The solos are incredible, right?
*  The ensemble work.
*  Yes.
*  I think that was the intention to compile the six concertos as a one
*  collection, but probably by then he has composed quite many concertos.
*  We, the, and I think that is very simple.
*  Call the, you know, the New Yorker Bach specialist, Michael Morrison has
*  written about that Brandenburg concerto.
*  That was a symbolized symbol.
*  He, his intention was to represent the social hierarchy.
*  To the number one, Brandenburg number one is the, with two horns.
*  That is very, you know, the usual symbol for the court, the dignity of the court.
*  And then second one is the trumpet solo, oboe, recorder, and violin.
*  Those four instruments are supposed to be performed by any Stuttpfeiffer.
*  So they had to master all these instruments and so on and so on.
*  And the number three is very interesting.
*  But the number three is, this number was made by Bach himself.
*  And that is three violins, three violas, three cellos.
*  So that's everything dominated by three.
*  But the, the, he didn't compose a second movement.
*  So that is actually movement was supposed also three, but the second one is missing
*  and only one bar in the middle of the page.
*  So he clearly intended to, to, for him by himself, to improvise that, the second movement.
*  So the, that was the intention for the Berlin, the, the, the kind of the, how do you call it?
*  Recruit the, he intended, he wanted to, to, to dedicate to the Berlin graph.
*  And then, and then if you hire me, then I can improvise for this movement and something like that.
*  What is it in contemporary classical music that you enjoy?
*  Contemporary music.
*  Well, yes, I enjoy sometimes, but probably there are plenty of other specialists for that kind of contemporary music, I think.
*  But what do you listen to?
*  Well, the, I don't know what is the contemporary, but the probably I, I listened to Stravinsky, for example.
*  That's one of the, my favorite composer.
*  And I did actually, I made even one CD of the Prusinella and so on.
*  And the even more recent one like Takemitsu and that is very beautiful.
*  And so, but sometimes I can't understand what their intention.
*  So sometimes a very difficult, very recently I was, I used to be that
*  the student for the composition.
*  And at that time my teacher was Akio Yashiro, who has studied in Paris.
*  And he has passed away when he was the 46 years old, that really, while still I was a student at that time.
*  But he has composed a wonderful symphony and the piano concerti and so on.
*  And very recently I have performed his symphony for the first time in my life and with the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra.
*  And that was great, great pleasure.
*  And the rhythm call is so interesting.
*  And so, but structure is quite classical.
*  So his way of composing was in a way conservative, the, according to the very classical structure and also rhythm pattern and so on.
*  And they, but the sound itself is completely, well, new, I mean, art tonal music.
*  So it was a little difficult for me to enjoy that kind of sound.
*  So, but it was wonderful, well, wonderful experience.
*  What is it you like in popular music?
*  Popular music, I, again, I don't know what kind of definition of the popular music.
*  But the, well, I like some, the songs, singers, like Mariah Carey, for example, and also the Whitney Houston and so on, those things.
*  That's a really wonderful music.
*  And so they are really good, you know, singers.
*  And those are so kind of the, the texts are also very kind of to, to how, to cheer up the people.
*  And that was very positive aspect all the time.
*  So that was very, very nice.
*  And they, sometimes in Japanese, popular music is the, we, we call them the, one of the traditional, traditional Japanese popular music called Enka.
*  Enka means that is the songs for the remorse and also the sometimes regret and so on.
*  They all the time, very often Japanese popular songs have that kind of text which describes the negative aspects of our experience.
*  I find it's a little difficult, not difficult, I'm, they're a little pity.
*  What's your favorite Beatles song?
*  Beatles.
*  Beatles.
*  Yeah, Beatles.
*  Beatles.
*  I don't know much about that.
*  Yeah, that's Beatles really, I don't know.
*  But the, I, when I was a brass band, you know, we played some Beatles arrangement for brass band and that was the, that was the Yellow Submarine.
*  And yeah, one of, one of the Beatles songs, which was the, had a very top, the piccolo trumpet was the, as a feature.
*  Penny Lane, right?
*  Penny Lane, yes.
*  That's very good.
*  That is my favorite.
*  When you're conducting and recording, what is it you're thinking about?
*  Do you have to concentrate completely on the music or does your mind wander at all or how is that for you?
*  No, not at all, not at all.
*  I, I, well, basically I can't think anything other than, other than music.
*  Then what is happening?
*  Yeah, that happened in that bar.
*  And so even I can't think of the next bar.
*  So the only thing that I always concentrate in what coming next, what coming next, something like that.
*  And the, and also the, the purpose or aim of that, that part of the music.
*  So, you know, what kind of atmosphere must be realized and so on.
*  That is most important things.
*  And you're never distracted by physical troubles, like I'm tired of standing or anything?
*  Well, no, actually no distraction only for the rehearsals.
*  You know, when I start rehearsals, sometimes I feel today's I was very tired, but, but during the rehearsal, I always fresh up.
*  So that's no problem anymore.
*  That's the during the, because of the music, you know, I always, I can get energy from that.
*  How much do you need a score to conduct?
*  How much?
*  Well, some people conduct without a score.
*  It's much harder.
*  Or do you need a score or you use a score?
*  You don't.
*  Oh yeah, of course.
*  Definitely.
*  I always use the score.
*  I never, never do anything by heart because that is not necessary.
*  And it just takes up more brain power for no purpose.
*  No, actually the, you know, the, for pianist or violinist or song singers, for example, there's a day, maybe they must
*  memorize all the texts or whatever.
*  And for pianist, they, most of the pianists are too busy, you know, to see the score.
*  So that's a day, of course, must memorize everything.
*  But for conductors, there's no reason to memorize actually.
*  So just like Anselme said, you know, and I think the, and also choir, choir people in the, of the sacred music, not, not in the
*  opera scene whatsoever, but they must keep the scores always in hand because, you know, there's by, by memorization, you know,
*  just the, the, your memory, the music, how do you call it, your understanding of the music are changing all the time.
*  Because, you know, to, to, to realize this and that notes and the texts and so on, without mistakes and so on, then you must
*  take different energy to keep up that.
*  But what we should do is only to make music, to make a sound.
*  So I think the, other than the opera's, scenar, scenery performances, the, I think it is better to have those scores all time.
*  Do you just go back and listen to your old recordings for fun or it's finished, you're done and you move on to the next thing?
*  Yeah, basically I want always to move on to the next and never look back.
*  But sometimes I was told to do that because I have to choose the content of this and that thing
*  to make another program or to make a recommendation of the content and so on.
*  But basically I don't look back at all.
*  But you have, say, at least two recordings of Saint Matthew's Passion.
*  I think they're about 10 years apart.
*  Yeah.
*  So when you did the second, was your feeling, I just want to do something different?
*  Or you had heard the first and you thought, no, that's wrong.
*  I need to correct it.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  They're just different visions.
*  That was only, you know, each CD, each recording, and never,
*  never none of them was really perfect.
*  So I always want to do once again, like the live performance.
*  So if I have a time, you know, I'd like to do all the contours once again.
*  But then the after all, then I probably will want to do once again.
*  So that's why there's a never ending story.
*  But for Saint Matthew Passion, the first recording was the, I have nothing to regret,
*  but the in between we have the much better, we have improved in,
*  in not only the technically, but also the understanding of the Bach
*  and all the members, choir member, orchestra member have all developed quite much.
*  So that's why kind of as a milestone, you know, I think there's the very good to do once again.
*  And if I could live another 30 years and then probably I will do once again.
*  You have one of the best known recordings of Handel's Messiah.
*  But as you know, there's literally hundreds of recordings of the Messiah.
*  Do you go and listen to some of them before you record
*  to make sure yours is different or you just figure it will come out different?
*  Do you listen to old ones like Beecham for inspiration or how do you approach the musical pass?
*  That is the, sometimes I need to, you know, to listen to the others,
*  recording of the older one or the other kind of reference.
*  But basically I don't listen to, I'm trying not to listen too much.
*  That was too much influence.
*  And I think the make recording is very interesting because that is a
*  quite important experience for all of us, all of our colleagues.
*  And during the recording session, you know, many things happen and not always very easy.
*  And so, but during that recording sessions, you know, we all take that music into any
*  cells in our body.
*  That is really interesting.
*  And for example, that the Messiah recording is a long time ago, but during the recording session,
*  these couple of our colleagues, the mother or father or spouse, they have passed away or
*  something.
*  And also my wife, the mother, has passed away just when we finished the recording, as if
*  she has waited for that moment.
*  So that kind of memory is always coming back.
*  And so it's a really wonderful experience to keep going with the recording session.
*  Session recording, that's very nice.
*  As you must know, Apple has recently acquired BIS Records and you've done so much of your
*  work with them.
*  Will that change how you approach recording projects?
*  Well, actually, we don't know yet what's happening now.
*  So, well, I'm so happy to be working with BIS all the time since 30 years now.
*  So I really hope that we can go on in more or less a similar way and we have a really
*  wonderful connection, the relationship with this company.
*  So more people might hear your music because Apple will put it higher in the algorithm,
*  right?
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, let's say you're listening to music through Apple services and you just type in
*  Bach.
*  You don't know what you want.
*  I would think it's more likely that Apple puts you at the front because they own the
*  rights to that music and that more people will hear you.
*  I'm just guessing.
*  Yeah, yeah, maybe.
*  Yeah, maybe.
*  That is what I'll probably hopefully.
*  So it could be good for you.
*  Yeah, that's very nice.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're now a 67 years old and you first heard Bach when you were 12 years old.
*  That's 55 years of listening to Bach, playing it, conducting it, recording it.
*  Over so many years, how do you think it's affected you emotionally or spiritually or
*  philosophically?
*  How are you different internally?
*  Wow.
*  Well, I'm getting older now.
*  So the end of Bach is always there.
*  So, yeah, well, I've never thought in that way.
*  The Bach is my life, actually.
*  So, you know, so familiar.
*  And as if the real, I am living inside of the Bach's music.
*  So I can never judge from outside.
*  So, yeah, well, actually, it is not thinkable to live without Bach's music or without music.
*  And so that is my life only.
*  Last two questions.
*  First, what is your favorite pizza in New Haven?
*  Pizza?
*  Well, perfectly, to be honest, I didn't get any pizza.
*  It's very good there.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  That's very famous.
*  Yeah.
*  But, well, I don't like pizza so much.
*  Last question.
*  What will you do next?
*  Now?
*  Now?
*  Well, after this project with Yale and Juilliard, now we are rehearsing of the Handel's oratorio
*  called L'Allegro Pensollus et Moderato.
*  That's very interesting music.
*  But the after that, let me see.
*  Now next project is, well, a couple of organ concerts in Japan because the
*  the in Koba in the Schoen Chapel, where we have made all the CDs recording and that organ
*  that's built by the French organ builder called Marc Gardiner, that was exactly 40 years
*  Jubilee this year.
*  So that's why I will give a couple of concerts there.
*  So that is actually starting point of my whole career.
*  So that is really important events.
*  And after that, I'm coming back to Europe to make another volume six or seven days of
*  the organ series in Groningen.
*  And then I will make a tour with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with the Christmas
*  Oratorio, whole six parts.
*  So that's really exciting.
*  And the next year, January, we are going to perform Brahms' Toichorequiem with a
*  period instruments in Japan and to make a recording that's really exciting.
*  I look forward to that.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you very much.
