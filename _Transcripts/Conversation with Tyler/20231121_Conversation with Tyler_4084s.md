# Mark Zuckerberg Interviews Patrick Collison & Tyler on the Nature & Causes of Progress (BONUS) | CWT
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M)
*  Hi, it's Jeff, producer of Conversations with Tyler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=0.0s)]
*  In the spirit of Thanksgiving, we're bringing you another bonus episode. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=7.0s)]
*  This time, it's Mark Zuckerberg interviewing Tyler Cowen and Stripe CEO Patrick Collison [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=10.1s)]
*  about the need to better understand the nature and causes of progress. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=14.58s)]
*  This was the final interview in Mark's year-long series on technology and society, and you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=18.6s)]
*  can also find it on Mark's Facebook page. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=23.56s)]
*  So as you're sitting around the Thanksgiving table this week, take a tip from Tyler and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=26.12s)]
*  Patrick. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=29.58s)]
*  Instead of politics, talk about the paper from DuFlo and Banerjee that found coaching [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=30.58s)]
*  improved the effectiveness of foreign aid. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=34.46s)]
*  Or marvel at how we built the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge simultaneously in four years. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=36.9s)]
*  How fast did you get your Thanksgiving feast ready? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=41.86s)]
*  Enjoy! [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=44.54s)]
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=52.099999999999994s)]

*  Hey everyone, and welcome to the next in our series of discussions on the internet and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=79.98s)]
*  technology and progress and some of the social issues that we face. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=85.58s)]
*  We've done a number of these this year, focused on topics ranging from regulation to journalism [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=89.82s)]
*  to biomedical research. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=94.78s)]
*  And today we're going to focus on a discussion on what progress is itself and how we might [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=96.82s)]
*  study it and what academic work is already going on in this space and what we might think [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=103.9s)]
*  about to look at examples from the past to determine how we can make more progress for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=109.06s)]
*  humanity going forward. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=113.64s)]
*  So today joining me is Tyler Cowan, who studies economics at George Mason University and is [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=114.94s)]
*  also the co-author of the popular blog Marginal Revolution. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  And Patrick Collison, who's the co-founder and CEO of Stripe, which is a pretty amazing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=126.82s)]
*  company that basically does payments and economic infrastructure for the internet. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=132.32s)]
*  So we've been talking about these topics for a while now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=137.14s)]
*  I mean, this is something that you guys have both studied in a lot of depth. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=140.46s)]
*  And you recently wrote an op-ed together, I think it was in the Atlantic, about how [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=144.7s)]
*  we might have a new or different approach for studying the nature of progress in order [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=151.02s)]
*  to kind of mine historical examples to figure out how we can make more progress in the future. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=159.62s)]
*  So I think it would probably be interesting just to start off by hearing how you're thinking [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=164.34s)]
*  about that and the basic summary and what feedback you've gotten on the piece that you wrote. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=167.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=173.34s)]
*  So I think one of the most important sort of facts in the world and sort of the history [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=174.34s)]
*  of civilization to date is that the rate of progress has not been constant, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  If you look at sort of what happened in the world, say between zero and 1700, 1800, thereabouts, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=186.06s)]
*  by any major metric in terms of average income or average life expectancy or infant mortality, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=193.46s)]
*  any of these measures, it was either sort of constant or only very improving at a very [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=201.06s)]
*  slow rate, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=206.74s)]
*  And then something happened. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=208.06s)]
*  Something changed around sort of 1700, 1750, the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=209.06s)]
*  some sort of the advent of something approximating modern science. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=214.3s)]
*  Once that happened, so many things started to get better together, right? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=220.12s)]
*  Again, incomes improved, life expectancy increased. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=224.12s)]
*  We started to discover really fundamental knowledge about the world. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=227.24s)]
*  We started to invent really important new technologies and these things over the last [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=229.68s)]
*  couple of centuries really diffused around the world, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=233.36s)]
*  So that's very interesting and important. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  And the intuition, I think, and the thing that sort of really struck or has been sort [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=238.96s)]
*  of a focus of both of ours for the past couple of years is thinking about, well, we sort [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=245.52s)]
*  of transitioned from this regime where we weren't making much progress to one where [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=250.28s)]
*  we have been making much more. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=253.84s)]
*  Is this the best we can do, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=256.2s)]
*  Or is there something that looks, compared to the status quo today, so much better again [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=258.48s)]
*  that it's sort of like the status quo ex ante before the Industrial Revolution? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=263.42s)]
*  And as you look around the world today, on the one hand, we see the tremendous importance [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=267.68s)]
*  of the progress that we are generating, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=273.32s)]
*  And that, for example, the number of people in extreme poverty has declined by more than [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=275.68s)]
*  a billion people since I was born. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=280.16s)]
*  But on the other hand, there's a lot of suggestive evidence that maybe we aren't as effective [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=282.64s)]
*  at generating progress today as we have been in the past. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=287.36s)]
*  And so, for example, if you look at the US, productivity growth mid-century, or say between [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=291.16s)]
*  1920, 1970, was maybe about 1.9% a year. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=296.72s)]
*  Now most economists think it's much lower, maybe around 0.4% a year, something like that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=300.6s)]
*  So we're, at least by economic measures, generating progress more slowly than we used to be. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=305.16s)]
*  Now, whatever the rate at which we're making progress or figuring out ways to do things [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=309.96s)]
*  better today, whatever that absolute level is, it would be much better if we were doing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  it more effectively, if we were able to solve the most important problems that face us today [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=319.36s)]
*  in 50 years or 100 years rather than 500 years or 1,000 years, right? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=323.62s)]
*  And so the meta question that we're really interested in is how does progress happen? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=327.56s)]
*  How do we discover useful knowledge? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=332.04s)]
*  How is that diffused? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=334.16s)]
*  And how can we do it better? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=335.16s)]
*  It's important to understand, I think, how much this is an invisible crisis. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=336.6s)]
*  So if you have a growth rate that is one percentage point lower, over the course of a bit more [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=340.76s)]
*  than a century, you could have been three times richer with a higher growth rate. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=345.12s)]
*  That would be something like the difference between the United States today and Mexico. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=349.62s)]
*  So by having a lower rate of productivity growth, in no given year does it feel that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=354.26s)]
*  bad. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=358.18s)]
*  But two, three generations later, you're much worse off. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=359.18s)]
*  It's harder to pay off your debts, harder to solve climate change, harder to address [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=361.46s)]
*  a whole host of problems. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=366.46s)]
*  So before we kind of dive into how we could improve this, what do you say to the people [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=367.46s)]
*  who question whether all this progress is positive? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=372.38s)]
*  I mean, certainly, as we make progress in one area, it creates issues in other areas. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=375.98s)]
*  I mean, that's been a big topic that I focused on in my work at Facebook over the last few [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=380.86s)]
*  years and a lot of these challenge discussions. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=385.66s)]
*  But how does that fit into the overall framework of what you're studying in this discipline [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=388.7s)]
*  here? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, I don't think economic growth is always a positive, but the world and America [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  has serious problems. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=399.98s)]
*  I would rather address those problems with more resources rather than fewer, whether [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  our debts, addressing climate change, fixing global poverty, and knowledge matters too. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=407.1s)]
*  So there's a recent paper by Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, and they find if you [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=412.74s)]
*  give foreign aid combined with coaching, the rate of return to that intervention is maybe [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=416.74s)]
*  100 to 400%. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  That may or may not be true, but what I would like to see is a world where everyone is obsessing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=424.1s)]
*  over that claim, over that debate, working very hard to figure out that it's true. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=428.74s)]
*  That should be on the front page. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=432.94s)]
*  People should be talking about it, calling up their siblings, my goodness, I just read [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=434.56s)]
*  this. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=438.16s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=439.16s)]
*  Do you agree or not? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=440.16s)]
*  Yeah, and look, while again I think it's sort of unequivocally the case that certain kinds [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=441.16s)]
*  of progress in certain places or to a certain extent can have harms and externalities and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=444.88s)]
*  all the rest, and a really important part of progress is figuring out how do we mitigate [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=449.52s)]
*  those, how do we solve them, and so on. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=453.24s)]
*  I think climate change is probably the foremost global example today. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=454.6s)]
*  But I think it's really important, or it is easy for us sitting here in the Bay Area [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=457.16s)]
*  in California, I think, to undervalue the prosperity and the kind of wealth we've been [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=462.64s)]
*  able to generate over the past couple, again, 100 years. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=468.28s)]
*  Since I was born, for example, global life expectancy has increased by about six years, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  infant mortality has fallen by more than 50%. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  Again, I mentioned the statistic about the number of people who have left extreme poverty. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=481.28s)]
*  This is incredibly important, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=486.96s)]
*  And so I think we're not the first people to say it, but there is a moral imperative [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=488.44s)]
*  to this kind of progress, and we shouldn't lose sight of that fact. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=494.34s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=497.08s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=498.08s)]
*  A lot of these things are not uniform from running a company that when you look at averages [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=500.28s)]
*  and anything, it hides a lot of issues. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=506.4s)]
*  Your example on the rates of poverty going down I think is an interesting one in this [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=508.48s)]
*  because what a lot of people don't particularly want to talk about these days is that not [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=512.86s)]
*  most of the benefit of people coming out of poverty has happened in China, and a lot of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  other places around the world, in some places, poverty has actually increased. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=523.72s)]
*  So I generally agree with the premise, and I think studying this stuff will generally [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=528.52s)]
*  help us to make more progress in those places. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=533.88s)]
*  I mean, that may be a good example because perhaps looking at some of the examples of [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=536.04s)]
*  what has done well in China could be applied to other places where there have been issues. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=539.8s)]
*  But before we dive into the discussion on this, I just wanted to make sure that we didn't [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=545.2s)]
*  cover this in a way that comes across as if every step forward it comes without a cost. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=549.5200000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure as we talk through the different examples, that will come up as well. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=556.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and we should emphasize that when we talk about the phenomenon of progress, I think [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=560.6s)]
*  GDP or GDP per capita is a pretty good first approximation measure of it, and it correlates [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=565.6800000000001s)]
*  strongly with many of the things I think we care about. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  But they're definitely not the same thing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=575.24s)]
*  I think an important question for anybody interested in this area to think about is, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=576.52s)]
*  well, how should we define progress, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  And what are the better and worse kinds of it? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=586.24s)]
*  And again, in GDP, we kind of have a relatively effective metric we can use across countries, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=589.12s)]
*  but there already is interesting work on what might better measures be, and I think that's [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=595.12s)]
*  really important to study. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=599.9599999999999s)]
*  Let's say you want to improve the lot of people in West Virginia. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=601.12s)]
*  One growth enhancing way of doing that is to make it easier to build, say, in Washington, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=604.2s)]
*  D.C., in the Bay Area. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=608.4000000000001s)]
*  Right now, to move from West Virginia, say, to Menlo Park, it's extraordinarily expensive. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  You can't just pick up and show up here and hope to get a job washing dishes the way one [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=615.0400000000001s)]
*  might have done in America 50 years ago. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=619.0s)]
*  So by having more building, more economic growth, also more GDP, it would increase more [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  opportunity. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=626.52s)]
*  Economic growth and opportunity, they do tend to be correlated, and sometimes the problem [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  is we don't have enough growth, not that we have too much. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=631.68s)]
*  And look, not to hammer this point too strongly, but you did invite the two people who wrote [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  the piece about progress here. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=638.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I would say most of the time actually talking about that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=639.96s)]
*  I just wanted to make sure that we hit that up front. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=643.04s)]
*  So what are you, when you're talking about, you know, there are a lot of people who already [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=644.84s)]
*  are studying this in different ways, right? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=648.64s)]
*  There are historians, economists. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=650.36s)]
*  When you're thinking about what the field is, when you're talking about trying to create [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=652.76s)]
*  a new science of studying progress, what more do you think needs to get done, or what do [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=657.92s)]
*  you envision on that? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=662.76s)]
*  I mean, I know you have a fund that you've put together, Emerging Ventures. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=663.76s)]
*  Emerging Ventures, yes. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=668.08s)]
*  And where you're basically finding academics who are studying examples of where there's [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=669.08s)]
*  progress in the past to start this field. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=677.2s)]
*  But what does this kind of add up to? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=680.0400000000001s)]
*  What form does this take over time? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=682.72s)]
*  One view of mine is that not enough philanthropy is long-term oriented. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=684.4s)]
*  In this regard, I've been influenced by your Chan Zuckerberg initiative. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=688.36s)]
*  And also in philanthropy, there are too many choke points that can say no. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=692.2s)]
*  So foundations become their own bureaucracies. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=695.96s)]
*  They become very risk averse. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=698.1600000000001s)]
*  So Emerging Ventures is a new kind of philanthropy. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=700.08s)]
*  There's one layer of yes or no. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=702.76s)]
*  People are encouraged to apply. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=704.96s)]
*  If the payoff is 30, 40 years down the road, the attitude is great. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=706.56s)]
*  Take a lot of chances. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=710.2199999999999s)]
*  Worry about getting some winners and some risk and not expecting the median project [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=712.04s)]
*  to be something that necessarily looks good when taken to a board. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  So that's one way that thinking in terms of progress helps us restructure at the micro [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=719.8s)]
*  level particular decisions we're making. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=726.56s)]
*  I strongly agree that there's a lot of really important work already happening across multiple [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=727.56s)]
*  disciplines that is relevant to these questions. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=731.92s)]
*  And part of the idea of there being a new science of progress, that's not quite...that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=734.08s)]
*  was the headline placed on the article, but not exactly what we were saying. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=741.1600000000001s)]
*  What we're arguing is that the work that's already happening should be receiving more [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=746.12s)]
*  attention and there should be much more of it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  And just to give us a couple of quick examples, there is strongly suggestive evidence that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=751.12s)]
*  we can teach management practices such that people can run firms more effectively. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=757.12s)]
*  And so there's a couple of studies on this. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=762.36s)]
*  There's a good one from some folks at Stanford that did a randomized trial in India. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=764.08s)]
*  And there's a really neat one that came out I think last year from Michele Giorcelli looking [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=767.8000000000001s)]
*  at firms in Italy and showing that over 15 years after, again, a management training [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=773.1600000000001s)]
*  program with some natural randomization, that again, those firms were employing more people, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=778.84s)]
*  paying more wages, being more successful. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=784.6s)]
*  And another randomized trial in Mexico conducted over the past couple of years, again, 600 [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  firms, and showing that just teaching better management practices actually makes those [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=792.32s)]
*  companies much better off. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=795.4s)]
*  If that's true, that's amazing low-hanging fruit, right? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=797.16s)]
*  We should be investing much more in this area. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=799.44s)]
*  We should be figuring out which kinds of management training work better and worse than others, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=800.92s)]
*  as it's generalized to all countries, how can we actually implement and execute this [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=803.76s)]
*  in the world more broadly. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=806.64s)]
*  So that's kind of one. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=807.64s)]
*  Second is, if you take...you know, Tyler mentioned this point about sort of geographic mobility, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=808.64s)]
*  right? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=813.5600000000001s)]
*  When you think about sort of how do we grow GDP or how do we generate progress, maybe [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  kind of housing policy is not kind of the first thing we're naturally drawn to thinking [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=818.4s)]
*  about. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=821.24s)]
*  However, if you look at the world in, say, the USA in 1980, about 40% of people when [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=822.24s)]
*  they took a new job moved somewhere else, right? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=829.96s)]
*  Those things went together much more. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=832.48s)]
*  If you look last year, about one in 10 people moved when they took a new job, right? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=833.84s)]
*  And so within the US, geographic mobility really declined. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=837.2s)]
*  That is in large part because the costs of movement have enormously increased as housing [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=840.6800000000001s)]
*  costs have increased, especially in our most productive regions over the past couple of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=846.76s)]
*  decades. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=851.0s)]
*  Now, if you look into that sort of more closely, again, there are sort of economists who've [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=852.0s)]
*  been studying these questions, you know, quite closely over the past couple of years. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=854.52s)]
*  These two guys, Shay and Moretti published a paper, an updated version of a previous [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=858.56s)]
*  paper this summer, claiming or kind of putting forward a model showing that if you look at [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=862.64s)]
*  that existed in the Bay Area and New York between 1964 and 2009, and you kind of imagine [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=871.76s)]
*  a counterfactual world where there was sort of much more supply elasticity in these places. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=878.52s)]
*  We built way more homes here in the Bay Area and in New York. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=882.48s)]
*  In that counterfactual world, average US income would be in their model $3,700 per person [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=885.98s)]
*  higher. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=892.68s)]
*  Again, not just for people in those places, but across the country, right? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=893.68s)]
*  That's a huge effect size. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=896.52s)]
*  And so again, we should be studying these questions much more closely and we should [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=897.72s)]
*  be figuring out, okay, well, if that's true, what are the policy prescriptions? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  How do we actually go act upon that? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=904.52s)]
*  It's amazing, low-hanging fruit. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=905.64s)]
*  And then just to give a third one, as those two examples show, funding science is incredibly [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=907.5600000000001s)]
*  important, but there's surprisingly little work about how we should be funding science [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=912.28s)]
*  and how can we do that most effectively. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=916.12s)]
*  And actually, sort of beneath the surface, it's been changing a tremendous amount here [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=917.64s)]
*  in the US over the past couple of decades. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=922.08s)]
*  There are important policy questions. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=925.48s)]
*  Is that a good thing? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=927.72s)]
*  And so for example, in 1980, 12X more dollars, or the NIH spent 12X more dollars on researchers [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=928.72s)]
*  under 40 than researchers over 50. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=935.96s)]
*  So they predominantly funded younger people. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=938.0s)]
*  Today, they spend 5X more dollars on people over 50 than under 40. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=940.24s)]
*  And so it's really inverted. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=944.96s)]
*  It's kind of gone from primarily funding these young investigators to this kind of gerontocracy [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=945.96s)]
*  where they're funding older scientists. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=950.2s)]
*  Maybe that's good, maybe that's bad. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=952.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=953.88s)]
*  That seems like a very important question to answer. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=955.76s)]
*  And so part of our point in arguing for progress studies is when you really look at the kind [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=956.76s)]
*  of the expansive version of this, of all the different things that can sort of influence [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=960.2s)]
*  our ability to discover new useful knowledge to generate economic growth, the set of questions [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=965.04s)]
*  is super broad and we should be trying to kind of synthesize this effectively. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=970.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=973.2s)]
*  So let's go deep on medical research here for a second because this is an area that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=974.2s)]
*  you wrote this paper about before about how the progress in the field might be slowing. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=978.76s)]
*  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropy that I run with my wife, a big focus of it [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=984.32s)]
*  is on medical research and trying to... [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=990.24s)]
*  We have this aspirational goal that we want to help build tools that can help scientists [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=993.2s)]
*  cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of this century. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=998.0s)]
*  And basically the math of how you get there is starting about 100 years ago, call it, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1003.0s)]
*  there was really this uptick in medical research where we started doing randomized control [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1011.4s)]
*  experiments, treating it more like an experimental science. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1017.32s)]
*  Since around that time, the average life expectancy has increased by a quarter of a year every [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  year relatively linearly. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1025.24s)]
*  There's no guarantee of course that that continues, but if we're able to have that continue, then [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1028.92s)]
*  that would imply that by the end of the century, we will generally have had to have either [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1033.76s)]
*  cure, prevent, or be able to manage most, if not all of the diseases that we're aware [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1037.36s)]
*  of now. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1043.24s)]
*  So there's some trend that suggests that this should be reasonable. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1044.56s)]
*  And the approach that we're taking in the work at CZI is largely about building tools [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1047.8799999999999s)]
*  to help compound the rate of science. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1052.36s)]
*  So what we see is that, like you mentioned, the government is the largest and most important [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1055.3999999999999s)]
*  funder of science. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1061.72s)]
*  And it basically funds the whole establishment of scientists across the country. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1062.72s)]
*  But the grants tend to be very spread out across a lot of people. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1069.32s)]
*  They're not typically put into big infrastructure projects. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1075.24s)]
*  And that's the niche that we felt through CZI that we can maybe help to fill is investing [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1079.28s)]
*  a million dollars in a lab, put a hundred million dollars or a couple hundred million [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1086.92s)]
*  dollars over time into building up really important scientific assets for the community, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1092.68s)]
*  like helping to fund scientists to go put together this human cell atlas. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1097.52s)]
*  Almost like the...and kind of think about it as almost like the periodic table of elements, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  but for biology of all the different kinds of cells in the human body. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1106.1200000000001s)]
*  And the goal is just, if you look throughout the history of science at least, most major [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1110.24s)]
*  scientific breakthroughs have been preceded by the invention of new tools that help people [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1115.56s)]
*  look at things in different ways. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1118.92s)]
*  And so the theory is kind of similar to what you're going at of how do you increase the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1120.2s)]
*  compounding rate of progress. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1123.76s)]
*  But there are a couple of different directions that I think we could go in here. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1124.96s)]
*  And one is, I'm curious what you've seen in your studies in the space that suggest to [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1128.0s)]
*  you that the rate of progress is actually slowing. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1133.24s)]
*  And I'm also curious, what are the examples that you've seen overall of how the science [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1135.68s)]
*  around studying progress would potentially lead to a different approach or a different [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1142.12s)]
*  portfolio of how this kind of work gets done? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1146.52s)]
*  So I don't know where you want to start with that, but there's a lot here to do. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1149.1599999999999s)]
*  Here's what worries me, and it should worry you too. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1152.04s)]
*  So as you mentioned, US life expectancy is basically going up in linear fashion. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1154.08s)]
*  But if you look at expenditures, we used to spend a few percentage points of GDP on healthcare, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1158.9199999999998s)]
*  and now it's about 18%. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1164.0s)]
*  So we've gone up to 18%, and we're not even boosting the rate. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1165.8s)]
*  I'm not saying it's the fault of any one group of people, but something has gone wrong. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1169.56s)]
*  There's some kind of last mile problem. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1173.84s)]
*  You can turn to the newspapers and read all kinds of fantastic stories, new research, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1176.08s)]
*  new ideas, new tools. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1180.12s)]
*  But when the rubber hits the road, people living longer, we're spending more and more [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1181.92s)]
*  and more for exactly the same returns. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1186.04s)]
*  So if that trend continues, and you see a similar trend in many areas, also crop yields, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1188.6399999999999s)]
*  feeding the world, other areas, the question becomes, you know, where does all the progress [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1193.28s)]
*  go? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1198.68s)]
*  So the idea that you need to look at each structure and encourage more risk taking, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1199.68s)]
*  better decisions with the money, less bureaucratization, maybe in some cases more centralization, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1205.28s)]
*  whatever it takes, but that there is this invisible crisis, and people are distracted [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  by the headlines about CRISPR, whatever, but actually what you get for the money. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1213.92s)]
*  Performance is so-so, I think. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1219.68s)]
*  Yeah, and so what we wrote in this article a year ago about sort of what's going on [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1221.16s)]
*  in science, if you look at it by sort of the most kind of macroscopic measures, right, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1227.12s)]
*  like the number of PhDs in the US, like active PhDs has grown by, you know, actually, you [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1232.32s)]
*  take all the macroscopic measures, they've all grown by a factor between 50 and 100, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1237.0s)]
*  right? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  Number of PhDs, number of papers published every year, just like actual dollars into [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1242.3999999999999s)]
*  the science funding and so on. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1245.56s)]
*  So in a very stylized way, if you look at the first half of the 20th century as compared [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1246.6399999999999s)]
*  just like way more kind of input in the second half of the century. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1251.72s)]
*  And again, not by kind of 50% but by kind of orders of magnitude. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1257.3200000000002s)]
*  And so then I think the question for all of us would be, well, you know, in which half [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1261.3200000000002s)]
*  of the century did we get more out in terms of kind of useful scientific knowledge, you [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1265.3200000000002s)]
*  know, and whichever we think kind of did better, you know, to what degree, right? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1270.52s)]
*  And you know, again, this is a very difficult question to answer, you know, how do you weigh [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1274.8000000000002s)]
*  And so you have to kind of look at it, I think, in some various applied context, like life [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1279.16s)]
*  expectancy or semiconductors or, as Tyler mentioned, crop yields or, you know, whatever. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1282.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think what's interesting and, you know, should be concerning is that for almost every [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1289.0800000000002s)]
*  conceivable sort of applied measure, we seem to be getting, you know, at best, constant [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1292.76s)]
*  returns. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1298.0400000000002s)]
*  But that's really bad because, you know, we've exponentially increasing inputs and we've, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1299.0400000000002s)]
*  you know, constant return outputs. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1302.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think that is kind of almost by definition, it's not a process that we can sustain. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, you know, there's two, I think, broad possibilities there. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1308.24s)]
*  One is it's just getting intrinsically harder to generate progress and to kind of discover [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1311.2s)]
*  these things. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1314.68s)]
*  And, you know, who knows, maybe some significant amount of that is true. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1315.68s)]
*  But the other possibility is it's somehow more institutional, right? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  It's more kind of contingent. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1320.92s)]
*  It's more sociological. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1321.92s)]
*  And again, we do have suggestive evidence that, you know, our institutions, well, they're [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1322.92s)]
*  certainly kind of older than they used to be. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1327.68s)]
*  And they're also kind of, as in the kind of NIH funding example, there are, you know, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1330.0200000000002s)]
*  changes happening beneath the surface and so on that, you know, may or may not be good. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1333.8s)]
*  So I don't think we should write off the possibility that it's actually, you know, it's not inevitable [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1336.76s)]
*  and that there is or that there do exist alternate forms of organization where things would work [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1340.92s)]
*  better. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1345.48s)]
*  And again, if we sort of, you know, dig a little bit into the evidence there, you know, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1346.48s)]
*  you see things like, there's a science funding program that obviously you're familiar with [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1349.3600000000001s)]
*  called HHMI, the Howard Hughes kind of medical institute. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1353.92s)]
*  They give grants sort of along the lines of sort of how CCI does where, you know, they're [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1359.0400000000002s)]
*  longer term, they're kind of more open-ended and so on. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1363.44s)]
*  Pierre Asselaer at MIT wrote a paper a couple of years ago and trying to look at, well, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1366.48s)]
*  if you take, you know, ostensibly identical scientists who, you know, some of whom receive [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1370.96s)]
*  HHMI grants, some of whom don't, you know, how much more successful are the HHMI recipients? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1374.0800000000002s)]
*  And he concluded they're about twice as likely to produce a kind of top 1% paper by citation [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1380.1200000000001s)]
*  count. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1385.2800000000002s)]
*  Again, that's really suggestive. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1386.2800000000002s)]
*  Top 1% if they do what? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1387.68s)]
*  They're about twice as likely to produce a top 1% paper by citation count. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1388.68s)]
*  If they receive an HHMI grant. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1393.32s)]
*  Well, that might be correlation, not causation. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1396.32s)]
*  Yeah, so he tries to control. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1399.28s)]
*  They do get a lot of the best people. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1400.28s)]
*  Yeah, so he tries to control for that and, you know, he's a reasonable methodology for [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1402.28s)]
*  us, but some of it could totally be sort of that just, you know, selection effect. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1405.76s)]
*  But again, I think it's very suggestive that, hmm, maybe there are things we could do that [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1409.6399999999999s)]
*  would, you know, better enable this kind of discovery. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1413.56s)]
*  And you know, this might seem like a bit of a red herring, but I think it is kind of, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1418.04s)]
*  you know, again, suggestive that in many other domains where we can objectively assess progress, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1423.2s)]
*  it's very clear that our productivity has fallen off a cliff and for reasons that we [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1428.7s)]
*  can be pretty sure are not that it's getting intrinsically harder. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1433.84s)]
*  And so, you know, for example, when New York decided to build a subway in 1900, right, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1437.08s)]
*  they decided to build it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1441.96s)]
*  Four point seven years later, they opened 23 subway stations and in 2019 dollars, they [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1443.36s)]
*  spent just over a billion dollars doing so, right? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1448.12s)]
*  So 23 stations, just over a billion dollars. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1449.96s)]
*  When New York decided to build a second avenue subway in 2000, 17 years later, they opened [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1451.96s)]
*  three stations and spent four and a half billion dollars doing so, right? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1457.28s)]
*  And so kind of our productivity in subway construction has, you know, at least in New [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1460.62s)]
*  York, you know, decreased by a factor of 40. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1466.4s)]
*  Here in the Bay Area, we decided to build the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1469.4s)]
*  starting in 1933. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1473.84s)]
*  Both projects finished within four years. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1476.08s)]
*  And then to celebrate it, we decided to build a man-made island and we built that island [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1477.88s)]
*  in 18 months. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1481.48s)]
*  And I haven't tried, but I would wager that if one tried to build a new island in San [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1483.48s)]
*  Francisco, it would be difficult to do so today in 18 months. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1489.04s)]
*  And so California, you know, you have high-speed rail. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1493.16s)]
*  When France decided to build the TGV, it's high-speed rail. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1497.28s)]
*  It opened the first line after five years. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1501.8400000000001s)]
*  California started pursuing high-speed rail 11 years ago. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1504.52s)]
*  They forecast, we forecast being finished in 2033. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1506.76s)]
*  So we project a 25-year project, but of course, that's a projection. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1510.0s)]
*  It'll probably end up being much longer still. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1512.5600000000002s)]
*  So this is a domain where it's hard to imagine getting infrastructure, or excuse me, the [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1514.16s)]
*  building infrastructure has gotten intrinsically harder, right? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1518.8000000000002s)]
*  The atoms aren't physically heavier than they used to be, right? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1521.9199999999998s)]
*  And so clearly there's something institutional, sociological going on with infrastructure. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1525.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, Larry Summers talks about the idea of the sort of promiscuous distribution of [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1529.8s)]
*  the veto power and just how much harder it is to sort of get things done. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1534.48s)]
*  In as much as that's true, then there's the question of, well, you know, have other institutions, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1538.76s)]
*  have other sort of progress-generating mechanisms in our society, have they also got less efficient? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1543.6799999999998s)]
*  And if so, you know, what can we do about it? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1549.04s)]
*  So as an aside, if you're watching this, Patrick collects these examples of projects, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1550.72s)]
*  historical projects that went fast and that you can't imagine how they went that fast. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1558.16s)]
*  So if you Google his website, he has like a whole list of these that I think is pretty [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1563.84s)]
*  interesting and compelling when you go through all of them. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1569.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just important to understand how effectively we as a species, you know, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1571.92s)]
*  how effectively we can do things when we're organized the right way. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1581.3200000000002s)]
*  Humanity is pretty amazing. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1584.8400000000001s)]
*  And when, you know, possibilities are unlocked, when, you know, efficacy is enabled, we can [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1586.96s)]
*  do great things. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1592.3200000000002s)]
*  So sometimes it is a matter of actual will. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1593.3200000000002s)]
*  So for the last 40 years, getting around for almost all Americans, it is slower. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1596.2s)]
*  Before that, we had a period from 1800, say to 1970, when it got quicker and quicker and [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1601.04s)]
*  quicker. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1606.1599999999999s)]
*  And now even flying in airplanes for most people is slower. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1607.1599999999999s)]
*  Traffic is worse. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1610.44s)]
*  Those are solvable problems. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1611.6399999999999s)]
*  Manhattan should have congestion pricing and a stiffer form of it than they're likely to [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1612.96s)]
*  opt for. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1616.98s)]
*  So the notion that people have lost the ability to imagine a future much different and much [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1618.58s)]
*  better than what they know, to me, is one of the most worrying aspects of where we are [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1623.96s)]
*  now. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1628.52s)]
*  And this shows up quantitatively. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1630.08s)]
*  I mean, if you look at sort of the percentage of Americans who think that their kids' lives [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1631.08s)]
*  will be better than theirs, that has been in sort of monotonic decline, well, not strictly [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1635.8s)]
*  monotonic, but generally declining since World War II. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1640.52s)]
*  And so on an empirical basis, Americans are getting less hopeful about their futures, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1644.4s)]
*  their kids' futures. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1648.52s)]
*  And that's a really bad thing because it can be kind of an awful, catalyzing process and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1649.56s)]
*  a self-fulfilling prophecy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1652.72s)]
*  And we're supposed to be the most optimistic, forward-looking country. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1654.18s)]
*  The data on France, how many people think their kids will be worse off, that's much [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1657.0s)]
*  more worrying yet. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1660.32s)]
*  And there may be a self-fulfilling prophecy to this. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1661.74s)]
*  If you think the future won't be so great, you'll invest less, you won't work as hard, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  you'll contract, you're risk-taking, and you end up with a kind of social and economic [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1667.56s)]
*  malaise. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1671.96s)]
*  And indeed, you see falling rates of economic growth in most of the Western world. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1672.96s)]
*  So I'm curious how you would think about going about and studying these kind of organizational [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1677.3600000000001s)]
*  changes. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1681.4s)]
*  So going back to biomedical science, for example, just because this is an area that [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1682.4s)]
*  we do a lot of work in. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1684.76s)]
*  You know, the woman who runs our, who runs CZI's science initiative, Corrie Bargman, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1685.76s)]
*  she's a very renowned scientist, and she has this theory about that a lot of the granting [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1691.4s)]
*  process that NIH does, but also HHMI, it basically encourages very individualistic work, right? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1698.64s)]
*  You give people grants, they work on their own, you're not incentivizing people to work [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1705.72s)]
*  together. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1710.04s)]
*  People actually want to work together, they want to coordinate. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1711.04s)]
*  And when I was talking about the human cell atlas, you know, a lot of the issue there [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1713.56s)]
*  that needed to get dealt with was, you know, a lot of people were working on cell atlases [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1717.68s)]
*  for different parts of the body, okay, the liver cell atlas, you know, whatever. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1723.04s)]
*  But they were all in different data types and formats, so that way you couldn't compile [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1728.48s)]
*  a holistic thing. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1732.64s)]
*  So a lot of what she did in the work of CZI was basically helping to coordinate that way [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1733.96s)]
*  when these grants were given, everything, like the teams worked together, the data types [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1739.72s)]
*  were similar, so that way it all added up to a bigger thing. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1744.72s)]
*  And that certainly seems like one of many theories that one could have for how you could [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1748.1200000000001s)]
*  organize this stuff better. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1752.04s)]
*  But there's this question of how much of progress, whether that's something that one could have [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1753.76s)]
*  determined just through historical data versus this is the type of thing that you need people [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1758.52s)]
*  or the government or foundations to go out and just run different experiments and see [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1764.06s)]
*  how this works. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1769.08s)]
*  And I'm curious how you think about in terms of studying this, how much of this is like [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1770.08s)]
*  is history and kind of history of science based on data that's already out there versus [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1773.56s)]
*  we should just try different models of things and encourage more creativity and more competition [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1779.32s)]
*  and try different things. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1785.04s)]
*  It's striking to me if you look at American universities, the list of the top places in [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1786.48s)]
*  1920 and the list today is completely the same except we've added on California, otherwise [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1790.52s)]
*  no change. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1795.8799999999999s)]
*  Top 50 universities, if you look at... [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1797.32s)]
*  It's very different, it's companies. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1799.4399999999998s)]
*  Of course, even from 1980. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1801.12s)]
*  Even decade over decade. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1803.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1804.72s)]
*  The list of the top 10 companies by market cap almost completely turns over. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1805.72s)]
*  Procedures for tenure in the top 50 research universities, almost exactly the same. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1810.2s)]
*  Whatever you think of those, there's something gone wrong in the sector. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1814.52s)]
*  There's not enough experimentation with how you reward people. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1817.8s)]
*  More schools should experiment with a different kind of tenure or reward people more on the [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1821.24s)]
*  basis of practical impact. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1825.24s)]
*  Again, you might object to any particular solution, but the extent to which experimentation [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1827.12s)]
*  has died at the institutional level to me is striking. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1832.08s)]
*  And to underscore that point, if you look at the top 25 universities in the world today [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1836.4799999999998s)]
*  or the times of ranking, there's lots of them. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1842.4399999999998s)]
*  Seven of the top 25 are American universities that were started in a single 30-year period [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1846.8s)]
*  between 1861 and 1891. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1853.1599999999999s)]
*  If you look at where those universities come from and what were the people behind them [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1856.32s)]
*  thinking, they were very deliberately, specifically reform-minded. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1859.56s)]
*  And progress-minded. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1864.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1865.04s)]
*  They thought, well, obviously, academic institutions exist. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1866.04s)]
*  Harvard, Yale, and so on were already around. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1869.56s)]
*  But they saw the success of the German research university model. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1871.76s)]
*  They saw the possibilities of the US and they saw at least what they thought was required [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1875.28s)]
*  for the future. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1879.56s)]
*  And they very deliberately decided, we will try something different. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1880.56s)]
*  And again, that yielded now seven of the top 25 universities today. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1884.76s)]
*  So I think it's kind of strongly, kind of empirically underscores the value of the kind [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1889.92s)]
*  of experimentation you're talking about. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1894.28s)]
*  And fully agree, I think we should be historically informed, but ultimately a certain amount [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1896.04s)]
*  of sort of commitment, decision, and just willingness to experiment is going to be required. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1901.26s)]
*  The other thing I think your point about sort of the teams gets at is there are these really [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1905.76s)]
*  of just like productive cultures through history, right? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1912.6s)]
*  If you look at Vienna, 1880 to 1940 or something, you have in so many different fields, you [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1914.8s)]
*  have people who did this sort of incredibly formative work. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1922.8s)]
*  You had Klimt and you had Mahler and you had Mach in physics and you had, of course, Austrian [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1926.6s)]
*  economics and von Mises and Hayek and all the rest. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1931.3999999999999s)]
*  You had Freud and you had Wittgenstein. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1934.76s)]
*  Vienna was sort of amazing in this period. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1937.4399999999998s)]
*  When you kind of dig into the specific stories, you realize a lot of these people knew each [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1940.04s)]
*  other and they were sort of inspired by each other. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1943.32s)]
*  They kind of give credit to each other for, again, across multiple disciplines, sort of [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1946.6s)]
*  different parts of their thinking. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1952.6399999999999s)]
*  Or if you look at Edinburgh, so during the Scottish Enlightenment, again, it's a tiny [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1953.6399999999999s)]
*  place. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1960.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean Edinburgh at the time, say in 1780, was like the size of Santa Cruz, right? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1961.6399999999999s)]
*  And yet you get sort of modern economics from Smith. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1966.28s)]
*  You have Hume, you have the birth of modern geology, amazing literature, poetry and so [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1970.08s)]
*  on. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1976.68s)]
*  And so clearly there was something extant in Edinburgh in 1780 that was not there in [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1978.72s)]
*  Dublin in 1780. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1985.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think obviously it's hard to pin down what was that, but at the same time, the difficulty [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1987.6399999999999s)]
*  to finance doesn't mean it wasn't there or it's not important. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1994.1799999999998s)]
*  I would say this, I'm sitting here with two university dropouts. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=1996.86s)]
*  That's notable to me. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2000.34s)]
*  The Bay Area is our modern Vienna, you know, Bravo to the Bay Area, but we're not working [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2001.58s)]
*  nearly hard enough to build other new Viennese and other places. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2006.4599999999998s)]
*  And I don't really think it's quite Manhattan anymore. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2010.4199999999998s)]
*  It's a wonderful city, amazing place to go, but it is not a world leader for ideas in [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2012.58s)]
*  the way it was, say, the 1920s through the 1980s. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2017.4199999999998s)]
*  People study this, right? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2021.4599999999998s)]
*  So what have been the main things that people have learned so far from studying Vienna or [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2022.94s)]
*  Edinburgh? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2028.42s)]
*  I don't think there's a rich literature of lessons from those places. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2029.42s)]
*  Obviously, lots has been written about them. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2033.8600000000001s)]
*  They're great historical accounts. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2037.14s)]
*  I've enjoyed reading them. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2038.7s)]
*  But I mean, well, it's an intrinsically very difficult thing to do to figure out, well, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2040.9s)]
*  which things causally mattered. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2045.18s)]
*  There's a certain degree to which they might be kind of overdetermined. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2048.78s)]
*  And so I think it's very hard to...you don't have counterfactuals. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2053.14s)]
*  Obviously, you can't run trials. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2056.7s)]
*  And so I think it is a very difficult question to answer. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2058.38s)]
*  And I think for understandable reasons, people studying these questions are reluctant to [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2062.02s)]
*  take definitive stances that this is what mattered in 1900 Vienna. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2067.34s)]
*  But one lesson I would say, the Scottish islands, people moved to Edinburgh, right? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2072.38s)]
*  Vienna, you have Jews coming in from the Pale of Settlement. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2077.02s)]
*  The Bay Area, people coming from all over the world. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2079.5800000000004s)]
*  And indeed, you're from Ireland. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2082.1000000000004s)]
*  So immigration, immigration is not a guarantee of things going well. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2083.6200000000003s)]
*  But the bringing together of different ideas and cultures and the new clash of opposing [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2088.26s)]
*  perspectives has been correlated with a lot of these Viennese in the world history. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2092.9s)]
*  Very true, although I'm pretty sure that in 1900, Paris had more foreigners than Vienna. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2100.26s)]
*  I think it was like 2% in Vienna. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2104.62s)]
*  So anyway, I very much agree with the point. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2106.06s)]
*  If you go from the Scottish islands to Edinburgh in 1740, that's a huge difference. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2108.14s)]
*  It's a bigger difference maybe than, you know, Mexico to Los Angeles today. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2112.94s)]
*  If you're thinking about what kind of work to fund in terms of studying historical progress, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2117.1s)]
*  what's your framework for figuring out where to even begin studying? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2123.78s)]
*  Because I mean, what you're talking about here is basically studying the economic and [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2127.82s)]
*  scientific result of immigration, which is obviously a massively socially important debate. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2133.82s)]
*  That's the center of a lot of political debates and has been for a long time. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2139.7400000000002s)]
*  So from one perspective, it would be very, it's sort of surprising that it wouldn't have [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2143.6600000000003s)]
*  been studied in more detail to understand the impact of it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2148.7400000000002s)]
*  But that's very different from kind of the biomedical science type stuff that we were [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2153.6200000000003s)]
*  talking about a second ago. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2157.1000000000004s)]
*  Do you have a framework in your head for how you would think about or prioritizing studying [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2158.86s)]
*  in different areas? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2164.82s)]
*  Or is it mostly just about finding really sharp people who have new ideas and funding [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2165.82s)]
*  them to do different kinds of work? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2171.46s)]
*  Or how do you think about that overall? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2172.78s)]
*  People who are curious, people who have bold ambitions, people who have what I call stamina, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2174.58s)]
*  they just don't ever stop. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2180.54s)]
*  People who are working in productive small groups, that may be through WhatsApp in fact, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2182.98s)]
*  or it could be their next door neighbors, their colleagues at a university. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2186.86s)]
*  When those say four items come together, then I think you have possibly what is a very good [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2190.06s)]
*  funding decision. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2195.42s)]
*  And I would take a lot of chances on those people not worry too much about the micromanaging [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2196.7000000000003s)]
*  and let talent rip and let groups form and see what happens. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2201.54s)]
*  Got it. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2205.46s)]
*  So it's very much like entrepreneurship in that way. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2206.46s)]
*  You're betting on the person more than the idea. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2208.6600000000003s)]
*  But also the vision, right? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2210.1400000000003s)]
*  There has to be a vision. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2211.1400000000003s)]
*  And there are plenty of successful entrepreneurs who are not curious. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2212.44s)]
*  So for intellectual progress, to really put curiosity very highly is part of my philosophy. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2215.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2220.3s)]
*  And I want to be kind of careful here. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2221.3s)]
*  On the one hand, not only do we acknowledge that an immense amount of very important, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2224.46s)]
*  insightful work has already been created. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2230.26s)]
*  And it's that work that to a large degree has, I think, inspired both of our viewpoints. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2233.98s)]
*  For example, the paper Tyler mentioned about declining research productivity in semiconductors, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2241.58s)]
*  crop yields, and a couple of other fields that was done fairly close to here. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2249.06s)]
*  That is work squarely relevant to these questions that I think is really important. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2252.66s)]
*  And we may not be here in the same way without it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2257.06s)]
*  On the other hand, it is simultaneously true that major sways of these questions really [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2259.7599999999998s)]
*  are surprisingly under-investigated. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2266.96s)]
*  And so again, just to return to biomedical funding and the NIH, as far as I can tell, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2269.0s)]
*  there are no books assessing how well is the NIH working. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2275.92s)]
*  And I don't have a strong view on the answer to that question. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2281.0s)]
*  But I do have a strong view on the importance of knowing. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2284.36s)]
*  And which parts of the NIH are working better and worse? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2288.24s)]
*  And inasmuch as the NIH has changed over the last couple of decades, was the old NIH better [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2291.04s)]
*  or the new one? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2295.42s)]
*  This stuff is so important. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2297.32s)]
*  And so while it's the case that there's a huge amount of good research happening today [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2298.32s)]
*  with fantastic researchers, in a sense, there aren't enough of them. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2301.52s)]
*  And a lot of the central questions are still unanswered. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2305.92s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2307.92s)]
*  So you were talking a minute ago about the explosion in costs in healthcare. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2308.92s)]
*  And right now, I think one of the defining aspects of the moment that we're in is a lot [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2315.84s)]
*  of the basic costs of living for a lot of people have just increased a lot. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2320.7000000000003s)]
*  The story that we tell about our society is that you have technology and you have competition [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2325.6s)]
*  and it drives down prices. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2331.0s)]
*  So if you bought a TV today, if you bought a TV from a 10-year-old TV today, it would [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2333.12s)]
*  cost 5% of what it cost 10 years ago. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2340.44s)]
*  So clearly the value and efficiency has increased a lot there. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2345.12s)]
*  But then in things that matter so much, like healthcare, education, rent, those things [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2349.68s)]
*  have generally just increased. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2356.96s)]
*  And the normal dynamics that you would be hoping would play out aren't. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2359.4s)]
*  And to some degree, for the quality of life for a lot of people, the increases in those [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2364.68s)]
*  costs may even be dwarfing all the other advances and everything else. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2369.02s)]
*  So do you think that those things are all related? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2374.56s)]
*  Or do you think, I mean, I think you used the phrase cost disease, right? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  When referring to the cost explosion of things like healthcare and education, student debt, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2384.68s)]
*  and rent, do you think that that's a different type of problem? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2391.16s)]
*  Or do you think that that is fundamentally related to the rate of progress in biomedicine [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2395.16s)]
*  as an example? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2402.56s)]
*  I think there are common features to these problems, though each one is different. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2403.7999999999997s)]
*  Restrictions on entry is one. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2407.68s)]
*  Highly bureaucratized institutions. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  Sometimes a lot of third-party payment, which may be required in the case of catastrophic [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2412.2s)]
*  healthcare, but it nonetheless has distorting effects. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2416.04s)]
*  Areas where people have very strong moral feelings, I think we often make worse decisions [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2419.7599999999998s)]
*  about, we're not analytical enough. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2423.72s)]
*  And you put all of those together, but I would stress, say healthcare, if you go to Singapore, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2426.72s)]
*  I think it's about 4% of GDP. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2431.88s)]
*  They have slightly higher life expectancy than we do. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2434.28s)]
*  Their system is by no means perfect. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2437.1600000000003s)]
*  But we can see through comparative analysis, there are ways of doing this better. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2439.0800000000004s)]
*  The NIMBY problem, cost of living, getting an apartment. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2444.0400000000004s)]
*  In Japan, it is mostly solved because building in Japan tends to be regulated at higher levels [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2446.6000000000004s)]
*  than the city or the county, so more gets built. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2453.0800000000004s)]
*  Living in Japan is cheaper, the cost of renting an apartment. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2456.0800000000004s)]
*  So often we kind of know the answers. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2459.24s)]
*  We shy away from really focusing on a concerted effort to get to doing them in this country. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2462.12s)]
*  I agree with all of that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2468.08s)]
*  I would just underscore the entry costs aspect. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2469.3999999999996s)]
*  And the entry costs aren't always, or they, I think, take different forms, right? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2472.56s)]
*  And that sort of, impurity of the entry costs of forming a new university are really high, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  but that's not because there's a kind of formal toll you have to pay. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2482.04s)]
*  It's not like zoning where there are deliberate, specific legal restrictions that prohibit [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2486.04s)]
*  you from doing so. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2491.84s)]
*  But just as a practical matter, sociologically, institutionally, accreditation dynamics, who [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2494.0s)]
*  knows, it's apparently almost impossibly difficult to create a successful new university today. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2499.72s)]
*  And so I think answering the cost of these questions is one of the most important sort [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2506.24s)]
*  of subcomponents in this broader question of what is it that enables our progress. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2511.7599999999998s)]
*  And at an overarching level, it's just surprising to me that we don't have sort of more definitive [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  and clear answers there. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2523.8399999999997s)]
*  Alex Tabarrok, a colleague of Tyler. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2524.8399999999997s)]
*  Wrote a long paper on the question. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2527.04s)]
*  Exactly, last summer. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2528.64s)]
*  And there are other papers also analyzing the question, but it's a surprisingly sparse [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2531.24s)]
*  literature. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2539.44s)]
*  Alex's list of citations was not that long. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2540.88s)]
*  And he had some suggestions as to what the underlying etiology might be. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2544.04s)]
*  Maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2550.0s)]
*  But again, to your point, it's one of the most pressing questions for American society, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2551.08s)]
*  for global society in 2019. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2557.92s)]
*  We really have to know what's happening. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2560.7400000000002s)]
*  And to return to something Tyler said earlier, part of our hope, it's not to kind of promote [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2562.48s)]
*  any specific solution, any specific aspect of it, but rather that even though this is [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2567.52s)]
*  not what's kind of fokally central in the headlines today, it should be. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2575.84s)]
*  And as we think about what the world is going to look like in 50 years or in 100 years, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2580.8s)]
*  it plausibly more than anything else is going to determine the shape of that. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2584.36s)]
*  As an entrepreneur, what is it you find most striking about America's dysfunctional economic [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2588.28s)]
*  sectors? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2593.24s)]
*  Because you intersect with them all the time, right? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2594.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would want to see this get studied more. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2596.04s)]
*  But so there are just so many different factors. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2600.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think part of what is a little bit confusing is that the things that are making health [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2604.04s)]
*  care so expensive, they may have some fundamental link to the things that make college tuition [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2609.6800000000003s)]
*  so expensive. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2616.04s)]
*  But on its surface, it seems like there are also more proximate causes that are quite [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2617.04s)]
*  different. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2622.4s)]
*  And so with college tuition, the fact that, OK, it's really expensive, so then we do more [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2623.4s)]
*  to subsidize the cost of it. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2630.0s)]
*  And then by doing so, we're not providing any pressure on colleges to make it more efficient. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2632.04s)]
*  And then the cost just goes up further. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2637.96s)]
*  It's a pretty different dynamic than what's going on with health care, where we're basically, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2639.48s)]
*  Americans want to know that if someone in their family gets sick, they're going to be [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2646.52s)]
*  able to get every treatment possible, which ends up, I mean, I'm sure you've seen all [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2650.84s)]
*  the stats on this, that half of the health care costs that someone incurs are in the [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2657.4s)]
*  last six months of their life. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2661.88s)]
*  And that's, I guess, part of what you're saying is an American moral value, which is that [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2664.04s)]
*  we believe that you should do everything you can to help someone who's sick, whereas in [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2670.2400000000002s)]
*  a lot of other countries, I don't know what Singapore's situation is, but a lot of the [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2673.6400000000003s)]
*  that are often cited as more efficient health care systems don't have that approach. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2677.72s)]
*  They say, OK, OK, if someone in your family has this form of cancer, we'll do these two [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2682.7599999999998s)]
*  treatments and then we're done. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2688.16s)]
*  And part of that is because they may not be able to incur the level of debt as a country [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2691.4s)]
*  that the US can, so they may just have to make that trade off. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2696.24s)]
*  But it creates all these downstream dynamics where, OK, now if you as a society are willing [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2699.32s)]
*  to say, OK, we're going to have two treatments for this kind of cancer, not do not try all [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2703.84s)]
*  seven things, then now, you know, France can go, for example, negotiate with the drug companies [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2708.84s)]
*  and say, all right, I'm only going to support the two that are the most cost effective and [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2714.1600000000003s)]
*  the other ones are out to dry, whereas in the American system, you don't have that kind [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2718.2000000000003s)]
*  of negotiating leverage. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2722.52s)]
*  So it seems like they're very different things. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2723.52s)]
*  But I kind of intuitively, it seems like at their root, there should be some commonalities. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2726.6000000000004s)]
*  And I would be very interested to kind of understand that in more detail. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2733.08s)]
*  I'm curious why, you know, from what you're saying about that the literature is sparse. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2736.32s)]
*  Well, on catheters in particular. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2741.68s)]
*  Yeah, why do you think more people aren't studying this? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2743.88s)]
*  I mean, given that this is just such a central thing in the lives of most people, right, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2746.68s)]
*  it's, I mean, the cost of living in cities has gone up so much. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2751.92s)]
*  We have a whole generation of students. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2755.84s)]
*  I think the total student debt is now almost $2 trillion, right? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2757.48s)]
*  I think it was 1.7, the last stat that I saw. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2762.08s)]
*  And of course, healthcare is, you know, the number of people in the country who are within [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2764.36s)]
*  one issue of being bankrupt is just kind of staggering. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2768.7200000000003s)]
*  So what's preventing people from studying this? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2773.4s)]
*  I wouldn't say anything's preventing them. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2777.7200000000003s)]
*  The incentive is to build a brick and to build a brick that can survive scrutiny by referees. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2779.04s)]
*  The incentive is not to build a building in most cases. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2784.2400000000002s)]
*  Biomedicine actually is often different, but in the social sciences. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2787.4s)]
*  So there's so many bricks out there. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2791.06s)]
*  And so people want to say, oh, we're already studying this. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2792.98s)]
*  It's correct. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2795.06s)]
*  The bricks are there in the millions. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2796.06s)]
*  But the bricks in the buildings are a different thing. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2797.1s)]
*  But I have a question for you, if I may be allowed. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2799.66s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2801.62s)]
*  What is it you would most like to see from academics? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2802.62s)]
*  And I don't mean research on social media. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2805.22s)]
*  I mean, America, the world. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2807.38s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2809.82s)]
*  Although I would like more research on social media. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2810.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2813.46s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2814.46s)]
*  No, look, I think that these issues on exploding costs and why these systems aren't working [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2815.86s)]
*  the way that they're supposed to for people is probably one of the most pressing questions. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2822.54s)]
*  When I think about our work over the next decade and it's like, what are we going to [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2828.06s)]
*  do that's going to fundamentally make people's lives better? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2832.78s)]
*  There's a lot that we can do. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2838.14s)]
*  But if these problems continue at the rate that they're going at, it's actually quite [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2840.3s)]
*  hard for me to imagine how we could do enough good to overcome the increase in costs that [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2844.8199999999997s)]
*  people are incurring at things that are so fundamental. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2851.2999999999997s)]
*  So we're working on them in somewhat different ways. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2855.14s)]
*  I think health care is difficult because it is so inherently political because it touches [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2860.4199999999996s)]
*  on moral values. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2865.6s)]
*  If you want to have a difference in approach of how we treat the last six months of people's [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2867.2599999999998s)]
*  That's something that's more of a democratic question than a technocratic one, I think. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2871.86s)]
*  People need to be able to support that. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2876.2200000000003s)]
*  So I don't personally feel like that's an area that I'm going to have a huge impact. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2878.94s)]
*  A lot of people are focused on that. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2882.7400000000002s)]
*  But the area that I do think we can make a big impact is on long-term science research. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2884.38s)]
*  So if you can just make it more efficient to cure, prevent, or manage diseases, then [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2888.58s)]
*  that over the long term should really be the answer for bringing health care costs in line, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2892.82s)]
*  not in the next 10 years, but maybe over the next 50 years. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2897.06s)]
*  I'd like to see a solution before that. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2900.98s)]
*  So I'd love to see more studying of the health care part of this. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2902.58s)]
*  But on the science side, I'm quite optimistic about that. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2905.42s)]
*  On housing, I don't know. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2908.5s)]
*  There's always the question of which forces in technology end up being stronger than, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2911.5s)]
*  which trends end up being stronger. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2918.1s)]
*  So on the one hand, you have this giant mismatch of opportunity where people feel compelled [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2919.5s)]
*  to move to cities because that's kind of where a lot of the jobs are. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2925.58s)]
*  But then there's not enough building of supply of housing. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2930.42s)]
*  So rent just increases. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2933.02s)]
*  And then that means that even though people are going and doing higher value things, their [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2934.98s)]
*  lives actually aren't benefiting as much from that because so much of their costs are just [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2939.38s)]
*  of the value that they're generating is just going to housing because rent is getting so [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2943.46s)]
*  high. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2946.9s)]
*  So, I mean, historically, what have people done? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2947.9s)]
*  I mean, we invented cars and freeways. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2949.7s)]
*  That way people could live further out. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2953.7s)]
*  I mean, maybe something like the Hyperloop could extend suburbs like five times as far. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2955.42s)]
*  So that could make it so someone could live quite further away. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2961.26s)]
*  And that would be good if you can increase the effective radius of a city. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2964.6200000000003s)]
*  That's one way to alleviate constraints, political constraints or concerns about people building [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2969.38s)]
*  things. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2975.1000000000004s)]
*  So that way you can get more supply, bring the cost down. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2976.1000000000004s)]
*  But I happen to think a different thing is probably the right solution. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2978.46s)]
*  In 2019, it's a lot easier to move bits around than it is atoms. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2983.7400000000002s)]
*  So rather than people moving, inventing a new Hyperloop or cars, I tend to think that [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2987.46s)]
*  the set of technologies around, whether it's augmented reality or virtual reality or video [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=2993.86s)]
*  presence that just let people be where they want to be physically and feel present with [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3000.26s)]
*  other people wherever they need to be to do their job, to connect with the people they [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3004.82s)]
*  care about. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3010.14s)]
*  That feels to me like the better long-term solution. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3011.74s)]
*  Don't make everyone move to cities. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3014.3799999999997s)]
*  Make it so people can choose where they want to be and can get access to all the opportunities [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3016.5s)]
*  they want everyone. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3019.54s)]
*  So those are kind of... [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3020.54s)]
*  It's hard for me to imagine more important problems, at least over the next... pressing [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3021.74s)]
*  problems for the next decade. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3027.3799999999997s)]
*  I think over the longer term, potentially climate change is more of an existential issue. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3028.3799999999997s)]
*  But in terms of people's lives today, I think the exploding costs from these areas is such [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3034.5s)]
*  a profound issue and the trend is so out of control. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3040.98s)]
*  Three quick points on that. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3047.5s)]
*  One is I think these questions are often a little bit... like the cost of these questions, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3049.86s)]
*  I think one of the reasons it's kind of difficult to study is because you sort of have to take [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3055.9s)]
*  this very macroscopic and potentially this very microscopic view. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3059.02s)]
*  And so say, for example, in science, if it were the case that the administrative burden [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3062.34s)]
*  on scientists had increased by say two thirds over the last 40 years, not saying it has [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3067.18s)]
*  and not saying that even if it has, that is in fact the cause of any kind of slowdown. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3071.98s)]
*  But if it had, that might be quite difficult to observe because it could come in the form [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3076.1s)]
*  of well, it takes twice as long on average for things to be approved and the forms are [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3080.42s)]
*  kind of longer and you're interrupted more. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3086.7799999999997s)]
*  And so actually specifically diagnosing the kind of causal pathways I think can really [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3088.94s)]
*  be quite tricky. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3093.72s)]
*  I think that generalizes a lot of the fields. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3094.7999999999997s)]
*  And secondly, to your point about sort of technology potentially solving the ad lamination [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3096.68s)]
*  kind of imperative of cities, I think that could be true, although here we are in person. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3102.2799999999997s)]
*  Others are watching. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3107.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but the people are watching and everywhere else. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3108.2799999999997s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3111.2799999999997s)]
*  Very fair. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3112.2799999999997s)]
*  But even if technology solves that, I guess my worry would be that the sort of the socio-institutional [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3113.2799999999997s)]
*  dynamics that have kind of ruined cities or made them less effective or whatever probably [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3118.28s)]
*  also generalize and apply to other domains. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3123.96s)]
*  And so we're going to suffer the cost of those same phenomena elsewhere. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3127.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3130.44s)]
*  And what do you want to ask, Mark? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3133.2400000000002s)]
*  Well I guess what have you learned from doing CZI in that, I mean you launched it five years [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3137.2400000000002s)]
*  ago? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3143.28s)]
*  Four years ago. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3144.94s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3145.94s)]
*  How would the next four years be different to the first four? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3146.94s)]
*  Well so one of the things that we struggle with here is these are such long-term projects, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3148.78s)]
*  right? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3155.42s)]
*  So we talked a lot about the scientific research. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3156.42s)]
*  We're also doing a bunch of work with education to build tools for teachers to do more project-based [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3158.38s)]
*  learning, more personalized learning for kids, but basically make it so that teachers have [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3165.3s)]
*  tools to do the work that they want to do, mentor students, and not just have to lecture [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3170.94s)]
*  and have everyone learn at the same pace. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3176.2599999999998s)]
*  So this stuff, we're making progress in all of these areas. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3180.06s)]
*  And I think one of the meta questions in running CZI is at what point to check in and consider [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3183.1s)]
*  evolving the direction. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3190.98s)]
*  I mean obviously there's minor execution things that you try to improve along the way, but [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3191.98s)]
*  I want to make sure that we have an awareness that these are fundamentally problems that [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3196.54s)]
*  we're going to be working on for 10 or 20 years and not, I think a lot of these things [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3200.7599999999998s)]
*  just kind of a consistency of approach and building trust is kind of more important than [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3205.86s)]
*  constantly evaluating or potentially thrashing. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3213.76s)]
*  In science, we've had the benefit of taking on a number of different projects, right? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3216.52s)]
*  So the human cell atlas was one of the original ones. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3220.76s)]
*  Now one of the next areas that we're really excited to work on is imaging. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3223.2400000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of advances in microscopy, but there are a lot of things that we still can't [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3229.28s)]
*  see. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3233.2s)]
*  And as engineers, I think one of the things that you can probably appreciate is when you're [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3234.8799999999997s)]
*  trying to debug a system, you really want to get into the code and step through it and [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3241.56s)]
*  see where the thing is breaking down. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3246.04s)]
*  But we don't really have a way today to see a white blood cell eat a virus, right? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3248.08s)]
*  In vivo, right? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3258.9199999999996s)]
*  In the body, to see proteins folding live. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3260.16s)]
*  And I think that there are certain optical levels, optical thresholds on the physics [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3264.64s)]
*  that you might not be able to get beyond. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3268.9s)]
*  But between that and the advances in AI, I do think that it's possible to give scientists [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3272.6800000000003s)]
*  new imaging capacity that hasn't been possible before. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3280.06s)]
*  So a lot of what we're trying to do is, all right, so the human cell atlas, we took an [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3283.96s)]
*  approach, it was kind of very broad and collaborative and somewhat chaotic even in a way. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3287.2s)]
*  And I think we were able to learn some of the lessons from that as we're now thinking [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3295.2s)]
*  about how we organize the imaging project about, okay, maybe it would be helpful to [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3298.7599999999998s)]
*  have more clearly established leadership around it upfront. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3303.6s)]
*  Maybe there are things that, rather than having just one big project, there are going to be [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3310.12s)]
*  areas where we can just build tools that go into every lab. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3316.36s)]
*  There's one software package called NAPARI that a lot of scientists, it's like, right [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3319.88s)]
*  now the actual technology of microscopes is kind of ahead of scientists' ability to process [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3326.1600000000003s)]
*  the data. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3336.32s)]
*  So there's this weird mismatch because it kind of makes sense. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3337.32s)]
*  If you're, the NIH funding supports people to basically have a lab. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3339.56s)]
*  Tool building is not really subsidized or supported that well. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3345.24s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, if you want to have a team of ongoing software engineers, that's like, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3348.3599999999997s)]
*  okay, you're going to want an effort that's going on for a while. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3351.92s)]
*  That's more than a couple of people. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3355.16s)]
*  So that kind of thing, I think, there's a real niche that no one is doing that stuff [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3357.24s)]
*  at the scale that it needs to get done. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3361.8799999999997s)]
*  So just pushing on both of those. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3363.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's uniform agreement on that particular point from almost every biomedical [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3365.3599999999997s)]
*  scientist that I speak with, like tool building is under supported. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3368.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3371.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3372.8s)]
*  From a meta point, I'm a little wary of concluding which things have worked and not worked well [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3373.8s)]
*  yet. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3382.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, certainly not everything we're going to do is going to work. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3383.7200000000003s)]
*  It's four years. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3386.76s)]
*  It's too early to say. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3387.76s)]
*  Yeah, but it's certainly interesting. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3388.76s)]
*  What I try to push the teams to do is make sure that the work that we're doing are things [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3391.2000000000003s)]
*  that clearly would not have happened otherwise. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3395.7200000000003s)]
*  What I think, especially in a lot of these fields, in philanthropy, I think that there [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3398.1600000000003s)]
*  are a lot of potential issues with this where it's easy to give money to something and feel [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3401.72s)]
*  like you're doing good because you probably are doing some good, but then lack the discipline [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3409.04s)]
*  to say, okay, am I doing the most good that I can? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3414.68s)]
*  And I think we kind of have a responsibility to do that. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3418.2s)]
*  So that's the thing that I push our team to do is develop really different theories. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3422.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm quite confident that in education, the work that we're doing is just stuff that if [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3426.3199999999997s)]
*  we weren't trying it, it's not clear that anyone else would be doing an effort like [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3431.7599999999998s)]
*  this at scale. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3436.8399999999997s)]
*  I feel really good about that. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3438.24s)]
*  I think in imaging, something like that is going to be similar. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3439.24s)]
*  Even in social advocacy, we're doing a lot of work in criminal justice reform. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3442.2s)]
*  That's a combination of advocacy and building tools for accountability and working with [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3446.24s)]
*  more modern-minded prosecutors that they can be more data-driven about who they try [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3453.84s)]
*  to bring charges against because they want to be fair, or at least a lot of folks want [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3457.32s)]
*  to be fair, and they don't have the data to either optimize how they run their office [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3461.1400000000003s)]
*  or to hold the people in there accountable. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3466.84s)]
*  So building those kind of tools can be super helpful. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3469.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm quite confident that if we weren't pushing on that, I'm not... [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3473.1200000000003s)]
*  I feel good that that's a good theory to at least try to push on. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3477.08s)]
*  So that's what we try to do in the work. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3480.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3483.2s)]
*  So you play like the criminal justice work, education, biomedical. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3484.2s)]
*  What's the underlying view or insight or experience of yours that's the common element behind [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3487.24s)]
*  those areas? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3492.4399999999996s)]
*  Like how do we boil down Mark Zuckerberg philanthropy to a smaller number of dimensions? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3493.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's not just me. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3497.7599999999998s)]
*  I do it with my wife. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3499.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3500.2s)]
*  My apologies. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3501.2s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3502.2s)]
*  Well, she's an important element to this because she was a teacher. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3503.2s)]
*  Actually, she is a teacher. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3505.0s)]
*  She's building a school. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3506.8399999999997s)]
*  She spends a lot of time over there. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3508.3999999999996s)]
*  She is a doctor. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3509.72s)]
*  So if you're looking at the education and health aspects, the domain expertise is more [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3512.48s)]
*  hers than mine. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3518.88s)]
*  And she is quite, I think, compelling and insightful on some of the things that need [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3521.96s)]
*  to get done there. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3527.28s)]
*  In terms of the approach, that may be more inspired by me in some ways where it's the [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3528.36s)]
*  very long-term focus, which I think it comes from a lot of the lessons I've learned from [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3534.84s)]
*  Facebook. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3538.7200000000003s)]
*  It's the tool building, which comes from having the experience building engineering teams. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3540.32s)]
*  And it's some of what we've learned just in kind of managing and partnering with folks [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3547.2000000000003s)]
*  through building the company is that it's a lot of what you said. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3552.0s)]
*  It's like you want to bet on the best individuals in different spaces and give them room to [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3554.84s)]
*  run in managing complex projects. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3560.6400000000003s)]
*  You need to know when something needs to be a little more directive versus when you want [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3563.7200000000003s)]
*  it to just be an open thing that can make progress in a more chaotic way. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3568.4s)]
*  And that might be more art than science, or at least until your field fully solves all [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3572.32s)]
*  these questions. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3578.08s)]
*  But yeah, it's an interesting set of questions. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3579.08s)]
*  And certainly, I guess one animating theme certainly is as our kids grow up, we want [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3585.84s)]
*  to make sure that they live better lives. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3593.6400000000003s)]
*  So these aren't things that are primarily going to benefit us. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3596.68s)]
*  If you're trying to benefit us, we wouldn't be working on education. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3600.08s)]
*  I think the health work is very long-term oriented. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3602.32s)]
*  If we were focused on kind of our own health, you know, you'd be, we'd probably be doing [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3608.18s)]
*  more disease-specific work rather than fundamental science to try to, or tool building for fundamental [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3611.52s)]
*  science, which might even be a level more abstract than fundamental science to try to [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3617.48s)]
*  compound the rate of progress in science. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3621.64s)]
*  And then a lot of work on equality and making sure, you know, the criminal justice work, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3625.08s)]
*  I think is, I mean, a lot of the way that our country handles this stuff is just such [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3628.3199999999997s)]
*  an unfortunate outlier compared to other countries. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3634.4s)]
*  And the amount of human capital that is locked away is, you know, it's its own thing that [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3637.68s)]
*  I think deserves a lot more than studying. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3646.12s)]
*  But I mean, certainly, I think just improving that would be a big advance. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3649.44s)]
*  But I don't know, it's interesting. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3654.44s)]
*  I mean, this conversation is interesting because it's, I think it highlights somewhat of a [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3657.08s)]
*  distinction in, I guess, my approach to learning or studying these things is more the try different [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3661.12s)]
*  things and experiment and kind of, and then play it forward, generate new data that doesn't [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3668.7200000000003s)]
*  exist and see how that goes. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3674.36s)]
*  And talking to you and seeing the work that you do, and I guess this is probably intrinsic [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3678.84s)]
*  to being an academic too, where more of the work is about looking at data sets that can [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3683.68s)]
*  exist and studying what is already there rather than trying to kind of create the new data [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3690.32s)]
*  sets or approaches. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3695.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, there are two approaches that I think complement each other, but are actually quite [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3698.2400000000002s)]
*  different in terms of how you kind of approach learning about how to do the best work going [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3703.12s)]
*  forward. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3708.04s)]
*  Well, I think there is a very important, I'm sorry, sort of complementarity where, you [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3709.04s)]
*  know, for any of these kind of really important questions about sort of, you know, how should [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3714.8399999999997s)]
*  science be organized or which kinds of policies generate the most economic growth or how one [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3718.96s)]
*  should support the diffusion of innovation or whatever, I don't think there exists kind [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3723.2s)]
*  of definitive data on that question. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3727.0s)]
*  I don't think by sort of, you know, just going deep into the literature, you're going to [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3728.6s)]
*  come up with sort of clear answers that, you know, one can feel confident in going and [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3731.7999999999997s)]
*  executing or implementing. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3735.16s)]
*  I think of the data such as it exists and the existing findings as kind of, you know, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3737.1600000000003s)]
*  food for hypothesis generation. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3745.88s)]
*  And for example, you know, to kind of return to the management training one, like, I would [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3748.88s)]
*  probably not have guessed the effect sizes would be that large, right? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3755.44s)]
*  And so if those studies hadn't been conducted, I don't think, you know, I would have, you [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3759.2000000000003s)]
*  know, ascribed sort of particular, you know, sufficient expectation value to the effort [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3765.8s)]
*  of maybe, you know, Stripe going and doing something there. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3770.76s)]
*  But now because of those studies, I think, well, perhaps there are on the margins things [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3773.48s)]
*  we could do. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3777.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe there are things that end up being sort of quite materially valuable over time. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3778.7200000000003s)]
*  I think being able to sort of marshal those, you know, potentially being able to sort of [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3781.6400000000003s)]
*  encourage people to dig more sort of in sort of particular directions and then to, you [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3786.28s)]
*  know, combine that with a willingness to experiment and a willingness to, you know, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3791.2s)]
*  frankly, just be wrong. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3796.8399999999997s)]
*  I think kind of the synthesis of that is really powerful. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3800.2s)]
*  And again, if you go back and you look at the foundations that I think have really had [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3804.48s)]
*  significant impact over the past 100, 200 years, I think it's that kind of combination [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3811.04s)]
*  in that, you know, if you look at Warren Weaver, who is the guy who is at Rockefeller, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3818.12s)]
*  who funded Norman Borlaug, right, he had worked with Vannevar Bush at OSRD during World War [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3822.16s)]
*  II. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3829.48s)]
*  He, I think he was familiar with a lot of the data and just kind of empirical realities [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3830.48s)]
*  of, you know, how different kinds of scientific and technological ventures were likely to [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3840.3199999999997s)]
*  But he was also willing to just place a bold bet and that, you know, pursue the hypothesis [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3844.56s)]
*  that agronomy could be radically improved. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3850.2400000000002s)]
*  But there was no particularly strong basis, you know, ex ante to really have conviction [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3852.56s)]
*  in that. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3857.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I think it's all in the combination. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3858.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3859.2400000000002s)]
*  So, I mean, I'm curious to push further on one question that was, I mean, you asked me [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3860.2400000000002s)]
*  what I would want people to be studying. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3865.44s)]
*  Why don't you think people are studying the cost questions as much as it seems like they [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3869.16s)]
*  should be? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3877.56s)]
*  Or it seems like if these are as big of questions for society, and it certainly seems like they're [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3878.56s)]
*  issues that most people have, what are the structural barriers that are preventing the [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3884.3599999999997s)]
*  top people in these fields from deciding to go study it? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3890.68s)]
*  Is it that the fields don't line up with it? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3895.92s)]
*  Is it that there's not funding for it? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3897.6s)]
*  Is it too hard in certain ways? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3898.96s)]
*  Like, what are the dynamics that are going on here? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3900.8s)]
*  There are many big questions. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3903.92s)]
*  It's hard to study them. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3905.12s)]
*  So at the end, you have quite a speculative answer or set of hypotheses. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3906.4s)]
*  So the world as a whole isn't sure what to make of that. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3910.5s)]
*  Is it a real contribution? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3912.7200000000003s)]
*  So the private return to you as a researcher maybe is unclear. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3914.28s)]
*  So you tend to get very famous people who are quite well established, looking at really [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3918.18s)]
*  big ideas maybe a bit later in their career. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3922.28s)]
*  And I'm not saying that's bad work, but it's not necessarily cutting edge either. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3925.0s)]
*  And they've spent their whole lives being famous, and they're not necessarily in a position [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3929.02s)]
*  to actually make the breakthrough. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3932.54s)]
*  And then younger people, their incentive is to first get established and do something [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3934.48s)]
*  that is quite defensible. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3938.64s)]
*  So I think in general, big questions are understudied. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3940.8s)]
*  The tenure system, I think, increasingly is broken. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3944.64s)]
*  A lot of academics do work pretty hard. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3947.2s)]
*  But that so much of your audience is a narrowly defined set of peers who write you reference [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3949.88s)]
*  and tenure letters. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3955.32s)]
*  I think we need to change. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3956.6400000000003s)]
*  And the incentive for academics to integrate with practitioners and learn from them and [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3957.6400000000003s)]
*  actually try doing things, we need more of that. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3962.2000000000003s)]
*  I've often suggested for graduate school, instead of taking a class, everyone should [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3965.4s)]
*  be sent to a not so high income village for two weeks. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3969.2400000000002s)]
*  They can do whatever they want. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3972.6800000000003s)]
*  Just go for two weeks, think about things. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3973.84s)]
*  No one wants to do this. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3976.7000000000003s)]
*  No one wants to experiment with it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3977.94s)]
*  People who do development often do it on their own. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3979.72s)]
*  But the notion that every economist should have studied the East Asian economic miracle, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3981.9199999999996s)]
*  the Industrial Revolution, and spent two weeks or more in a poor village, it's just not how [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3986.3399999999997s)]
*  things are. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3991.24s)]
*  And I'd like to change that. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3992.24s)]
*  So how does one go about changing that? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3993.62s)]
*  So if you're trying to create a network of people who feel like they have an incentive [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=3996.14s)]
*  to study this, because it's going to be good for their career, right? [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4002.0s)]
*  And they have a network of supportive people who might be reviewing the grants or the work [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4005.08s)]
*  that they're doing and also think that this is important work to be done. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4012.9s)]
*  How do you go about establishing that? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4017.02s)]
*  I can selfishly cite that at George Mason, virtually all of our students have very directly [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4018.5s)]
*  studied these questions. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4023.3199999999997s)]
*  And we funded a lot of them to go live other distant, strange, possibly poor places. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4024.7599999999998s)]
*  Other departments may have more money than we do. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4029.9s)]
*  It can be done, because we've done it at George Mason. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4032.08s)]
*  So I think, again, it's a question of the will and just the ability and desire to imagine [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4034.92s)]
*  that things could be quite different in a sense that I think was more common in the [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4039.38s)]
*  America, say, of 1958 or JFK's decision to put a man on the moon than you see actually [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4042.96s)]
*  in 2019. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4048.76s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4049.76s)]
*  Is that a good place to wrap? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4050.76s)]
*  Fine by me. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4052.44s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNB-DX0QU8M&t=4053.44s)]
