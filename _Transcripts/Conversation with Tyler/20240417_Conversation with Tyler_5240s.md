# Peter Thiel on Political Theology  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfbndRTlsg4)
*  Hello, Peter.
*  Thank you for doing this.
*  Hello, Tyler.
*  Now, the title of this conversation is political theology.
*  That was a phrase I think first used by the Russian anarchist Bakunin to mock the Italian
*  nationalist Mazini.
*  German legal theorist Carl Schmidt then picked it up and said it's something that everyone
*  needs.
*  They all need a political theology.
*  What does the term mean to you?
*  It's a bit of a fuzzy, broad concept, but maybe to motivate it as a contrast.
*  I think that in late modernity, we're often living in this world of hyper-specialization
*  where you can't think about the big picture.
*  It's like Adam Smith's pin factory on steroids.
*  It's our world.
*  I think there is some way that we have to try to integrate all these different facets
*  of our life to try to make progress.
*  That's what political philosophy does.
*  That's what political theology does.
*  The reasons these sorts of things were abandoned.
*  I think maybe it was already the Enlightenment abandoned it.
*  One type of reason it was abandoned was because it's too hard to figure this stuff out.
*  It's just a sort of fool's errand.
*  I'm inclined to think the other reason was that it was often too dangerous, too divisive.
*  You're not supposed to have debates about religion.
*  We settled that in 1648 at the Treaty of Westphalia.
*  We're just going to forget about it and not talk about these things.
*  I think that might have been a reasonable compromise in the 18th century.
*  It's my view that when you fast forward to the 21st century, it's maybe more dangerous
*  not to think about things.
*  It's again more dangerous for us to become ever smaller cogs in an ever bigger machine
*  a la the Adam Smith pin factory.
*  And then the political dimension on it, just to say one thing on that, is there's always
*  sort of a question if we're trying to figure out something about the whole, about our whole
*  world, do you start on sort of a human scale or do you start on sort of a microscopic,
*  telescopic, atomic, or cosmic scale?
*  There's probably some way these things are related, but the political theology, political
*  philosophy debate, our frame, I think this was also Socratic, we start the sort of turn
*  to common sense, human, the world around us, questions about politics, economics, society,
*  culture, and that's sort of actually this important way to get access.
*  There's some deep link between the university and the universe.
*  There's some deep link between the failing multiversity and the crazed multiverse.
*  But the sort of political orientation I have is you're never going to solve these things
*  by, you have to start with the university or whatever that's gone wrong if you're ever
*  going to make sense of the universe and there's some analog to that that motivates all these things.
*  Let's say I'm trying to make sense of your political theology.
*  So I recall you saying in a recent talk, you consider yourself religious but not spiritual.
*  And that strikes me as quite a Calvinist point.
*  So if you put aside predestination and think of Calvinism as insisting we know nothing
*  about heaven.
*  So it's an aggregation of man's power to claim to know about heaven.
*  That's related to your critique of the left.
*  The notion that we don't know anything about heaven, it also means you can't really be
*  spiritual.
*  That's also a kind of aggregation.
*  Isn't the consistent Peter Thiel really a Calvinist thinker?
*  And Calvinism, it's quite concrete.
*  It's quite serious.
*  It takes governance and authority very literally.
*  Why aren't you just a Calvinist?
*  I'm still mostly a libertarian, Tyler.
*  But you can be both.
*  I think probably there are things, there are probably redeeming things I can find in Calvinism.
*  It's probably, it's so anti-utopian that it's probably helpful in the battle against
*  communism.
*  But I don't know if that's the only way to be anti-communist.
*  And if you do five-point Calvinism, it's total depravity, unconditional election, limited
*  atonement, irresistible grace, perseverance of the saints.
*  I don't know if I agree with even one out of those five things.
*  I would say a Gerardian anthropological frame is that there is this deep link between gods
*  and scapegoats.
*  And we tend to always, we have these scapegoats, we turn into gods, we project our violence
*  onto them.
*  And this is what archaic religion does.
*  This is in some ways what atheist liberalism does.
*  You blame everything on Mr. God.
*  And isn't Calvinism just an extreme form of scapegoating where Mr. God did everything.
*  He determined everything.
*  He's why you're wearing that blue jacket and it's why everything you did wrong, it's all
*  Mr. God's fault.
*  And it is just, it's just sort of, we should be deeply distrustful of scapegoating Mr. God
*  for everything like that.
*  So that's an anthropological argument against Calvinism.
*  And then the intellectual reason I'm not Calvinist is that I think we should be trying to make
*  sense of the world.
*  And if you are, if you're so depraved that you can't even think, which is sort of I think
*  a core Calvinist thing, we shouldn't be having a conversation.
*  So if I were a real Calvinist, we wouldn't even be able to have a conversation here.
*  And if I sort of, there's a Thomistic distinction between the intellect and the will.
*  And the Medieval's believe in the power of the intellect, the weakness, the will.
*  The modern's, it's sort of in some ways reversed.
*  But if you sort of take an effective altruist, East Bay rationalist, these people, they're
*  much closer to Calvinism.
*  They claim to be rationalists.
*  But if you're in a rationalist Bible study equivalent and the outward facing thing is
*  that you're rational and you're pure in your thinking, the inward facing thing is all just
*  spaghetti code.
*  You can never be right about anything.
*  Maybe you can be a little bit less wrong.
*  But it's, that's, and so I'm against both Calvinism and so-called rationalism.
*  But here's then the puzzle I'm faced with.
*  Let's take all of that at face value.
*  Why is it you just don't slide into Catholicism or Eastern Orthodox belief in free will?
*  There's some middle position.
*  And why is your middle position stable?
*  You could either be Catholic or for that matter Mormon, or there's plenty of room for free
*  will, right?
*  Well, again, these aren't, they're presumably not all the alternatives.
*  You know, I have, it's always a little bit of a cheap shot.
*  My two word rebuttal to Roman Catholicism is Pope Francis.
*  And, you know, and we were talking a little bit about, you know, the, you know, I grew
*  up as a Lutheran.
*  You know, there are probably all these things that are problematic about Luther.
*  There are things that were good about him.
*  But, you know, I think the one part of it that, if we judge him by the standards of
*  the 16th century, you know, I don't know, I think the Reformation had to come from the
*  outside.
*  It couldn't, it was not actually possible for it to start from within.
*  And there is a way that, you know, the Lutheran piece was, it was the less globally centralized
*  church.
*  It was going to be a less centralized church.
*  And there's probably, you know, there's probably still some part of the Protestant political
*  project that lines up more closely with a libertarian view.
*  What is it from the Hebrew Bible, or one could say Old Testament, that you've incorporated
*  into your own political thought?
*  Well, I think, I don't know, I think my views on this are pretty, fairly orthodox Christian
*  in that there's some continuity between the old and the new.
*  You know, there's some sense, it's sort of hard to define where maybe the Christian God
*  is the original progressive, where the new is better than the old.
*  I think it's the first time where the new is simply better than the old just by virtue
*  of being new.
*  But if you exaggerate the difference too much, that ends up being problematic.
*  That's sort of where you end up saying that the Old Testament God is maybe just a different
*  God from the New Testament God.
*  And that sort of all the extremely progressive forms of higher criticism, things like this,
*  in the 19th century, we're all deeply anti-Semitic.
*  So I think if you're too progressive, you end up becoming an anti-Semite.
*  And then you have to somehow say there's some progress.
*  But the Zerardian intuition I would have is it's just always this reversal in perspective
*  where the Bible takes things from the side of the victim.
*  It's already in the book of Genesis where it's the story of Cain and Abel, the founding
*  of the first city in the history of the world, is a parallel but opposite story to the story
*  of Romulus and Remus, the founding of the greatest city, where Romulus and Remus' stories
*  told from the point of view of Romulus, the Cain and Abel stories told from the point
*  of view of Abel, or the Israelites coming out of Egypt that would normally be told from
*  the point of view of the Egyptians, where you had these troublemakers and we got rid
*  of them.
*  And you have this sort of inversion of perspectives throughout the Old Testament.
*  Is it possible that we can read the Old Testament, conclude essentially history is something
*  really bad?
*  That's the central message of the woke.
*  And then just say the woke basically are correct.
*  We should side with the woke.
*  They have all these excesses.
*  Those are terrible.
*  But they're in a way a method of advertising the fundamental conclusion that history is
*  bad and they're the ones who make us deal with that.
*  And thus you and I should be woke.
*  What's wrong with that line of reasoning?
*  Yes, I think the history was very bad.
*  I think it's always a mistake for conservatives or anti-woke people to whitewash it too much.
*  And so if we say that, yeah, there used to be slavery, but the slaves were all happy
*  people, they were all happy slaves, that is a loser argument.
*  You shouldn't do this.
*  What I would say, again, the sort of rough Christian frame on this is somehow the history
*  is really bad.
*  I think Christianity probably, it is much worse than Islam or Judaism on this because,
*  I don't know, Islam and Judaism, it would be inconceivable that you could murder God
*  in the form of a person.
*  If someone claimed to be God and he got killed, that would just prove that he's not God.
*  And so, yeah, the original sin, the violence in some sense is far greater in a Christian
*  context, but then there is some way that we're all part of that matrix and you also
*  need to have forgiveness.
*  So if you want to maybe outline three rough possibilities, there's this hard to define
*  Christian in between one, which is the history is terrible and it's awful, but we need to
*  try to find a way to forgive people.
*  And then there is a, let's say, a woke version where the history is terrible, but we're going
*  to forget about the forgiveness part.
*  And then there is, I don't know, maybe sort of a right-wing Nietzschean Bronze Age pervert
*  alternative, which is we're just, you know, we're going to forget about the history.
*  It's kind of oppressive.
*  I'm sick of the skill trip and don't want to hear anything more about the history.
*  And somehow the sort of in between Christian one, I think, is the most tenable, even though
*  there are all sorts of tensions in that.
*  There was a recent Harvard talk you gave where, if I understand you correctly, you
*  suggested the left needed to learn how to relativize its victimhood.
*  What did you mean by that and how does it relate to what you just said?
*  It was in the context was, you know, how much victimhood is unhealthy for people to have.
*  And there are all these ways where you can identify yourself as a victim.
*  I don't want to have sort of blanket rule where you can never say that you weren't a
*  victim.
*  You know, I sometimes like to joke that I'm a poor and persecuted Peter person.
*  And that's maybe there are elements of truth to that.
*  Maybe it's very exaggerated.
*  But if I absolutize that too much, it's probably unhealthy and sort of a Christian division
*  that I suggested at the Harvard talk was that if it's okay to say you're a victim, it's
*  okay to do these things up to a certain point.
*  You can't say that you're a greater victim than Christ.
*  And once you do that, you've probably lost perspective.
*  Are there other holy books besides the Bible that you draw ideas and inspiration from and
*  what would those be?
*  Well, you know, I think it's probably all in some sense, it's all the great books were
*  these sort of, I don't know, they're not quite at the scale of these holy books.
*  But there was a way that we treated, you know, I don't know, Shakespeare or Cervantes or
*  Goethe as these almost semi-divine writers.
*  And I think that's the sort of attitude one has to have to read any of these books, you
*  know, appropriately and seriously.
*  So the Western canon would be your answer.
*  Something like the Western canon.
*  I don't think that, you know, I don't think the great books are quite as holy as the Bible.
*  And as a result, I probably don't read enough of them.
*  But yes, that's the closest approximation.
*  And it includes science fiction, yes or no?
*  I read a lot as a kid.
*  I read so little of that nowadays.
*  It's all too depressing.
*  Last week I was teaching my graduate class and a bunch of them asked me, why is it we
*  keep on hearing about Carl Schmitt now?
*  And I tried to explain that to them.
*  Why do you think there's now a resurgence of interest in Carl Schmitt?
*  And for you, what are the valuable insights in Schmitt?
*  You know, Carl Schmitt was one of the sort of this group of thinkers who came to prominence
*  in the 1920s in Weimar, Germany.
*  And there was, you know, obviously there were a lot of things that went, you know, very
*  haywire with many of these people, you know, that sort of in some ways Schmitt got somewhat
*  entangled with the Nazis, who distanced himself a few years later, but there was some very
*  bad judgment in certain ways.
*  But the thing that I think is interesting, dangerous about looking at the Weimar thinkers,
*  it was somehow in the aftermath of World War I, Germany had lost, you couldn't go back
*  to sort of the throne and altar, you know, empire of the Habsburgs, and you couldn't,
*  you didn't really want to go forward with liberal democracy.
*  And so there were all these people who had these fairly deep critiques.
*  And in some ways, it was going back to these questions of political theology, political
*  philosophy that had been sort of whitewashed and set aside since the enlightenment.
*  And again, there were things about that were dangerous, you know, sort of one way to think
*  of the Weimar period was, I don't know, it's like the dwarves in Moria where they
*  dwelled too deep and finally they awakened the nameless terror of the Walrach.
*  But I think there are, I don't think we're ever in a cyclical world, but there are certainly
*  certain parallels in the US in the 2020s to Germany in the 1920s where, you know, liberalism
*  is exhausted, one suspects that democracy, whatever that means, is exhausted.
*  And, you know, that we have to ask some questions very far outside the open window.
*  What is it you think that Schmidt missed that's very important?
*  Let's, maybe I'll just sort of do one insight that I think is powerful and then sort of
*  what's wrong about that.
*  You know, one of his books was The Concept of the Political and sort of what defines politics
*  and it's sort of this, it's some of this division of friends and enemies and that somehow is
*  really foundational and you shouldn't get sidetracked with all these other things.
*  And then there are all these interesting ways you could apply this.
*  There's, you know, sort of a 1980s Reagan coalition question.
*  I always like to ask people where you had this, you know, the Reagan coalition was somehow
*  the free market libertarians, the defense hawks, and the social conservatives.
*  And so if you ask what does the millionaire and the general and the priest, what do they
*  actually have in common?
*  We just sort of imagine these three people are seated at a dinner table and they're having
*  dinner and what do they actually talk about?
*  And it's really hard to come up with an answer and yet the coalition worked incredibly well.
*  And the answer I submit that they have in common is they're anti-communist and they
*  have a common enemy and that was incredibly powerful.
*  It was in some ways my formative political ideas as a teenager, you know, junior high
*  school, high school, late 70s, early 80s was anti-communism.
*  And then there was a way that, you know, when the Berlin Wall came down in 89, this seemingly
*  incredibly powerful political consolation disintegrated and there's sort of a natural
*  Schmittian analysis of this.
*  So that's sort of where I find Schmitt quite powerful as a thinker.
*  The place where it probably tends to always go haywire is there's always a question whether
*  politics is like a market or is it a sort of thing where if you understand it better
*  it works better?
*  Or is it something like a scapegoating machine where the scapegoating machine only works
*  if you don't look into the sausage making factory.
*  And so if you say we're having a lot of conflicts in our village and we have to find some random
*  elderly woman and accuse her of witchcraft so that we'll achieve some psychosocial unity
*  as a village, this sort of thing doesn't really work if you're that self-aware.
*  And so Schmitt in a way had this optimistic enlightenment rationality to it where if we
*  just describe politics as the arbitrary division of the world into friends and enemies, then
*  this will somehow strengthen the political and it probably actually in some ways accelerated
*  its disintegration instead.
*  Is Schmitt missing out on a certain possible cyclicality in history?
*  So the notion that liberalism will collapse in the Weimar Germany of the 1920s, obviously
*  that was the correct prediction.
*  But if you reappear in West Germany of 1948, it was a completely incorrect prediction.
*  And just as well liberalism had collapsed leading up to World War I, it tends to come
*  back.
*  Why isn't the cyclical perspective the correct one?
*  Man, that's a big question.
*  I don't know.
*  I think you can stress the aspects that are timeless and eternal.
*  I prefer to stress the aspects that are one time and world historical.
*  I think that in some sense every moment in history only happens once.
*  And I think there is some kind of a meaning to history.
*  I think it has a certain type of linearity to it.
*  And I think that is sort of the Judeo-Christian view of history as distinct from let's say
*  the classical Greco-Roman one.
*  I don't know if you can have a concept of history that's cyclical.
*  So if you look at Thucydides where it's this great period of peace that leads to this great
*  war between Athens and Sparta.
*  So the Periclean Age, some of them gives way to this great conflict.
*  And people came back to studying Thucydides right after World War I because there was
*  some certain parallel, a hundred years of peace between the Napoleonic Wars and then
*  led to this great conflict.
*  But there's nothing particular in the history.
*  None of the details matter in Thucydides.
*  He makes up all the speeches and so on.
*  And then you contrast this with something like the book of Daniel in the Bible where
*  it's a succession of four kingdoms and it is a one time world history where everything
*  that happens is unique, not to be repeated.
*  And there's sort of a sense in which I would say the real first historian was Daniel and
*  Thucydides isn't even close.
*  And then we talked off the set a little bit about what about the Roman Empire and the
*  Holy Roman Empire and isn't the European Union sort of like the Roman Empire?
*  And then my response is well, we have nuclear weapons today and they didn't have those even
*  in 1900.
*  And so even just on the science and tech arc, things are so different and I would not trivialize
*  the importance of science and technology.
*  So you think now the stakes are too high for the cyclical version of history to work because
*  at some point it's just not possible to come back?
*  It's just that the science and tech has a progressive character.
*  And so it is, yes, there are elements I think that are probably quite apocalyptic about
*  our time, but I wouldn't, I would just start by saying they're very different and we're
*  in a very different world than we were in 1900 and I don't know how you go, I don't
*  know how you unlearn all the knowledge we've gained even since 1900.
*  Do you think we're entering a new age of millenarian thought, somewhat akin to the English 17th
*  century?
*  Everything was very fertile, there's a scientific revolution, tech you could say is revitalized
*  again, a lot of people went crazy, highly diverse theologies, they execute a king, many
*  strange things happen, but in many ways we're living in the world of the English 17th century,
*  right, with constitutions, political parties, central banks.
*  Is this the new millenarian age?
*  This is again like an absurdly cyclical frame you're putting on things.
*  It's just, no, I don't think any moment ever repeats itself, it is just radically different.
*  Of course there are things that are apocalyptic about our world, we have all these kinds of
*  dangers that unlike the 17th century, they seem to come from this place that's very
*  non-religious, it's like science, technology, it was nuclear weapons after 1945, maybe it's
*  environmental degradation, climate change, we can debate various forms of the environment,
*  there certainly are fears people have about bio weapons, we can ask what really happened
*  with the Wuhan lab, there are apocalyptic fears around AI that I think deserve to be
*  taken seriously.
*  So, yeah, if it's millenarian or apocalyptic, it has a very, very different feel, it's sort
*  of apocalyptic violence that comes from a purely human source, it's not really being
*  orchestrated by God.
*  One of the points that René Girard always liked to make was that in the Catholic church,
*  I think during the Advent season, you'd often have these sort of sermons on the end times
*  and the terrible things that happened at the end of the world, and Girard's telling the
*  church to stop those sermons after 1945 because people needed to be reassured that the nuclear
*  weapons had nothing to do with Armageddon or fire and brimstone or anything like this,
*  even though of course there were all these slight mythic elements, the first nuclear
*  test was called Trinity, you named it after all these Greek gods, Saturn, Jupiter, Zeus,
*  but yeah, I think we are, there are elements of that that I think are very true, but if
*  I do my anti-millenarian frame, or maybe it's not a pro-tech argument, this is sort of an
*  anti-anti-tech argument, is that if we again talk about all these existential risks today
*  and nuclear weapons, climate change, biotech, nanotech, killer robots, the AI that's going
*  to turn everyone into a paperclip or whatever, I always think you have to, you should at
*  least include one more kind of existential risk if we're going to throw it in, and in
*  my mind one other existential risk is a one world totalitarian government, and I find
*  that at least as scary as the others, and in sort of a biblical eschatological context,
*  you're supposed to worry about Armageddon, you're also supposed to worry about the Antichrist,
*  maybe you're supposed to worry more about the Antichrist because the Antichrist comes
*  first, and so if we're going to find a pathway through this apocalyptic age, you have to
*  navigate between the sill of all these existential risks and the cryptos of the political totalitarian
*  catastrophe. If I had to do a more literary version on this, it's very hard to write a
*  literary account of the Antichrist, but the two good Antichrist books that were written,
*  the two best fictional ones in my mind were pre-World War I, there was 1908 Robert Hugh
*  Benson's sort of Catholic book Lord of the World, there was a 1900 one by Soloviev, War
*  Progress and the End of History, they both had these sort of accounts of this future
*  totalitarian world dictator who took over the whole world, and in both of them it's
*  kind of a daemonium ex machina, it's sort of really unclear how the Antichrist takes
*  over, it's like he gives these hypnotic speeches and no one can remember what he says, but
*  they all just sell their souls for no apparent good reason whatsoever and he just takes over
*  the world. But it seems to me that if we were to write, if one were to try to write
*  a novel like this post 1945, it's very straightforward, it would be like One World or None, this was
*  a short film by the nuclear scientists after 1945, if we don't give the nuclear weapons
*  to the one world government it's going to blow up the whole world, and basically the
*  literary version would be that the Antichrist comes to power by constantly talking about
*  Armageddon and constantly telling us scary millenarian stories, and so that's sort of
*  my complicated nuanced answer is there's a lot of truth to these existential risks, I
*  don't want to completely dismiss them, but that's also how we're going to get this totalitarian
*  state, if you look at all these versions, I can go down, but it's like, do you want
*  to worry about Dr. Strangelove or Greta, and it seems like Dr. Strangelove is more dangerous,
*  but if everyone's going to have to ride a bicycle, that's not just going to happen on
*  its own, and that requires some real enforcement of this stuff, or there's a short boss fight
*  from 2019 on how to stop all the AI risks, and it's basically, maybe we can change the
*  culture so that nobody will have heterodox ideas anymore, and so a few different ideas
*  like this, but then what you really need is really effective global government and really
*  effective policing, because you have to have some kind of global compute governance, and
*  that sounds to me at least as scary as the AI.
*  But isn't the much greater risk a collapse into a kind of disorderly feudalism? So where
*  in Florida the United States seems to be becoming more federalistic, it's very hard for me to
*  imagine China, say, taking over India, you can look at the Balkans, it's even a word,
*  Balkanized, you look at the Middle East, if it goes very badly, it's hard to see any single
*  power just ruling any substantial part of the Middle East, it's easy to imagine it
*  being in a kind of chaos, why think there's so much scale that that kind of totalitarianism
*  would be possible?
*  Man I don't know, it's, there's so many different versions of this, but just if we think about,
*  if we think about, I don't know, the version of this I would have been more on your side,
*  let's say post 9-11, it was, wow, aren't we just going to have all this chaotic terrorism
*  all over the world? And we didn't get that much terrorism, and we instead got the Patriot
*  Act and incredible tracking of money flows, incredible monitoring of people, and the fact
*  that we're talking about the anti-Christ people, and so the, and of course there's
*  still, there's still things that can go wrong, but the political slogan of the anti-Christ,
*  first Thessalonians 5-3 I think, is peace and safety, and it seems that we've gone far
*  more in the peace and safety direction than the global chaos direction, I don't know,
*  I think it's hard to even have like an illegal Swiss bank account, and that's like a really
*  modest, modest way, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's hard to exit, it's much harder
*  to exit the United States than it was, you know, 20, 30 years ago.
*  Let's say you're trying to track the probability that the western world and its allies somehow
*  muddles through and just keeps on muddling through. What variable or variables do you
*  look at to try to track or estimate that? What do you watch?
*  I don't think it's a really empirical question. So this is, it's, it's, if, if, yes, if you
*  could convince me that it was empirical and you'd say these are the variables we should
*  pay attention to, if I, if I could, if I agreed with that frame, you've already won half the
*  argument, and so it would be like variables, well, you know, the sun has risen and set
*  every day, and so it'll probably keep doing that, and so we shouldn't worry. Or, you know,
*  the planet has always muddled through, so Greta's kind of wrong, and, you know, and
*  we shouldn't really pay attention to her. And I'm sympathetic to not paying attention
*  to her, but I don't think this is a great argument. And, and, or, you know, this is,
*  of course, if we think about the globalization project of, of, you know, of, of the post-Cold
*  War period, where in some sense it's, you know, globalization is just sort of happens,
*  there's going to be more movement of goods and people and ideas and, and money, and we're
*  going to sort of become this, you know, more peaceful, better integrated world, and you
*  don't need to sweat the details, we're just going to kind of muddle through. And then
*  what, you know, in my telling, you know, there were a lot of things around that story that,
*  that went very haywire. You know, one, one simple version is the, the US-China thing.
*  It hasn't quite worked the way people in Fukuyama and all these people envisioned it back in
*  1989. And, and I think one could have figured this out much earlier. And, and if, if, if
*  we had not been told, you, you can just, you're just going to muddle through, it would, it,
*  you know, the alarm bells would have gone off much sooner. And, you know, maybe, maybe
*  globalization is leading towards, you know, sort of a neoliberal paradise. Maybe it's
*  leading to the totalitarian state of the Antichrist. But I would be, I'd be, let's say it's not
*  a very empirical argument, but, but if someone like you didn't ask questions about muddling
*  through, I'd be so much like an optimistic boomer libertarian like you. Stopped asking
*  questions about muddling through. I'd be so much more assured. So are you, so much more
*  hopeful. Are you saying it's ultimately a metaphysical question rather than an empirical
*  question? I don't, I don't think it's metaphysical, but it's, it's somewhat analytic. And moral
*  even. It's, it's. That you're laying down some duty by talking about muddling through.
*  Well, it's, it's, it does tie into all these bigger questions. So I think, I don't think
*  if we had, you know, a one world state that this would automatically be for the best.
*  And so there are, you know, there are, you know, I'm not sure that, you know, if we do
*  a classical liberal or libertarian intuition on this, it would be, you know, maybe, maybe
*  the absolute power that a one world state would have would corrupt absolutely. I don't
*  think the libertarians were critical enough of it the last 20 or 30 years. So there was
*  some way they didn't believe their own theories. They didn't connect things enough. I don't
*  know if I'd say that's a moral failure, but there was some failure of the, of the imagination.
*  So this multi-pronged skepticism about muddling through, would you say that's your actual
*  political theology? Like, have we gotten to the bottom of this now?
*  That would be, that would be a, you know, it's, it's, it's whenever people think you
*  can just muddle through, yeah, you're probably set up for some kind of disaster. That's,
*  that's fair. I mean, it doesn't, it's not like, not as positive an agenda, but, but
*  I always, I always think, you know, I know, as a, as a, you know, it's one of my chapters
*  in the zero to one book was, was, you know, you're not a lottery ticket and sort of like
*  the basic advice is if you're, if you're an investor and, you know, you can just think,
*  okay, I'm just muddling through as an investor here. I have no idea what to invest in. There
*  are all these people. I don't, I can't pay attention to any of them. I'm just going to
*  write checks to everyone, make them go away. And I'm just going to set up, you know, a
*  desk somewhere here in, on South Beach and I'm going to give a check to everyone who
*  comes up to the desk or, you know, not everybody, but I'll just, it'll, it's just, I'm writing
*  lottery tickets and that's just a formula for losing all your money. And, and there's
*  some, there's some, the, the muddling, the, the place where I react so violently to the
*  muddling through is it's just, it's again, we're, we're just not thinking. And this is
*  like, it's, it's, it can be Calvinist. It can be, it can be rationalist. It's, it's
*  anti-intellectual. It's, it's not thinking about things.
*  So the muddling through view and the Calvinist view, in your opinion, they have the same
*  flaw, actually. It's a distrust in human agency, a distrust in human thought, a distrust, you
*  know, in our ability to, yeah, to, to make choices.
*  Now for months, I've been asking myself why you and also Schmidt are so interested in
*  this catacomb idea, which is also from the Bible. You can explain that to us in a moment,
*  but am I correct in now thinking, it just occurs to me that the catacomb is in a sense
*  your substitute vision for what for me is muddling through. So you're not willing to
*  believe in muddling through, but things haven't collapsed now, not here. So you need something
*  else holding the finger in the dike, and that's catacomb, or no?
*  Well, it's, it's a very mysterious idea. I'm not, it's, it's sort of this, this, there's
*  always a question why the Antichrist hasn't taken over yet, and it's this mysterious force
*  that holds back, this restraining force that holds back, you know, the totalitarian one-world
*  state. And, and, you know, I don't necessarily put too much stock in it, because it's, it's
*  sort of, on its own terms, it's somewhat unstable, it's, it's provisional, it has these sort
*  of archaic, sacred elements, it can, it can work for a while, it's, but it's not something,
*  it's not a, you can't identify it with an institution. You know, and again, the, the
*  Schmidian view is there were all these different things that played the role of the catacomb
*  at various points in time, but if you're not supposed to immanentize the eschaton, you're
*  also not supposed to immanentize the catacomb. And, and so if you, if you, if you identify
*  too much as one thing, that can go very wrong. And then if you, if you think of the catacomb
*  as the thing that restrains the one-world state, there were, you know, there were various
*  things that restrains the Antichrist. Anything that's sort of like the opposite, this is
*  sort of a Gerardian cut, is always going to be memetically entangled, and so it's going
*  to have sort of this parallelism. And so there's always a risk that the catacomb becomes the
*  Antichrist. The original Antichrist, the proto-Antichrist was Nero, Claudius, the good emperor was
*  the catacomb, he was restraining Nero, but then at some point, you know, Nero's the opposite
*  of Claudius, but they're both, they're both Roman emperors. Or, or you know, you could
*  say that, you could say that in the middle of the 20th century, I don't know, from, let's
*  say 1949 to 1989, I would identify the catacomb as anti-communism, I would identify communism
*  as the ideology of the Antichrist in the 20th century. And anti-communism was this, you
*  know, it was not, what stopped communism was not, you know, the United States couldn't
*  have done it, it was not just one country, it was not, it was not like some libertarian
*  debating society, it was, you know, something that was like pretty violent, pretty, pretty
*  hard to morally justify, not really that Christian, but, but that sort of had this
*  unifying effect. And then the way it morphed would be, you know, 1989, something like anti-communism
*  morphs into neoliberalism, and that's actually, you know, well, if you're anti-communist,
*  you're not aspiring for world control, you're just trying to stop the communists from getting
*  world control. Once you've defeated the communists, what are you supposed to do? And like, maybe
*  we can just go home and forget about all of what you did. But in practice, these things
*  have a tendency to perpetuate themselves, and it was like Bush 41, anti-communism became
*  the New World Order, and we're now going to just govern the world in the name of anti-communism.
*  And so there's something about it that's always misleading, or even what I said about the
*  Antichrist and this apocalyptic thing. Doesn't the Antichrist just come to power by acting
*  as a catacomb? This is what Greta says she's doing. She is the catacomb stopping climate
*  change. And so it's, yeah, it's a somewhat useful concept, but I wouldn't put too much
*  weight on it.
*  So at the macro level, all the weight you're putting on human agency, is that really so
*  compatible with Lutheranism?
*  I'm probably not. I'm not a perfect Lutheran. There's a lot, there's a lot that was, that
*  all these people, one would judge very differently in retrospect.
*  If you look in the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, and you think about all the Christian
*  thinkers who believed in some form of predestination, or Moses was chosen and the like, Abraham
*  was chosen, what is it in the Bible that points you in the direction of so much belief in
*  human agency being so important?
*  There's sort of a lot of different levels on this, but certainly if you think of it
*  as this shift away from sacrificing individuals, sacrificing people, there is sort of an anti,
*  the anti-sacrificial theme. And you can always say, how is modernity or enlightened values,
*  how are they tied with this? But certainly the idea I would have would be something like
*  the idea of the individual came out of this context where the state was not absolute,
*  it was not not sacred, it was not necessarily providential.
*  This is always, Girard liked to always say that Christ was the first political atheist,
*  because on the level of the political order, if you say, Christ says that he's the son
*  of God, the son of the father, there's a way you can go into Trinitarian metaphysics, but
*  the political interpretation of this is that Caesar Augustus, the son of the divinized
*  Caesar, is not, somehow that's not exactly the son of God, but the son of the son of
*  God, and that the Roman Empire is not simply divinely ordained, and then that somehow opens
*  a space for a less unitary system that takes many many centuries to develop or something
*  like this. But this is where, I don't know, I think of even Ayn Rand is like a pretty
*  good Christian in this way. I know that would probably be really scandalous
*  to say that.
*  But it's just, it's at least, you know, yes, it's Jewish and atheist and shrill and crazy,
*  but it's just, you can't sacrifice the individual. And then, you know, you shouldn't sacrifice
*  your mind, you shouldn't sacrifice your reason, it's just that you can't sacrifice that.
*  You've been quoting the Tempest lately in some of your talks. How is it you think the
*  Shakespearean political vision differs from the Christian?
*  Well, it's always hard to know what Shakespeare really thought, but I, you know, you certainly
*  have different characters. If you have, you know, I think it's, you know, if you have
*  a vision like Macbeth, I think, says life is a tale told by an idiot full of sound
*  and fury signifying nothing. So that doesn't sound like a particularly Christian worldview,
*  but maybe, you know, that's what Macbeth says, it's not what Shakespeare says. So it's always
*  very hard to know, or maybe it's a sort of a Christian nihilistic view of the world or
*  something like that. But I think the contrast I always frame is that I think, you know,
*  the way I understand Shakespeare is always in contrast with someone like Karl Marx, where
*  Marx believed that people had battles over differences that mattered. It was, you know,
*  the different classes and they had objectively different interests and this is what led to
*  the intensity of the struggle. And there's something in Shakespeare that's sort of proto-Gerardian
*  or very mimetic where people have conflicts over, when they, the conflicts are the most
*  intense when they don't differ at all. And so it is, you know, it's the opening line
*  of Romeo and Juliet, it's the Capulets versus the Montagues, two houses alike in dignity,
*  they're identical and that's why they hate each other so much. Or I think it's at the
*  end of Hamlet where Hamlet says, you know, to be truly great you must stake everything
*  for an eggshell because an average person would fight over things that mattered, but
*  a truly great person would fight over things as ephemeral as honor or an eggshell or something
*  like this. And of course, you know, Hamlet's problem is he doesn't really believe all the,
*  you know, the sort of insane revenge drama he's supposed to be in. So I think there is
*  probably a place where I would say, yes, Shakespeare would probably be very distrustful of, you
*  know, extreme ideological differences today, that would probably in some ways also be,
*  be a kind of political atheist.
*  I find the play Julius Caesar very interesting because there's no catacombs, there's no muddling
*  through so they sacrifice Caesar, there's a civil war and a lot more people dying and
*  no end to that insight. It's the pessimistic scenario of the teal mental universe, I think.
*  You know, there's sort of a strange way where they're all going back and thinking they're
*  reenacting things, right? So it's, you know, the way Brutus gets pulled into the conspiracy
*  in Julius Caesar is that he gets reminded that, you know, his ancestor, another person
*  named Brutus had overthrown Tarquin, the last of the kings of Rome in 509 BC. So he thinks
*  he's just, you know, reenacting that murder. And then of course there's a, you know, there's
*  a, I think there is some part in the play where Shakespeare has the actors say, you
*  know, I'm going to get this slightly garbled, but it's something like, you know, and centuries
*  hence there'll be people reenacting this on a stage in front of an audience. And this
*  is what motivates Brutus to do it. It's like the future applause in the Shakespearean theater.
*  And then of course, you know, the crazy literal reenactment of it was John Wolkes Booth shooting
*  Abraham Lincoln in 1865 where, you know, Booth was a Shakespearean actor and then it was
*  Six Semper Tyrannus was what he said. It was like he thought he was reenacting the Brutus
*  Caesar thing. And then you can look at the, I think it's 1838 Lincoln speech, the young
*  men's Lyceum address where Lincoln sort of portrays himself sort of in a somewhat coded
*  way as sort of a proto Caesar where, you know, they're, and he sort of tells the audience
*  there are people in this country who, you know, who wouldn't be happy to be, you know,
*  there are all these, some people are like really ambitious and, but no one could be
*  like a founder because that was in the past. And the most you can now be as a president.
*  But there are people for whom being president is not enough. And there's some people who,
*  if you didn't stop them, they would keep going until they enslaved all the white people or
*  freed all the slaves. This is sort of Lincoln talking about himself and saying that he has
*  the ambition to be like a Caesar or Napoleon or something like this. But yeah, so there's
*  sort of a bit of a roundabout answer. So yes, so there are ways we can see it as a cycle,
*  but surely that's what we want to transcend. It was a bad idea for Brutus to think he was
*  reenacting the Caesar thing. And somehow there was something about the John Wilkes Booth
*  story that's pretty sad too.
*  For our last segment, let's turn to artificial intelligence. As you know, large language
*  models are already quite powerful. They're only going to get better. In this world to
*  come, will the word cells just lose their influence? People who write, people who play
*  around with ideas, pundits, are they just toast? What's this going to look like? Are
*  they going to give up power peacefully? Are they going to go down with the ship? Are they
*  going to...
*  Set off nuclear bombs?
*  I had this rift where I think, again, one of the things... I'll say the AI thing broadly,
*  the LLMs, it's a big breakthrough. It's very important. And it's striking to me how bad
*  Silicon Valley is at talking about these sorts of things. And there's sort of all kinds of...
*  The questions are either way too narrow where it's something like, we're going to have...
*  Is the next transformer model going to improve by 20% on the last one or something like this?
*  Or they're maybe too cosmic where it's like we go straight... From there we go straight
*  to the simulation theory of the universe. And surely there are a lot of in-between questions
*  one could ask. Let me try to answer yours. My intuition would be it's going to be quite
*  the opposite where it seems much worse for the math people than the word people. And
*  what people have told me is that they think within three to five years the AI models will
*  be able to solve all the US Math Olympiad problems. And that would shift things quite a bit.
*  There's sort of a longer history I always have on the math versus verbal rift where if you ask,
*  when did our society bias to testing people more for a math ability? I believe it was during the
*  French Revolution because it was believed that verbal ability ran in families. Math ability was
*  sort of distributed in the sort of idiots of way throughout the population. And so if we
*  prioritized math ability, it had sort of this meritocratic but also egalitarian effect on society.
*  And then I think by the time you get to the Soviet Union and Soviet communism in the 20th
*  century where you give a number theorist or chess grandmaster a medal, which I was somewhat
*  sympathetic to in the Soviet Union, maybe it's actually just sort of a control mechanism where
*  the math people are singularly clueless. They don't understand anything. But if we put them on a
*  pedestal and tell everyone else you need to be like the math person, then it's actually a way to
*  the chess grandmaster doesn't understand anything about the world. That's a way to really control
*  things. And if I sort of fast forwarded to let's say Silicon Valley in the early 21st century,
*  it's way too biased towards the math people. I don't know if it's a French Revolution thing
*  or a Russian sort of Straussian secret cabal control thing where you have to prioritize it.
*  That's the thing that seems deeply unstable and that's what I would bet on getting reversed.
*  The place where math ability, it's the thing that's the test for everything. It's like if
*  you want to go to medical school, we weed people out through physics and calculus. I'm not sure
*  that's really correlated with your dexterity as a neurosurgeon. I don't really want someone
*  operating on my brain to be doing prime number factorizations in their head while they're
*  operating on my brain or something like that. In the late 80s, early 90s, I had a chess bias
*  because I was a pretty good chess player. My chess bias was you should just test everyone on
*  chess ability and that should be the gating factor. Why even do math? Why not just chess?
*  That got undermined by the computers in 1997. Isn't that what's going to happen to math?
*  Isn't that a long overdue rebalancing of our society?
*  How is manual labor going to do in this world to come? There will be a lot more new projects.
*  If you're a very good gardener, carpenter, will your wages go up by 5X? Is there something else
*  in store for us? It's hard to say. Let me suggest some of the questions I'd like us to focus on
*  more with AI. I think one question is how much will it increase GDP versus how much will it
*  increase inequality? Probably it does some of both. Is it a very centralizing technology?
*  That's another question I'd like to get a better handle on. I had this riff five,
*  six years ago where if crypto is libertarian, why can't we say that AI is communist? One of
*  the things that I'm still probably a little bit uncomfortable about is that it seems to lead to
*  these incredible returns to scale. I thought San Francisco had at least committed suicide and we
*  could move on from San Francisco. The returns to scale on AI are so big that maybe even San
*  Francisco will survive with the AI revolution. There are benefits to this, but it also leads to
*  this kind of a set of centralization questions or the geopolitical question. If it is as big a
*  technology as you and I think it is, what is it going to do to the China-U.S. rivalry?
*  What do you think? I'm just saying it would be good if we at least asked the right sorts of
*  questions. I don't have answers to all these. I'll do the pro-China argument. They will not
*  hesitate to use the AI and train it on all their people, so it'll be more quickly implemented.
*  Pro-U.S. argument is that we are probably ahead of China. Maybe the large language models are
*  not really communist. Maybe if you can't ask the large language model who Winnie the Pooh is,
*  you have to nerf it so badly that it doesn't even work or something like that. There's an
*  intuition that the effect of altruists are not just fifth columnists on the part of the CCP where
*  they're trying to sabotage us, but where they actually simply are doing what the CCP wants,
*  which is actually to stop the LLMs and that it's very disruptive. Then to the extent,
*  I think the second one that it probably helps the U.S. more than China is that actually massively
*  destabilizing where China was this sort of low volatility plan to victory where they were just
*  going to slowly beat the Western world. If you now have this volatility increasing technology
*  that China cannot match, does that just accelerate China's timetable? Does China become sort of like
*  Russia where you're ultimately going to lose and maybe you have to invade Taiwan in the next year
*  or two and you can't wait for another decade? Final question. What is the next thing you will
*  choose to learn about? Man, this is always, these are all these questions, you know, this is all,
*  there's all these projections of your personality, Tyler, you know, it's like, and it's the Isaiah
*  Berlin thing where, you know, you have these two, you have these sort of, you know, the hedgehog who
*  knows one thing, the fox who knows many things, you know so many different things, your interest
*  in so many different things, you know, I'm just, I don't know, it's just sort of a few core ideas I
*  come back to and it's something like this, you know, wonderful and terrible history of the world
*  that we're living through as, you know, you know, Christianity's unraveling our culture and we have
*  to figure out a way to get to the other side and I think that's what's going to keep me busy for a
*  long time. Peter Thiel, thank you very much.
*  We now have time for questions. Yes? Hello, it's kind of a basic question maybe to you but to me
*  I'm wondering your opinion. You have this dystopic view of like one world order which I totally
*  understand and I know that Founders Fund has invested in cryptocurrency and made money on it
*  but do you view crypto or bitcoin in particular as something that could put power back in the
*  hands of the people or something that's likely to catalyze more centralization of power in this
*  one world order in the future? I'm still hopeful that on net bitcoin is on the anti one world order
*  side just based on all the people who are against it but maybe that's a little bit too of a simplistic
*  Schmittian analysis but yeah, no, there are the questions are, you know, the sort of questions
*  would be can you, do you have genuine anonymity, genuine pseudonymity and probably there are certain
*  ways in which, you know, if we want to have decentralized things where you use money for
*  questionable purposes, you know, maybe physical cash is still better than bitcoin and things
*  have not gone quite the sort of, I don't know, crypto anarchist utopia that people were
*  fantasizing about in the late 90s. On the other hand, you know, I think it probably is still,
*  you know, if you're just, you know, thinking of it as a, you know, one-time way to get money outside of
*  the control of a particular government, it's probably still extremely good for that.
*  Thank you. So you can hodl until you need it. Next question. So Nick Bostrom and
*  communism both sort of start out with a very different premise, end up in the same place,
*  we need a one world government. Do you think that there's some sort of metaphysical reason for that,
*  some kind of attractor well there? I think there's a certain rationality to it. If we,
*  maybe just enlightenment rationality where if we say that there's, you know, some set of things
*  that make sense and that are good and then, you know, it's probably, there's some kind of a way
*  you should have, you know, world order. It sounds more peaceful in both cases than having, you know,
*  a divided world. But yeah, there's probably just some kind of a rationality where if you had one
*  modality of governance that would, if it's the best, that would make for the best possible world.
*  You should have that everywhere. And then if you have, it's only if you have, you know, some very
*  deep concerns about, you know, maybe human nature or the people who run the government or things
*  like that that you start to second guess that. They're probably both, you know, somehow pretty
*  optimistic about human nature. If one extra year at the end of your life was for sale,
*  what would you be willing to pay for it today? Man, I don't agree with hypothetical questions
*  where I don't believe in the premise. I would probably not pay the person who asked me that
*  anything because I think they were just ripping me off since it's a, I don't, you know, I hope to
*  live for more than just one more year. And by the time I needed to collect on that extra year,
*  I think that person would be long gone. All right, cool. Thanks.
*  What are the Straussian messages of the Bible and what do they tell us about political theology?
*  Simple questions tonight. Oh boy.
*  Well, I think Strauss was this political philosopher who's, you know, I wouldn't describe
*  as Christian, was probably sort of very, very classical. But the place where I'd say both,
*  let's say someone like Strauss and Girard agreed on was that there's certain ways of understanding
*  the world that have this disruptive way. And, you know, you don't want enlightenment simply,
*  that if you just tell people the secret messages, it has a sort of unraveling effect. And so the,
*  I don't know, I'm not sure it's esoteric, but it is, you know, it's the book of revelations,
*  is the apocalypse because, you know, apocalypse in Greek means unveiling. And it is, and if you
*  unveil the social order, you might end up, you know, deconstructing and destroying it. And,
*  you know, this is, you know, one of Girard's book was, I see Satan fall like lightning. And it's
*  sort of to see Satan is to see Satan fall. So the only time Satan appears in the Bible is at the
*  very end of the world. Every other time, it's maybe he's talking to God or he's talking to Christ in
*  the desert, but no human being ever sees Satan simply because to see Satan is to see Satan fall.
*  You know, it's sort of the, you know, there's sort of the libertarian, you know, another libertarian
*  cut on Christianity is that, you know, when Christ is tempted in the desert and Satan says,
*  just worship me and you can have all these kingdoms in the world, it's somehow saying that all the
*  governments are more satanic than divinely ordained. And then people don't understand that
*  they think the governments are somehow divinely ordained. And so once you see how satanic the
*  government is, how satanic taxes are, other things besides the governments do, it will have this
*  unraveling effect. Thank you. Hi. A big part of the thesis of the sovereign individual is that
*  the defenders will be able to have an advantage over offense and that that's the way that
*  violence and the exertion of force is going. I'm interested if you still think that to be the case,
*  particularly with companies like Indero, where the thesis is kind of there is no inherent properties
*  of a smaller weapon that a smaller state can easily have, but rather the proliferation of those
*  is simply a tactic that larger states need to use to evolve their strategies.
*  Yeah, so I was extremely influenced by the Rhys Mark Davidson book, 1997, The Sovereign Individual,
*  where the thesis was that, let's say, the computer technology information age was trending in this
*  very deeply decentralizing libertarian way. And that seemed very true in 1999. And then certainly
*  by the end of the 2010s, one would have said that there's something about a lot of information
*  technology that seemed maybe centralizing, maybe the opposite. There's always a riff I have on this
*  where if we look at, there's a Star Trek or the world of 1968, people also thought 2001 Space
*  Odyssey, IBM is how, you're going to have one big supercomputer that's going to run a planet,
*  or the planet Beta, in one of the early Star Trek episodes where there's one big supercomputer
*  that runs the planet. The inhabitants are sort of these docile robot-like people who've been living
*  peacefully but uneventfully for 8,000 years. And then of course, as always, the Star Trek people
*  don't follow the prime director and blow up the computer and then leave the planet.
*  But the future of the computer age in the late 60s was highly centralized. By the late 90s,
*  it was very decentralized. By the late 2010s, maybe crypto accepted, it was again,
*  seemed to be pushing back to centralization. My intuition is these things are not absolutely
*  written in stone. It's up to us to work on making the technologies happen to push it one way or the
*  other. As a follow-up, would you bet on open source AI? If decentralization is great, it should
*  have more dynamic properties, should innovate more, should be safer, as many other virtues.
*  I don't quite know if that's the main variable that's going to push the centralization or
*  decentralization with it. But yeah, there's probably some version of it that would be helpful.
*  The Linux versus Microsoft precedent, not sure that changed anything that much on the
*  level of the operating system. Thank you.
*  When do you think humans are going to destroy themselves and do you think AI is going to do it?
*  I don't think these things are written in stone. I'm not a Calvinist. I'm not a P-Doom EA
*  East Bay rationalist. I think it's up to us. But as I said, I'm much more worried about
*  the humans trying to stop the AI than the AI destroying us. A force that's powerful enough
*  to stop the AI is probably a force that's powerful enough to destroy the world too.
*  So I want to worry more about the humans that are trying to stop the AI.
*  Ayaan Hirsi Ali recently converted to Christianity, but it seems mostly for utilitarian reasons.
*  Something like for the great civilizational war because secularism doesn't provide a good enough
*  answer. Do you see religion as mainly a utility in the postmodern world?
*  You can have utilitarian elements. I don't think one can ever stress those too much.
*  My bias is always to focus more on questions of truth.
*  You mentioned Lincoln's Lyceum address where he talks about that towering genius figure.
*  Did you think at the time he thought he was the towering genius?
*  Do you approve of Lincoln's political religion or view for America?
*  I think it's a very fascinating speech because he references some Caesar or Napoleon-like figure
*  who will enslave the white people or free the slaves. It seems plausible to think that he was
*  thinking of himself. I have a question about your personal life if I may. If you could give your
*  answers a story, that would be lovely. Obviously you feel a great sense of personal responsibility,
*  indeed responsibility to history. How did that sentiment begin? How has it evolved? What have
*  you found to be the more fruitful and less fruitful avenues for expressing it?
*  I'm always so bad at doing a self-psychoanalysis or something like that.
*  There were all these ways I was incredibly competitive and tracked as a kid. My eighth
*  grade junior high school yearbook, one of my friends said, I know you're going to get into
*  Stanford in four years. I got into Stanford and I went to Stanford. I went to law school. I ended up
*  at a top law firm in Manhattan. From the outside it was a place where everybody wanted to get in.
*  On the inside it was a place everybody wanted to get out. I had some kind of a quarter-life crisis
*  in my mid-20s. It was unclear what to do. But somehow you have to try to avoid the worst
*  memetic entanglements, the worst forms of memetic competition possible. I don't think psychology
*  really works. I don't think awareness of these things is quite the way to do it. But
*  yeah, there was some part of that that was very important for me.
*  To that point, to get people off of the memetic track, I think the Thiel Fellowship was really
*  amazing and has had tremendous success. Have you thought about trying to scale that in a way that
*  might be profitable or could make a larger impact than say 20 folks a year and maybe 20,000
*  eventually? We've thought about scaling a lot of times. It's probably quite hard to scale.
*  The paradox of something like the Thiel Fellowship or my zero to one book or any sort of self-help
*  thing is it's always bad to just give advice where these are the things you're supposed to do.
*  I worry that trying to scale things, the only way you can scale things is by somehow automating
*  them, mechanizing them, turning them into more of a cookie cutter type process. And then
*  I always worry that that deranges at scale. So somehow, I can't give people a formula of what
*  to do. It's something like, well, you should think for yourself and figure it out. But then,
*  if I try to scale that, it's like some kind of malice little red book or something you're
*  producing and it's quite the opposite. Thank you.
*  Peter, my question is about diversity, equity, and inclusion. DEI has become very prevalent
*  in corporate America. I wanted to get your thoughts on whether you're seeing this in some
*  of the early stage companies also, like the companies that found this fund as investing in.
*  What are your thoughts? Do you think this is something positive? Are you neutral?
*  Or you think this has gone a little over the top? I would love to know your views on that.
*  I'm very against it. I don't always know if it's the most important issue either.
*  So somehow, I wrote a book after my undergraduate years entitled The Diversity Myth. It was
*  focusing on a lot of the craziness, the campus wars, culture wars that were taking place at
*  Stanford in the late 80s, early 90s. There are parts of it that seemed very prescient. It
*  described a lot of things that eventually spread to the broader culture. On another level,
*  it was like a completely ineffective book where the arguments didn't matter.
*  What drove these things somehow was on a very different level.
*  If we think about the woke corporation in Silicon Valley, it seems unhealthy if a company
*  is leaning too much into the DEI narratives. There probably are Machiavellian ways where this
*  can also work, where it distracts people. Walmart was the proto woke company in the 2000s,
*  and they were constantly being attacked by the labor unions because they weren't paying their
*  workers enough. They could pay their workers more, or they could rebrand themselves as a green
*  environmentally friendly company. That turned out to be a very cheap way to split up the left-wing
*  anti-Walmart coalition. That was a version of it as this sort of capitalist conspiracy against it.
*  Then there are cases where that can work and cases where it can go wrong. For the most part,
*  I think that it's just a distraction from more important things. There's one level on which I
*  find the issues very silly. There's another level where it's evil because it's stopping us
*  from paying attention to more important things. It's things like the economy, like science and
*  tech, or even these broader religious questions that we've talked about today. People always talk
*  about it in terms of cultural Marxism, but I think a real Marxist would be much preferable
*  to a diversity person. Rosa Luxemburg, who's this crazed communist from the early 20th century,
*  it was like, I think one thing she said was, there can be nobody more revolutionary than a
*  factory worker. Nobody can be more revolutionary than a proletarian. A diversity officer in a
*  university or corporation, what would Rosa Luxemburg think of this? It would be in the
*  same category as a bank robber or a prostitute, as someone who's just an extremely corrupt form
*  of crony capitalism. Thank you so much. There's a fair amount of variation and regulation on
*  biotech. There's Prospero, you've funded some C setting places. What's your sense for why there
*  aren't crazy, cool, ambitious bio hacking things going on? Where are the gene edited babies? The
*  only one that we know about happened in China and that guy went to jail. Why isn't there more
*  crazy stuff happening in different jurisdictions? My sense is the FDA has a global stranglehold on
*  everything. There are a lot of different reasons. In practice, most governments are not willing to
*  have looser regulations than the FDA. There's less regulatory arbitrage than it looks.
*  Then secondarily, the US pays a lot more for this than other countries. We can go into all these
*  debates about whether we're paying too much in the US or whether the rest of the world should be
*  penalized for free riding off of it. If you develop a biotech drug and if you can't sell it in the US,
*  the economics are much less good. In practice, it tends to be US robust.
*  Do you think that technology will eventually render a larger proportion of the human population
*  unproductive or unable to contribute to the economy? If so, what should those unproductive
*  people do with themselves? I think the Luddites have always been wrong for a long time.
*  There are certainly ways. You could probably scare me some with AI and their versions of it
*  where you could... But even if you convinced me that the Luddites were right about AI and that
*  it's actually going to just replace people without... If you're a Luddite in the mid-19th
*  century, you said the machines are going to replace the humans. That would be such a relief
*  because there's so much work for people to do and it would just free them up to do other things.
*  So maybe it's less complimentary, more game of substitution. Even if you could convince me of
*  that, I'm still in favor of the AI because my default is muddling through isn't good.
*  My default is... The default is really bad. And so you don't get to muddle through with Greta on
*  our bicycle. Thanks for coming. You've alluded to a lot of the forces between decentralization and
*  centralization, particularly around AI with forces around the individual. I was wondering if you could
*  talk a little bit more, describe what you think the forces could be that stop AI development,
*  particularly as it relates to the state's role or how a politician or another entity could co-opt
*  that force for their own benefit versus the benefit of many. Maybe the premise of your
*  question is what I'd challenge is why is AI going to be the only technology that matters?
*  If we say there's only this one big technology that's going to be developed and it is going
*  to dominate everything else, that's already in a way conceding a version of the centralization
*  point. So yeah, if we say that it's all around the next generation of large language models,
*  nothing else matters, then you've probably collapsed it to a small number of players
*  and that's a future that I find somewhat uncomfortably centralizing probably.
*  But the definition of technology. In the 1960s, technology meant computers, but it also meant new
*  medicines and it meant spaceships and supersonic planes and the Green Revolution and agriculture.
*  And then at some point, technology today just means IT and maybe we're going to narrow it even
*  further to AI and it seems to me that this narrowing is sort of a manifestation of the
*  centralizing stagnation that we should be trying to get out of.
*  Earlier you mentioned that tech might end up saving San Francisco from itself.
*  AI specifically, yeah.
*  Sorry, AI specifically. How do you evaluate the efforts of places like Miami and Austin
*  to present themselves as alternative tech hubs and has that opinion changed over the
*  course of the last two years?
*  Well, I'm still very pro-Miami. I think the Miami story has been more of an anti-New York story,
*  so it's a tale of two cities and the finance part of the economy doesn't have to be centered in
*  New York and that alone I think explains a great deal of Miami's success. I think the tech
*  you know again, it's not we're in a very different place from what people were focused on even
*  two, two and a half years ago, but two and a half years ago there was sort of much more of a crypto
*  story and the you know crypto is a decentralizing technology but also the companies that were doing
*  crypto were decentralized, not just in the U.S. There's a decent number of them outside the U.S.
*  And so if crypto was going to be a big part of the future tech story, that would have been a
*  naturally decentralizing from Silicon Valley narrative. Silicon Valley had really missed out
*  on the crypto thing in a relative sense and then you know consumer internet, you know a lot of this
*  happened in Silicon Valley for all sorts of complicated reasons, you know supposed to get
*  rid of the tyranny of place but it all happened in one place and then the AI piece seems to be even
*  more centralized in Silicon Valley. So again if we say that you know the next decade or two decades
*  are just going to be doubling down on AI, that probably suggests that you know San Francisco will
*  and Silicon Valley will maintain or even gain power. Hello first and foremost I just want to
*  say thank you for coming out and doing this event, it's been wonderful. I have a silly question and I
*  going to bring Star Wars into it since we were talking Star Trek but when you this concept of
*  the world order, it's the first time I've really delved into it and thinking about it I'm wondering
*  do you envision a world order that's just like totalitarian dictatorship or just the similar to
*  like there's just too much information, too many countries, too many people trying to vie
*  together and that everything just kind of gets lost and that the power isn't really about the
*  people but that kind of world central, I mean a global central, like what is that that you envision?
*  Well I'd like to avoid the first type and then it's always, yeah the second one I will concede
*  it's a little bit more confusing and you know there's and so yeah you I would like to have
*  you know a libertarian world order of you know many nations and you can move between them
*  but and so there's some transnational thing, you're not completely stuck in a particular country
*  but then the transnational thing can't be so powerful that it actually controls all the nations
*  and this is these are sort of maybe this is a sort of paradox of globalizations like Hegelian thought
*  is always you know thesis, antithesis, synthesis even if you agree this is the correct framing
*  the problem is people always confuse the synthesis with the superposition of the thesis and antithesis
*  so if we say globalization some global world order is the final synthesis is globalization as
*  is described today just a superposition of a slightly unstable you know global market but no
*  global government and then can that really be maintained so yes I think there probably are
*  you know some paradoxes in my picture of a desirable world order that you know one could
*  unpack some more but yeah if we have too concrete a picture of exactly what the world order looks
*  like that's probably really bad. A bit of a follow-up to the gentleman too before me, I
*  understand you've spent a little bit of time in Miami so at kind of coming down from the macro
*  level to the street level local governance almost like an economist getting lunch perspective what
*  is Miami doing well and what does Miami need to improve upon? Well there are a lot of things I've
*  been here the last four winters so it's been two three months each winter here yeah there are a
*  lot of things that I think are going incredibly well I'm always into these sort of Georgist
*  real estate theories where if you're not very careful all the the value in a place gets captured
*  by the sort of corrupt real estate group of people and there's sort of a Henry George was
*  a late 19th century economist who was sort of like sort of socialist then today seemed
*  a sort of libertarian which probably just tells something about how our society's changed but
*  the you know the worry in Miami is that is it have we really escaped the Georgist disaster that is
*  San Francisco that is New York that is London where even though there's been a tremendous
*  increase in GDP you know it's not good if 100% of it gets captured by you know by slumlords
*  or something like that. Thanks. Last question. Thanks so question about AI and theology. Voltaire
*  had this great quote if God didn't exist we would need to invent him or her or whatever the pronoun
*  is. Do you find this view of like super intelligence AI which might be in the near future as a kind of
*  deity as a kind of machine god is that useful is there leverage that and it could even be more
*  than just heuristics and kind of substantive statement. It's sort of a purely theological
*  question I want to focus more on the political theology question which would be something like
*  you know if it's a centralizing AI that's controlled by communist China will it just
*  be very good at convincing people that the party is God or that the wisdom of crowds or
*  whatever the consensus is the truth and then yeah there are these metaphysical questions where
*  it doesn't seem like it's exactly you know I don't know a transcendent traditional monotheistic God
*  but I would go to more of the political questions than the you know the metaphysical ones and
*  probably the you know the risk danger is that there's something about the sort of telescopes
*  even more the sort of you know consensus truth wisdom of crowds you know I think probably
*  on all the models you know it will tell you that there's no particular
*  religion that's more true than any other one and then is that really what the models generate or
*  is that has that been hardwired in those are the questions I'd be more curious about.
*  Thank you all for listening to conversations with Tyler at the Mercatus Center.
*  Most of all thank you Peter. Thank you.
*  you
