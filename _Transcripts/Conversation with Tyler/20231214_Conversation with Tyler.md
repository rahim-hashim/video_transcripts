Video Description: In her third appearance on the show, Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop joins Tyler and a group of special guests to celebrate the release of Invitation to a Banquet, her new book exploring the history, philosophy, and techniques of Chinese culinary culture. As with her previous appearance, this conversation was held over a banquet meal at Mama Chang and was hosted by Lydia Chang.

As they dined, the group discussed why the diversity in Chinese cuisine is still only just being appreciated in the West, how far back our understanding of it goes, how it’s represented in the Caribbean and Ireland, whether technique trumps quality of ingredients, why certain cuisines can spread internationally with higher fidelity, what we can learn from the different styles in Indian and Chinese cooking, why several dishes on the table featured Amish ingredients, the most likely mistake people will make when making a stir fry, what Lydia has learned managing an empire of Chinese restaurants, Fuchsia’s trick for getting unstuck while writing, and more.
  
Joining Tyler, Fuchsia, and Lydia around the table were Dan Wang, Rasheed Griffith, Fergus McCullough, and Sam Enright.

Special thanks to Chef Peter Chang, Lydia, and all the staff at Mama Chang for the wonderful meal.

# Fuchsia Dunlop on the Story of Chinese Food  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrm2qCR_y4E)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today we're sitting in Mamachang Restaurant in Fairfax, Virginia, one of my favorite restaurants
*  of all time anywhere, and we are here with Fuchsia Dunlop.
*  Now Fuchsia is the only individual we have done three conversations with Tyler with,
*  and that should tell you everything.
*  Fuchsia quite simply writes the best books.
*  I don't mean the best books on Chinese food, I mean the best books.
*  And there is a new one, Invitation to a Banquet, the Story of Chinese Food, which is just out.
*  Fuchsia, welcome.
*  We're delighted to have you here.
*  Thank you Tyler, great to be back.
*  Let's just start with very quick introductions of everyone at the table going around this
*  way.
*  Hi everyone, I'm Lydia.
*  I am the business owner.
*  This is my family business and welcome everyone to Mamachang.
*  Hi, my name is Fergus.
*  I work on the Fitzwilliam and online publication of Irish Ideas.
*  I'm Sam.
*  I'm an economics undergrad and I work on the Fitzwilliam with Fergus.
*  I'm Rashid and I help Tyler at Mercatus with the Emerged Adventures.
*  I'm Dan Wong.
*  I spent the last six years in China.
*  Now I'm at the Yale Law School as a visiting scholar.
*  Very simple question to start, Fuchsia.
*  How is real soy sauce better than what we might buy in the store?
*  Well I guess naturally fermented artisanal soy sauce has a kind of tang to it and a richness,
*  which would be much more impressive than your average sort of mass manufactured soy sauce,
*  if you're lucky enough to get some.
*  How many different soy sauces do you either make or own?
*  Oh I don't make them, but I have, I don't have that many actually, a select few.
*  You know, there are other decisions to make when cooking apart from choose between 50
*  soy sauces.
*  And where in China has the best soy sauce?
*  So your favorite in your opinion?
*  Well Fujian is supposed to be best for artisanal soy sauce, but I suppose there's an amazing
*  really traditional soy sauce factory in Hejiang in southern Sichuan and it's this magical
*  place on the banks of the river with all these clay pots, tanzas, with straw hats covering
*  when it rains, laid out with sort of traditional buildings and they do traditional old fashioned
*  no modern innovation soy sauce and a combination of the flavor and the place is just exceptional.
*  Now many of your books, they're cookbooks, they're history books, they're also a kind
*  of cultural studies set of books, but your latest book, again Invitation to a Banquet,
*  it is primarily a history, right?
*  It's not a recipes book.
*  So after having gone through so much history of Chinese food, what updates have you made
*  or what have you changed your mind about?
*  What do you and FC differently?
*  Well I suppose the striking thing about Chinese culinary history is that there are these extraordinary
*  continuities going back thousands of years in some cases, like steaming for example since
*  the Neolithic age or making fermented soybean products going back more than 2000 years,
*  but that it's also always been so multicultural and so sort of innovative, like you know the
*  Han dynasty about 2000 years ago was a period when lots of new ingredients and technology
*  actually critically for milling flour from wheat which brought noodles and so on to China
*  that came in and I think while researching this book it was just a real reminder of how
*  receptive Chinese food has been to other influences and how it's a kind of composite of many
*  different places and ideas.
*  So we're here in 2023, you've been to China recently, you went all over, perhaps you had
*  a few meals, during pandemic times it was hard to get there, over those years what has
*  changed or what has struck you as different?
*  Well so going back the first thing that was really striking there were many fewer foreigners,
*  so you know when I was there in the 90s there weren't many foreigners at all and I felt
*  very conspicuous and then there's been a period with loads of expats and visitors and tourists
*  and sort of in the wake of the pandemic again I was feeling like I was the only foreigner
*  around and food wise well one thing that I found hilarious and surprising was having
*  takeouts delivered to a hotel room by robots, so that's never happened to me here, so technological
*  advances and then also everyone I met was talking about yu zi, like semi-prepared dishes
*  so it's been a real trend in China that restaurants are having central kitchens that are supplying
*  dishes that are either fully made and just need reheating or partially made to be finished
*  in a restaurant and it seems to be a really hot topic of conversation and of course all
*  these concerns about sort of the erosion of culinary skills if chefs are not learning
*  to cook from scratch but are just finishing dishes.
*  I have more questions but now we turn to Lydia to tell us what just arrived.
*  Right, so welcome to Mama Chan and today we're having a banquet meal, so invitation to a
*  banquet. We typically like to start our banquet meal with something cold, a cold platter and
*  today we have a platter of four different kinds. We have the fava beans with goji berry,
*  we have the braised shiitake mushroom, we have some tofu skin and mala beef jerky.
*  Are Chinese eating habits individualizing? So we're here together as a group, we're going to
*  share a lot of dishes, it's how it should be done but as you know birth rates are declining,
*  more people in many countries spend more time alone, that makes it harder to have that kind
*  of meal. How is that evolving in China? Well I think it's very noticeable that restaurants in
*  cities, there are more restaurants with small tables designed for couples and smaller groups
*  and yeah so but I mean you still have the kind of round table big gang but also alternatives.
*  I have more questions but let me now turn to Dan Wong to my left who will ask a question or two.
*  Fuchsia in your book you quote Darren Adria as saying who is the most important culinary figure
*  of the last 50 years? Well surely it is Mao Zedong because the chairman sent all of China's
*  farmers and all of China's chefs to work in factories thus destroying the preeminence of
*  Chinese cuisine. Is he right? How much do we really understand what culinary culture was between
*  you know before the People's Republic and can we recover a lot of those traditions now? I mean one
*  of the reasons that I wrote this book is that it seems to me extraordinary that China has this
*  exceptional cuisine which is so diverse and sophisticated and also which resonates with so
*  many contemporary concerns and you know there are parallels in China of going back to the 10th
*  century of people making imitation meats from plant foods. You have this tremendously creative
*  transformational cuisine which echoes the avant-garde cooking of modernist chefs in the west.
*  All this stuff and yet China has been a sort of terror incognito for many people in the food world
*  and this is I think it's purely historical reasons. So you know the Chinese food that
*  most people in the west know stems from American Chinese food which was created by immigrants from
*  one particular region the Cantonese south who were working in very difficult circumstances.
*  You know they were facing racial prejudice, they probably didn't have access to all the ingredients
*  that they were used to and they were often cooking for people who had no acquaintance with
*  Chinese food. So you have this simplified very appealing fantastically popular and successful
*  but not really a good representation of this amazing culinary nation. So yeah I think and then
*  throughout the 20th century war revolution, cultural revolution and so China was just you
*  know not part of international culinary exchanges and I think also prestige food is often about money.
*  You know Japan got rich first, Japanese food is very prestigious, people will spend loads of money
*  on Japanese sushi but not so much on Chinese food. So I think that yeah Ferran Adria is right that
*  Chinese food doesn't have the recognition, the acknowledgement that it really should have and
*  yeah and I think now it's possible really you know to have a fresh look.
*  Can we cook a 10th century meal from Hangzhou today or is that mostly lost to us?
*  Well the frustrating thing is that there are some there's an amazing source well actually of sort of
*  what is it 12th 13th century Hangzhou describing all the food served in city restaurants and it is dizzying.
*  You know there are all different kinds of restaurants, regional Buddhist vegetarian
*  restaurants, restaurants for students and snack shops of different kinds and the author lists
*  all these delicacies but there are no recipes or descriptions. So there's tantalizingly not very
*  complete information but you could you know I know chefs I know a chef in Hangzhou actually who has
*  created banquets of Song dynasty food as far as possible from the texts. So I think we have to
*  partly use imagination and but some you know there are some you know continuities in ingredients and
*  techniques so. Fuchsia will give you a moment to eat so I'll ask you Dan a question. Much of pandemic
*  you spent in China some of that in Yunnan. What did you learn about Yunnanese food during those months?
*  I wonder whether Yunnanese food can be considered a cuisine as such. I think it is mostly not a very
*  convenient label. So Yunnan is a very mountainous region that is historic Tibet in the north and
*  that is close to being culturally Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar in the south where it borders.
*  And so you know how do we make sense of a cuisine that is basically Tibet in the north and Thailand
*  in the south. I don't really think that there's such a thing as possible that it is such a
*  mountainous zone you know splintered by you know perplexed with intricacies and so you know I think
*  this is mostly mountain food depends on where you go. I don't think we can recognize it as a coherent
*  cuisine as such. Question for Rashid we'll get back to Fuchsia in a moment but you're from Barbados.
*  Chinese food is different in every country every region. How is Chinese food different in the
*  Caribbean? Chinese food in Barbados is actually quite dull unfortunately. However in Panama which
*  I also live Chinese food is probably as exuberant as you would go with some parts of China. There
*  are parts of Panama where if you're in the El Dorado area where dim sum is the Chinese restaurants are
*  packed. They are full not only with local Chinese but also other Panamanian races and it's just like
*  a very big aspect culture and to me also Chinese food in Panama has a much more authentic flavor
*  than even most parts of Europe if it had Chinese food. That's a I think quite surprising almost
*  like a hidden secret in Central America. And you have a question for Fuchsia. Yes so recently given
*  the often the surprising boom of Sichuan food globally even there's been a movement by some
*  elements of the government for example to publish these Sichuan requirements. I'm curious how that
*  has impacted some of the culinary styles in Sichuan. Well yeah so as you said there's been a sort of
*  bid to standardize and categorize classic dishes. So you know the local government also in Chongqing
*  they've produced publications which say this is mapo tofu and this is the ingredients like having
*  a sort of you know appellation appellation control if wine or something. But I think the point is
*  that I mean it's an interesting and noble endeavor but people cook in a much more free ad hoc creative
*  way. So there are many different ways to actually make mapo tofu maybe some key characteristics but
*  you don't have every chef measuring to the gram the amount of minced beef or the amount of Sichuan
*  pepper. So I think I would say they're not having that much influence and also because Sichuanese
*  cuisine one of the great things about it is that it's so dynamic. I mean people in Sichuan love
*  eating and they're creative and they're always you know doing things like making Sichuanese dishes
*  with okra which was not around when I was a student there in the 90s. So I think that there's
*  always this tension between you know we all feel nostalgic and we love tradition and there's
*  something worthwhile about trying to document classics and traditions but at the same time you
*  have to recognize that a cuisine is a very vital living form of culture which is recreated in every
*  kitchen every day. So yeah so the difference between practice and theory is quite you know
*  quite deep. Do you have observations on what we're eating so far? Well it's certainly delicious
*  and it's lovely to have some vegetable dishes and that's one of the things that Chinese food in the
*  West with the sort of concentration on shrimp and chicken and you know beef and fried foods and so
*  on but actually the glory of Chinese cooking is that there are so many vegetables it's healthy
*  and balanced and refreshing so you might have a rich intense dish like this mala beef numbing and
*  hot beef very delicious and rich and meaty but also we've got this lovely tofu skin with a sort
*  of very light dressing and a bit of crab meat and some very refreshing shiitake mushrooms and this
*  is gorgeous these white beans with Lao Zhao fermented glutinous rice wine and these are all quite unusual
*  to have in an American Chinese restaurant I would say. For a typical quality Chinese meal let's say
*  in the United States or maybe London what percent of the credit should go to the chefs and what
*  percent of the credit should go to the people who bought the ingredients how do you think about that?
*  You're quoting Yuan Mei the great 18th century Chinese gourmet. Well that's another thing that's
*  really interesting because I think Chinese food in the West is not associated with premium
*  ingredients so if you go to a sort of fancy Spanish restaurant they'll be trumpeting their
*  American ham so on and so on if you go to a new Californian restaurant they'll be talking about
*  which farm they got the produce from but Chinese restaurants generally don't say much about the
*  ingredients and that's just because they've been kind of stuck in this bracket where people don't
*  go to Chinese restaurants for fine ingredients which is completely mad and you know in this book
*  there's a whole chapter about this really that the Chinese practically invented the concept of
*  terroir you know the obsession with seasons with provenance you know exactly you know which land
*  your vegetables are produced on and so on in traditional Chinese cookery certainly a
*  vitally important part of it is sourcing seasonal fresh quality ingredients so it would be nice to
*  recognize that and this is clearly happening here we've got all these you know Amish farm ingredients
*  right? Yes I would say it comes maybe in both ways we appreciate and we use a lot of local ingredients
*  from the Maryland crab that paired with our tofu skin we also go out of our way trying to look for
*  seasonal like really good quality white beans what we are about to have we have some Amish pork
*  dumplings we try to source the best ingredients the whatever we can find and use it to make
*  quality dishes and I think my feeling is that you know if Chinese cuisine in the future in
*  contemporary times manages to unite the exceptional culinary skills of Chinese chefs with the old
*  obsession with ingredients they're just going to blow everyone else away. Fu-shuo, sorry. Fu-shuo
*  you mentioned the terroir concept but for example there's a very big it's a very high-end tea for
*  example and it foams a lot of the terroir aspect I'm wondering how much of that is a quality
*  difference or is it really a big chunk of marketing itself? Well it's I mean it's like wine isn't it
*  it's exactly the same so I think that you know to an extent probably there is you know that the exact
*  the soil and the weather in a particular place will influence an ingredient but clearly there's
*  also a sort of cultural and imaginative aspect and so there's a lot of fakery as well so people
*  pretending that they're supplying Longjing tea from from the Longjing hills around Hangzhou when
*  it's not actually that but probably people who drink it still feel that it's finer because of
*  the label. Sam do you have a question for Fu-shuo? Yeah so I went to India for the first time over
*  the summer and the food was wonderful but it sort of struck me that it was Indian food had
*  transferred with relatively high fidelity to like very high-end Indian restaurants in Glasgow or
*  Birmingham and so on. Nothing in the cuisine was sort of shocking to me in a way that I suspect
*  it would be traveling around different areas of China so I mean you mentioned Chinese food in the
*  West being so Cantonese but is there kind of more to it than that or like more factors that determine
*  which cuisines translate with higher fidelity? Yeah so the first thing is that China is absolutely
*  vast and it has a very stunning diversity of different terrains and climates with all the
*  implications for produce so there are so many ingredients from different places so you're only
*  ever going to see small snapshots of this great richness of Chinese cuisine abroad so even though
*  now we're beginning to see you know Sichuanese food and different regional cuisines there is so
*  much more. I mean I've been researching this for about 30 years and I'm still discovering
*  entire new styles you know local traditions practically every time I go to China. So yeah
*  it's and in terms of fidelity I think Chinese food I said in the book it's a kind of victim of its
*  own success and it's all about timing so Chinese is one of the earliest immigrants cuisines at a
*  time when Western palates were probably more conservative and it was you know more difficult
*  to try and faithfully reproduce Chinese food abroad and it got stuck public perceptions of Chinese
*  food have got stuck there but now things are changing and there are so many immigrants,
*  students, visitors from other parts of China living in you know cities like this and all over the place
*  who want to eat proper Chinese food they want to eat the foods they eat at home whether it's from
*  their hometowns or it's trendy cuisines like Sichuanese so it's now possible for Chinese
*  restaurants in the West to you know they don't have to tailor to Western tastes they can just
*  start off doing food for Chinese clientele so then it's more faithful. One should also say that
*  some of the I mean like your Yunnan cuisine for example that the marvelous thing about Yunnan
*  cuisine is all these local produce there are so many ingredients that you simply can't find
*  anywhere else in China let alone abroad and so it's harder to I mean you can't really reproduce
*  many aspects of Yunnan cuisine wouldn't you say? Yeah that's right if I can ask a follow-up question
*  on this comparison between India and China you know maybe this is half a question also for Tyler.
*  Why do we associate Indian cuisine so much more with long simmers where yes Chinese cuisine of
*  course it is a little bit of everything as Fu Xia knows so well but it is often a little bit more
*  associated with quick fries you know what is the factual endowment here of you know these two very
*  big countries very big civilizations having somewhat divergent paths as we imagine with
*  culinary traditions? That's a really interesting question and it's it's hard to answer because I
*  don't really know anything about Indian food. I did have a really interesting conversation with
*  an Indian who came on my tour to Yunnan earlier this year because I was kind of speculating that
*  one of the reasons that Chinese food is so diverse is that the Chinese are really open-minded with
*  very few taboos so apart from you know Muslims eating halal food and some Buddhists not eating
*  meat there's a kind of great adventurous open-mindedness to eating whereas in India
*  you have lots of taboos and sort of religious and ritual restrictions and interesting you know and
*  that's one reason that you would think it would be a constraint on the creativity of Indian food
*  but this Indian I was talking to who's a food specialist he reckoned that the restrictions
*  actually forced people to be more creative so he was arguing that Indian food was you know had all
*  the conditions for diversity that Chinese does but in terms of cooking methods it's hard to say and
*  again I don't know about Indian food but the thing about China is that there's been this
*  intense thoughtfulness about food really for a very long time I mean you know you see it in
*  descriptions of food from 2000 years ago and more and then in the Song dynasty this incredible
*  restaurant industry in places like Hangzhou and innovation and creativity and so I suppose that
*  when you are thoroughly interested in food like the Chinese and thinking about it creatively all
*  the time you end up having a whole plethora of different cooking methods and that's one of the
*  striking things about Chinese cuisine right that you have slow cooked stews and simmered things
*  and steamed things and also stir-frying so that might explain why you know several different
*  methods have achieved prominence. Before I comment on that Lydia on the new dish please tell us.
*  Oh we apparently it's an empty plate now we have a vegetarian spring roll so spring roll is
*  something that we love to have as a holiday special we have the over spring the lunar new year
*  or you know it's actually you wrap things together sometimes you add shrimp pork and for this one we
*  use vegetarian and that's a really amazing vegetarian dish. On your India China question
*  this is pure speculation but my sense has been China was wealthier earlier for a longer period
*  of time and on average stayed wealthier so it had more in the way of meats and you had people eating
*  in large groups so the idea that you would chop up the meat and divide the meat and feed it to
*  people and then flash stir-fry the meat in some way India it's more likely you're cooking
*  vegetables you're on various spice trails to a greater degree those Indian spices work very
*  well being simmered for a long period of time you're less concerned with how am I going to
*  cook this meat because Hindus are not eating beef and it seems that pigs are much harder to raise
*  in India than in China that would be my guess but do you have a take? I have no take. Okay but I
*  another idea that I was thinking of was that also and again I don't know about India but China very
*  early on like in the Song dynasty from about 12th century had a really lively and developed and
*  diverse restaurant scene with restaurants at different levels and so eating out was a real
*  thing and I should imagine it with eating out that and there were restaurants with menus where you
*  would order your dishes you know not just fixed menus and so on and so in those conditions you
*  do want dishes that can be made quickly to order so maybe that would encourage the development of
*  fast cooking methods as well as you know home cooking and you know slow the pot on the stove
*  in the home kitchen. What about yitang di ssenshian? So the hot food would beat three times over the
*  flavors or Chinese people love to eat quick hot food. Yeah well I suppose and also urbanization
*  but actually another thing and is the the emphasis on texture and I don't really know
*  about the history of this but one of the really distinctive things about Chinese gastronomy is
*  that the Chinese totally appreciate and understand texture to a degree that is unheard of anyone else
*  really and that's why they enjoy eating so many slithery rubbery and also often tasteless foods
*  that have interesting textures and there are certain textures so for example one of my
*  sort of old favorites a Chinese dish fire exploded kidney flowers so that's made with
*  pork kidneys which are cut into little frilly pieces and stir-fried very fast and you actually
*  have to cook them fast to keep them nun and a little bit sort of crisp right so I think
*  perhaps when people have this obsession with texture there are certain ingredients
*  that require fast cooking also vegetables right so you don't have everything very soft but you
*  have this briskness liveliness crispness in the bite but what's your speculation why this colgan
*  is such a big feature of the Chinese food okay speculation again but I mean but I think the
*  thing about um there was this ancient philosopher who said food and sex are human nature
*  and there's this unabashed pleasure in the physicality of eating like English people
*  traditionally are a bit sort of buttoned up and you know it's impolite to make noises when you
*  eat and it's not very proper to show too much exuberant delight in food right but in China
*  you see this absolute joy in eating in ancient poetry in the way people eat today and and I
*  think part of that is is feeling uninhibited about it as something physical so like when you
*  eat in China you can make little noises you can you can put something like a duck's tongue that's
*  grapples and a bit bony and complicated to your lips and you can enjoy the game with your teeth
*  and tongue and that's all perfectly acceptable and enjoyed perhaps when you don't mind a little
*  noise and you're not shy of the physicality then you can have things that are slithery and crunchy
*  and you know require a bit of engagement when you eat them really makes you wonder about the
*  English approach to sex yes well let's pulse swiftly on this Lydia please tell us about the
*  new dish oh we're having a jing some soup with what looks like tofu but it's actually chicken
*  and this is a classic Sichuan banquet dish which goes back at least 100 years it's sort of written
*  about in a very famous text early 20th century and it's just a reminder that Sichuan food is
*  not all spicy you know like any other Chinese cuisine it's about balance so if you have very
*  you know intensely flavored and hot dishes and oily dishes you always have refreshing
*  like things like this lovely broth and this is Amish chicken right why is that how and why is
*  that different and better well let's just say that the environment has a lot to do with how
*  things are raised and you know it's when dad first met the Amish community he felt a strong
*  tie to the way we leave it reminded him a lot of the time you know he was raised as a boy
*  in the village in China in the 60s my grandmother was a farmer she used to be the one that's earning
*  all the credits and contribute that to the local the village government and in return they don't
*  really have a lot to eat on the table so it's the humble life of the Amish community reminded that
*  a lot of nostalgia Sam do you have another question well I was going to say Tyler recently
*  told me that the third best chicken he ever had was an Amish chicken which pleased me a lot because
*  it implies you have an encyclopedic ranking of every chicken you've eaten yeah I mean to continue
*  on the train of extremely speculative things there's this famous or perhaps infamous observation
*  about how whether areas of China engaged in mostly wheat based or mostly rice based agriculture
*  has effects centuries later on you know various social outcomes SAT scores etc
*  and you know thinking about our land where I'm from even just beyond the famine like it seems
*  like there are many ways in which the presence of the potato like and the dominance of it like
*  affects culture and land holdings and so on how do you like think about the role of the staple crop
*  in creating like the culture or cuisine of a certain place well an easy question
*  and you thought I asked hard once well I suppose I mean that China was a whole civilization that
*  grew around the staple grain which was originally millet and all the rituals of the state the ancient
*  Chinese state were about offering food to gods and ancestors so wheat and alcohol and so there is a
*  millet and alcohol and so on and roasted meats and yeah I mean I suppose what's interesting about
*  that is that millet went on being the sacred grain right up until the end of you know the
*  the Chinese imperial period in about 1911 but it had actually disappeared from people's daily diets
*  so people in north China went on to eat wheat and noodles and breads but millet remained the
*  staple grain but um yeah so I guess there's a gulf between what people are actually eating
*  and ideas about ritual and so on what remains of manchu cooking in Chinese food today
*  well um I mean there's a bit in the book about this idea that I mean one of the distinctive
*  thing about Chinese cooking going back about 2000 years is the habit of cutting food into
*  small pieces and eating it with chopsticks and yet there are some dishes which are presented whole
*  like a you know Cantonese ceremonial suckling pig or peeking duck and of course they're cut up
*  before they're served because you don't have knives at the Chinese dinner table but um the
*  Manchus were sort of rugged northern nomads who liked eating huge chunks of sheep meat
*  which they would then cut apart with their own personal knives and this was something that was
*  still part of high level society in the Qing dynasty when China was ruled by Manchus and you
*  can see these little eating sets that people slung onto their belts or tucked into their boots where
*  you have a pair of chopsticks and a knife so that people could eat both Chinese and Manchu food
*  the sort of whole roast meats particularly northern cuisine may have been a legacy of
*  this Manchu predilection for meat and there's a scholar Isaac Yue who I cited in the book who
*  looked at an 18th century Chinese banquet menu and there were whole servings of what were clearly
*  Chinese dishes with food cut up very fine and served in soups and stews and then these whole
*  services of real sort of you know charred and roasted and boiled meats which were Manchu so
*  and then also actually in Beijing cuisine there is some legacy of the Manchus in dairy foods
*  so like sort of other nomads they ate dairy foods and so you have very fascinating something in
*  Beijing imperial cuisine called Nailao junket which is like a steamed custardy dessert made from milk
*  and also another very interesting dish when nine are gone when it's cooked at a very low heat that
*  it turns to kind of fudge a bit like dolce de leche but solid so there are traces of Manchu food in
*  Chinese cooking particularly in the north Lydia what is new on the table please it's our homemade
*  pork dumpling and we use our mesh pork now maybe you can tell me what the difference is
*  If you should why doesn't work in particular have a higher status in China
*  why don't you eat so much of it it's maybe the best pork in the world right the best pork dishes
*  but it's not a higher status food or close to it well because it's popular and ubiquitous and so
*  pork is the celebratory food for anyone traditionally but in China if you want to
*  get to the really highest echelons of gastronomy you need rare and exotic and particular and
*  sought-after foods so things like deer tendons you know these are imperial delicacies camel's
*  hump you know um hashma the ovarian fat of the snow frog all these unusual delicacies
*  and bird's nest were fabulously expensive so these things are more prestigious in China in China
*  because they're scarce and expensive and extreme luxuries does bears paw actually taste good
*  you better ask someone else because you've never had it yeah you don't have bears paw
*  really serve these days it was it was it appears in in cookbooks right until the 1980s
*  you know even of state banquets but um you know it's now something but you have lots of bears in
*  America don't you we do but i don't think you're allowed to eat bears paw i'm not sure come on you
*  i've never tried it it seems awkward to eat at the very least right well but i mean if you're
*  chinese that's no problem because you know um people in china eat camel's feet and pig's feet
*  and they cook them to make the most of these grisly and gelatinous textures so the fact that
*  it's um highly grapples and not appealing to a western palate is no problem at all
*  vergis you have questions yeah so as we sort of alluded to earlier there's this
*  regional divide in china where in the north um you know wheat is sort of primarily grown rather than
*  rice um which is obviously much the same as as europe so what is the kind of explanatory factor
*  that means that in china people tend to make noodles rather than bread and obviously bread
*  in europe rather than noodles is there a kind of factor a single factor that explains that
*  so it seems that um the this is um there's a very interesting book a cultural history of chopsticks
*  by edward q wong who looks a bit at this but it seems that the chinese very early on apart from
*  eating um food that was cut into small pieces they really liked eating food that was plucked out of
*  hot liquid right and so the classic ancient chinese dish long before stir fries and the more
*  more sort of famous modern chinese dishes was the gung which was a sort of soupy stew made from lots
*  of ingredients that were cut into small pieces floating around together in liquid and of course
*  this sort of evolved with the use of chopsticks which are very suited for eating that kind of
*  dish and um so it seems like some you know early forms of pasta appear to have been you know bits
*  of dough dropped into hot liquid and that would have fitted in to the china you know a way of
*  eating that was already becoming you know a bit distinctively chinese you could say and so um and
*  i think that's still the case that wouldn't you say lydia that chinese people really like liquids
*  in their food more than westerners so a classic chinese you know in england we say meat and two
*  veg is like a basic standard meal in chinese it's four dishes and a soup and when i was living in
*  sechuan you know you never have a meal without soup it might be really really basic but it's
*  just going to be a light broth to cleanse the palate and sort of you know refresh you after
*  the other dishes so i think perhaps you know and in modern china you know westerners much prefer
*  chow mein stir-fried noodles chinese is all soupy noodles and fried noodles are much much less
*  common really so perhaps this is what why and also just in china until very recently and still in
*  most cases chinese people don't have ovens at home they do not roast or bake so everything was done
*  on a stove top a design that really hadn't changed much for 2000 years you know so you have um you
*  can still see in farm houses in china these stoves with two openings for woks or steamers
*  and that's how you cook and so bread in china traditionally is usually steamed and sometimes
*  cooked on a kind of griddle maybe with a lid like xiaobing but um yeah the absence of ovens as a
*  common kitchen implement and the love of hot liquid now you live in london if i'm looking for
*  good chinese food in london conceptually how should i go about it should i run to chinatown
*  should i go to the outer boroughs or what's the right schema apart from any particular place you
*  might recommend well i mean i would look at where chinese students are eating partly so then you'll
*  get the sort of more recent trends in china but how do i find that out if i just ask chat gpt it
*  will it tell me where the chinese students are eating or no you need someone someone who reads
*  to go on social media and find whatever what is being talked about i think that would help
*  maybe the app is going to help students uh how much cumin is too much for a donbass barbecue
*  oh i mean that's a matter of taste right i have no idea yes have you been have you been assaulted
*  by excessive amounts of cumin now not all to me it varies so much because sometimes i
*  cumins like it just cumin flamed essentially yeah and then sometimes it's not at all and i ask people
*  you know how do you determine they say well guess taste but it feels like i felt with something more
*  than just i decide today to put more cumin than not than not right very unstandard in that sense
*  hmm yes i have no idea i'm afraid okay follow up question um so a very standard caribbean dish
*  is jerk chicken yeah and a very strong component of that is soy sauce and people don't always
*  consider it as a chinese influence but of course it is and i'm curious if you if there are any
*  other areas of standard dishes across the world where it has a very strong chinese influence people
*  don't really realize it itself well that's hard to say i mean i suppose that i mean all soy products
*  is you know the influence of china right because china domesticated the soybean very early on and
*  soy soy foods have been incredibly important also in you know they came to japan from china right
*  making tofu and soy sauce so um wouldn't mexican mole be an example those original prebler recipes
*  from the 17th century what came on the galleon from philippines a lot of chinese influence
*  ingredients yeah i have been told okay speculatively
*  yeah i'm trying to think of examples i'm really not sure if a reader is using their recipe your
*  recipes and they make a mistake what's the most likely mistake for them to make i mean
*  um not not paying attention to cutting things evenly with stir-fried food maybe and how does
*  that influence the final taste or what goes wrong then well it's just if you're stir-frying something
*  that's cut into um slivers or slices the whole point of stir-frying is meant to be very fast
*  and the reason that it's effective is that if the food is cut finely and evenly then everything will
*  be perfectly done at the same moment and if the cutting is clunky and uneven then some pieces
*  will be overcooked while others are still raw so i think that's maybe something that people
*  don't necessarily realize that it's not just aesthetically important it's also technically
*  important in chinese food why might an older chinese chef be reluctant to stir-fry himself
*  or herself oh well that's um yeah because um and this is something that several people told me that
*  stir-frying is perhaps the most difficult of all cooking methods in any cuisine because it's so fast
*  and there's no room for maneuver there's no margin for error so if you have food that's
*  finely cut and that is sensitive to heat so like i don't know stir-fried scallops for example um so
*  if you overcook them it's a complete disaster so you have to cook very quickly and you have to add
*  your seasonings absolutely correctly because you can't start by making a hollandaise sauce when
*  you can have a taste and then add a bit more lemon juice or whatever you have to just have this
*  instinct so it's like wushu it's like martial arts you have to be on the top of your game and
*  it's incredible seeing you know when you see a really accomplished chef with a professional
*  cooker stir-frying it is so fast and it's so instinctive there's no measured thought they're
*  just doing it correctly and it's a kind of miracle when it turns out right and yes i found that
*  sometimes when chefs have been explaining even their own personal classic dishes to me their
*  preferred method is to stand by the walk and get a younger apprentice to cook and people have said
*  that's because you know the elder chefs have more a management role they're not cooking every day
*  so like a martial artist or a dancer they're not they don't have that fluidity and sharp instinct
*  that you have when you're doing it constantly so you may eat your dumpling i have a question for
*  dan dan you're a canadian citizen you've also spent plenty of time in china how is chinese food
*  different in the united states versus canada i think canada depends on where you go but where
*  i grew up in ottawa there wasn't a terribly great amount of chinese cuisine and i think the there
*  was a little bit more of the cantonese influence you know something like 11 percent of canadians
*  live abroad and that was that's i believe that is the highest ratio in the world and that is because
*  in about you know in the 90s the canadian government just offered extraordinary numbers of visas to
*  hong kongers to basically escape hong kong before the before their return to the mainland and so
*  that has a very big cantonese influence now i haven't really tested this but people would say
*  that vancouver at some points had you know the best chinese food in the world because of just
*  the amount of influx there but i haven't really tasted enough in vancouver to say i've only been
*  there three times my sense was they had first-rate cantonese food not quite as good as hong kong but
*  you know clearly the best in this hemisphere but in the other areas at least at the time they were
*  much weaker right fergus and or sam do you have comments on chinese food in ireland northern
*  ireland scotland or anywhere else you've been yeah i mean i suppose chinese food in ireland is
*  similarly not very developed like in berberos if there is any sort of non-generic chinese restaurant
*  in ireland is probably such one so i'm interested like how did such one become maybe this is not an
*  accurate description like prestige cuisine like the one if a first regional chinese restaurant
*  opens in a city it's most likely to be that one how did that happen well i think that such when
*  these food travels really well so there are some cuisines like the food of the jiangnan region or
*  yunnan we already said there are so many really unique local ingredients that you can't get
*  elsewhere and when you think about yunnan food you think about these extraordinary ingredients
*  but such one food the heart and soul of such one is cooking is in the the artful combination of
*  flavors so not just mala numbing and hot but also yuxiang which is you know a bit of sweet and sour
*  pickle chili ginger garlic spring onion all these wonderful combinations of flavors and i think that
*  if you have because this sort of identity of such when these food is in the the flavors you can apply
*  a such when these you sound fish fragrant sauce to the kind of fish that you can get in that you can
*  get say in england it doesn't have to be a local carp it'll still feel like such when he's cooking
*  because the flavorings and the techniques are there so i think that with you know such when he's
*  cooked just needs a sort of small battery of key ingredients such one pepper dried chilies
*  pickled chilies doubanjiang pickled chili paste soy sauce vinegar and then you can cook whatever's
*  to hand so i think for that reason it's quite accessible and transportable as a sort of concept
*  and a practice lydia could you speak to the new dish please absolutely so we have a seafood stew
*  with crispy rice and this is one of the typical dish that you think oh it's you have a rice crispy
*  on the top and cook everything so fast but i would probably call this one of the
*  because we homemade the fish ball and that process on its own is probably eight to ten hours
*  and you know you see some jumbo shrimp in there scallops and they're all cooked at different time
*  for it to be a perfect condition and what region is that from well this is something my dad is
*  holds very dearly to his heart the fish ball we eat it back at home in hubei yeah this is a i
*  would call this a hubei type how do you think about not just any single dish but how you put
*  this meal together the combination of dishes what would you tell us well i have to say if you go to
*  any chinese restaurant it would probably takes a mastermind to put a banquet menu like this
*  so either someone that's really knowledgeable in the ingredients in the methods that are things
*  are prepared you get a good balance of something mild something with soup something crispy different
*  poetry it's really like putting puzzles together and chinese people it's pretty picky so any end
*  of the meal i'm sure the guests will have something to say oh i didn't like this and that pair together
*  so it really takes a lot of skill to put a banquet menu on the table so today's meal chef peter my
*  dad actually put everything great fergus comment or question yeah going back to the sort of exotic
*  ingredients aspect so i think we even mentioned say deer tendons earlier in in the west at least
*  it's um deer are typically wild it's quite difficult to domesticate and farm them
*  so what is the kind of economy of accessing those ingredients in china look like presumably some are
*  intensively farmed if possible but presumably others are very difficult to get your hands on well
*  they're quite unusual and some of them are imported as well and some of them are wild and then of
*  course you know one of the problems that china has is also with an illegal trade in wildlife but
*  that's under the table and um you know that's um not in the open so you're unlikely to find these
*  things on sale in markets um but um yeah most people would never eat any wild food because
*  it's expensive and scarce um and yeah so i'm you know when i was saying about things like um the
*  deer tendons i mean that's a grand old imperial delicacy and not something common at all
*  and then some ingredients are imported so like um well bird's nest is farmed a lot of it's farmed
*  in malaysia right so when i go to china sometimes i'm disappointed when i see so many hot pot
*  restaurants they're typically pretty good but they're a bit all the same and maybe i'll go
*  eat there once during a trip but after that it's just a kind of plague what's your view on this
*  why is this happening i totally agree with you and i call it the hot pot ization of the chinese
*  restaurant scene and it's just you know hot pot is great fun it's a really convivial lively
*  inexpensive it can be very inexpensive way to eat and you know to to share food with your friends
*  but in terms of cooking technique it's definitely low skilled so and that of course makes it hugely
*  appealing for restaurateurs i mean you know how difficult it is to get good chefs right walk chefs
*  especially it's a nightmare um because it's so difficult to do um with hot pot you just need a
*  good soup base you can even buy it in and then you just need staff to slice up bits of food and your
*  customers cook it themselves and so i think it's partly that hot pot is very popular and partly
*  for economic reasons that it's actually just a lot easier from the point of view of the restaurateur
*  right but yeah it's support particularly with sechuan i mean sechuan has such amazingly diverse
*  and exciting food and hot pot is a poor reflection of all that and may i add i think hot pot restaurants
*  are like the mcdonald's in china it's really considered as a um fast food restaurant yeah
*  well they a lot of them are but they you also have incredibly high end ones with you know seafood and
*  weight yeah so it's sort of you find them at all levels of the market but it is a bit of a plague
*  nice in moderation by the way i have to say this the technique of this dish is fantastic and
*  you can notice well so you've got an assembly of all different ingredients and as you said they're
*  cooked separately so these fish balls have a lovely light delicate texture but they're not flat they're
*  not completely flaccid that have a bit of liveliness to them a bit of scallop in mine sort of juiciness
*  the prawn is beautifully silky and also a bit crisp and you have the vegetables that are crisp
*  and not overcooked so that shows you that they've all been cooked separately to the peak
*  then combined together and then you have the lovely contrast between the crisp crunch of the
*  the guoba the rice crust and the liquid and so there's a lot that has gone into that technically
*  right lydia the new dish please explain excuse me tell us what's the difference between chicken
*  of this sort on the bone and not on the bone this is not chicken we're having scallops today
*  okay yeah we elevated it yes you are right typically we will serve this as last
*  g red chili pepper chicken and some people would like to call it the treasure chicken because you
*  have to find the chicken among a pile of red peppers and to elevate it today we're eating
*  wild scallops that has a good heat to it it's rather lovely do you see the garnish these very
*  deftly intricately cut cucumbers and that's something that you hardly see these days so
*  it's a real sort of classic old school chinese cooking but it's labor intensive um most people
*  did you bother doing it himself or one of his he did it himself and let me say about 40 years ago
*  he was actually in a national competition to just um to compete on the knife cutting skill really
*  because apart from the technical aspects of cutting like you have to cut i mean the practical
*  aspects you have to cut to eat with chopsticks the technical ones evenness for stir-frying there's
*  also the aesthetic aspects and there's this whole other thing like the french sugar arts of completely
*  frivolous artistry with vegetable cutting dan do you have a view on hot pot um i i think it's terrible
*  what else is there to say i think that hot pot is a great social activity but it is never really
*  my first choice to eat but on the point about chains one of the things i've observed over the
*  last few years is that there has been a pretty growing scale of chain restaurants featuring
*  basically slow casual cuisine i'm thinking about sibei noodles i'm thinking about the
*  sauerkraut fish restaurant that is achieving remarkable consistency across all of these
*  different restaurants which is a pretty difficult thing to do i understand and i wonder you know do
*  you see that these restaurants can be something like ding tai feng to become you know major exports
*  at some point or do you think that will be they can't quite figure out the international market
*  um well i don't see why not i think they'd be very popular if they could export and i think that this
*  technical innovation in chinese food is something that's going to be more and more of like we
*  mentioned you know the pre-prepared dishes which is something that is not necessarily a good thing
*  but also i met a very high level chef in beijing who was showing me a robo walk you know an electric
*  wok that was trying to automate the process of stir-frying which i'm sure is at the early stages
*  but yeah i think if they can achieve the consistency and standard standardization
*  which they are doing in china then yes um but one thing about sibei particularly this is a noodle
*  a restaurant that specializes in northwestern um sort of country cooking right and particular
*  oat pasta which is a specialty of shanxi province and when shibei opened the first branches in beijing
*  they had all these people on tables outside doing incredible it's a bit hard to describe
*  that they they have a big lump of oat pasta in their hand with a little bit going between
*  their fingers and they rub it onto the board and they get a tongue of pasta on the board they whip
*  it up into a tube and they stick it in a steamer and you end up with all these tubes of pasta
*  together in a steamer like a honeycomb and then you steam them but i have to say that when i've
*  been recently they don't have those people anymore so i don't know whether they're dropping the real
*  artisanal high skilled aspects so that they can standardize and expand it but that's a bit of a
*  shame because it was lovely when it started that they were showcasing one of the amazing sort of
*  hand crafting noodle arts of shanxi either fuchsia or dan do you have an opinion on how good the
*  michelin guide is for china and i guess shanghai in particular might be where you would use it
*  do you want to go first i guess i would have never tried to look at the michelin guide that's
*  indigenous right yeah in china you know i i guess i would look a little bit more just at the apps
*  and look at the photos is michelin guide useful for you well i think they do identify some of
*  the very best restaurants in shanghai in shangdu and it's helpful for people who don't know chinese
*  to have some kind of guide but the downside is that i think although i mean the classic michelin
*  methodology is to send a single inspector to a restaurant to have a meal and that means that
*  eating like this which is more typical of many very excellent chinese restaurants is a little
*  impractical i did interview someone from michelin recently and they said that on occasion they do
*  allow inspectors to go out in groups which but certainly with the early michelin guide to shanghai
*  for example they did pick lots of excellent restaurants but they missed some that were
*  equally good but that did not have tasting menus suitable for individual diners and i'm guessing
*  that may be partly why places where you have to book a private room and have a big dinner
*  so i would say it's um that's one issue with it but they have got better also at recognizing
*  even small noodle shops in shangdu and i think they're trying to be closer to the pulse of what
*  people actually want to eat but the downside is that i know a lot of chinese chefs i know are a
*  little bit preoccupied with michelin and i think that when and it's the problem in the west too
*  but when people start aiming at michelin stars then it has certain implications for chinese
*  cuisine like a sort of pushing people towards individual plating rather than this style which
*  there's nothing wrong with but this is lovely eating like this too so i sort of hope that it
*  doesn't sort of distort the way that chinese chefs are actually cooking and presenting their food
*  how are social media changing chinese food in the u.s people instagram their food i would say far
*  too often so there's an incentive to create instagramable dishes what's going on in china
*  totally in china i mean everyone's on their phones like maniacs like people everywhere else
*  and um yes and certainly um very visually exciting food and that's one problem actually with
*  sechuanese food but i think it's the real drama dishes like you know this sort of larder chicken
*  normally which are great but they're just one facet of a very diverse cuisine and um again i
*  think maybe they encourage restaurants not just in china but everywhere but it's the same pressures
*  of social media and um yeah podcast but when they're in the restaurant i guess it's a whole
*  menu dictates if we can keep them a lot of the time restaurants suffer with oh we have a lot of
*  one-time diner they can because of instagram the food is instagramable but actually it doesn't taste
*  amazing so what is the reason for them to come back that goes beyond social media what is the
*  new dish oh it looks like we have a uh young uh so in chinese umami has half fish and has half lamb
*  so this is a dish with full umami with our fish ball and lamb stew okay i heard about that as a
*  shanghai dish and when i first heard about lamb and fish stew i did not quite believe it as a real
*  have you been converted i i have been converted i think it's awesome
*  maybe you should go okay yes please and also again we were talking about the importance of
*  soup this is a proper chinese meal with a soup it's not just one soup it's courses of soups
*  right and a nice soupy dish here sorry where in china have you not eaten the food i have never
*  been to jangxi province also one place i really want to go is heilongjiang in the donbei northeast
*  there it's sort of bordering russia and that's going to be a whole other um you know a lot of
*  local ingredients and traditions and a bit of russian influence so a very good restaurant in
*  dulhuac right on the border of north korea that has a very very strong north korean chinese
*  cuisine combination and it's the only place you can go to get that particular food yeah i mean
*  that's again the diversity of chinese cuisine that you don't only have the sort of branches
*  of classical chinese gastronomy but also you said in yunnan you have food that is like vietnamese
*  tai laoshan and then in the northeast korean russian i mean it's very extraordinary mongolian
*  shenyang i quite like the food spicier than i was expecting it to be right wonderful dumplings
*  maybe the best dumplings i'd had in china oh yeah there are there are kind of shenyang
*  dumping restaurants on there in other places too yeah since korea was mentioned my korean friend
*  has a theory that a lot of perhaps most of sort of global variation in cuisine can just be explained
*  by temperature in different countries in particular that you know western and northern europe it's too
*  cold to cook outdoors and if you're cooking indoors and you don't want to poison yourself
*  from the fumes or the smoke you have to rely a lot more on covered pots and cooking vessels
*  that rely on less they create kind of less smoky flavorful dishes what yeah how do you kind of
*  think about the geography or temperature of a place is as variable i was trying to think the
*  sort of so chinese wok cooking does create a lot of smoke and so on but i mean in lots of
*  chinese modern apartments they would have a kitchen that's almost like a balcony
*  that's where you can open all the windows so you don't actually influence the place where
*  people are sitting and eating but it's adjacent right but i suppose in yeah in the north donbay
*  north you have lots of hearty stews and soups so maybe to an extent very interesting question
*  the so chinese say they need to eat a lot of spicy foods because it's such a humid
*  and hot environment i've never understood that but what actually why is that helping with it
*  makes you sweat so you have to because it's humid you have this unhealthy dampness in your body
*  so you have to have ginger chilies peppercorns to make you sweat and that drives out the
*  the unhealthy humidity and restores a lovely equilibrium yeah but i mean the funny thing
*  about that that i that is a little inconsistent is that the cantonese south is also pretty humid
*  it seems to me and yet chilies are not advised there for eating but sweet water is
*  oh yes that's true yes you do other things for the this is a lovely texture too with the sort
*  of slithery crisp wood ear mushrooms yes as well you've noted very well fuchsia that chinese
*  cuisine has a bit of an elitist bias these eight great great cuisines are very much concentrated
*  in the more rich coastal provinces i wonder can you gesture towards what a people's history of
*  chinese cuisine could look like you know what how do we actually incorporate these folk traditions
*  a little bit better into our conception of chinese food so it is not so cantonese and
*  jangnan focused well i think so the first thing to say is the eight great cuisines is a very
*  recent scheme you know people talk about it as if it was something really old but i think it only
*  i've said in my book but i think it only goes back to about 1980 or something and so there are
*  many different ways of trying to express the regional diversity of chinese food all of them
*  totally inadequate because it's such a sort of intricate patchwork but but i think already as
*  you said jangnan which is the food of the eastern sort of region around shanghai very elitist fine
*  cantonese food is very elitist but such when he's already has a reputation for being a sort of hearty
*  folk cuisine right so it is represented the eight great cuisines um incorporates like anhui which
*  is not regarded as a very great culinary region now and i think it's the categorization of that
*  scheme is actually quite irrelevant and it doesn't i think if people took a fresh look at it they
*  would include um and also in the eight great cuisines hunan cuisine is one of them but that
*  they're talking about elitist hunan food and not the wonderful spicy home cooking so i mean i think
*  in terms of what people actually want to eat it's not elitist right so the cuisines that are most
*  popular now such one what else hunan no the spicy wines are more spicy ones yeah guizhou is also
*  and that's not an elitist cuisine so um i think that you know the people writing about food are
*  no longer the sort of confucian gentleman scholars are they so it's why is hunan food fallen behind
*  in the west so you used to have so many restaurants that claimed to be szechuan hunan you know they
*  weren't really either one but nominally there was some connection and now people many more people
*  want real chinese food there's plenty of more or less broadly authentic szechuan places but i
*  don't see broadly authentic hunan places what happened not so many um i don't know i mean what
*  do you think um my understanding was that hunan food became quite popular after nixon's visit to
*  china and you know this was all chairman mao and then everybody just started advertising their
*  chinese restaurants as hunanese cuisine i think that kind of shaped distorted our view and so
*  maybe people have caught on personally i enjoy hunan food a little bit less than szechuan food i
*  find hunan food a little bit too oily and the flavors are a little bit too much instead of more
*  refined and tingling and teasing in a way that's the trend often is lydia do you have a view on
*  this are you tempted to serve hunan dishes yes may i introduce you what we're having this is a sam
*  special but it's not fair to serve it only to sam that's why our table gets a separate platter
*  this is um chef peter's signature uh dish it's a dry fried egg plant
*  he has done so many ingredients the dry fried way we call him a dry fried master he can do it
*  with fish he can do it with shrimp with okra with cauliflower with shiitake mushroom it's the special
*  batter that he coat anything with makes it very crispy outside but still like juicy and tender
*  inside with great balance of cilantro Sichuan pepper sometimes he likes to add cumin other times
*  it's um just a lot of flavors if you think about all the family empire how many restaurants is it
*  now i stopped counting stop coming exactly obviously the food is wonderful but in terms of business
*  principles what has made the difference what have you all done that has been the difference maker
*  viewing them as commercial enterprises all right i have to start with the things that
*  we have tried but not in a way financially successful is we keep trying to uh offer new
*  concepts we wanted to in a way offer modernized chinese cuisine you know people will call that
*  more fusion or not really as authentic this is something i really want to ask the people sitting
*  on the dining table so when it comes to comes to the tradition the classics the authenticity
*  versus modern ambience what is the balance what is your ratio when it comes to like if i'm going
*  to pick a place for a meal what do you guys look for floor is open i don't think i'm a very
*  usual diner so i don't care that much for ambience usually i like a very
*  dull place because oftentimes especially with the i love filipino food also and because it usually
*  is very the meower location just go in everyone's is a family restaurant so they cook everything
*  very simple homemade done and you go in they don't have time for the other aspects of it
*  but i know when you go to those kind of places the only other people there are other filipinos
*  and similarly because right now i live in live in madrid and oftentimes the best chinese
*  restaurants i find actually mostly hondanese actually are just very simple restaurants and
*  that's usually where the most people from hunan typically go and have food but the ones that look
*  very nice very objective thanks typically cater to just the average consumer and because of that
*  they don't really tend to put that much effort on the food but you know that's a multiply thing
*  would prefer a nice looking restaurant i am against nice looking restaurants because it
*  attracts too much instagramming yeah i'm there for the food and we were there for the food
*  you know we don't want the photos well one of one of the key tenants in the tarla karen theory of
*  how to select a restaurant is looking for spelling mistakes on the menu very good thing
*  yeah similarly i think some combination of chinese clientele not a particularly nice venue
*  and i think just kind of i guess also when you're in a restaurant typically if in the uk if the
*  service is kind of not as warm and i guess polite you like to be treating me yeah that's usually a
*  very strong signal about the food being good and i find that to be very true i don't think you should
*  take any of this advice but exactly so this is a constant debate well i mean fuchsia will probably
*  uh what do you look for do you look for the a dining room full of at least 90 Chinese audience
*  well i think having a chinese audience is a good sign and but i like everything and i sometimes i
*  like to go to beautiful places with amazing service and beautiful china and elegant presentation
*  and sometimes i like to go and have street food and that's the joy of eating and of chinese food
*  that you have something at every level yeah and i think also just this thing about classics versus
*  innovation you know all the classics are actually the product of innovation somebody was saying to
*  me the other day you know mapo tofu it's only 100 years old you know it's not an ancient dish the
*  situanese didn't have chilies until a couple hundred years ago and um so i think you you know
*  you can't be too conservative really i like it when the diners are grumpy when they're too happy
*  i start to get suspicious like why are they here they're here to have a good time there's something
*  about food you mentioned sex earlier when you film people doing it that don't necessarily look happy
*  wow so it's true i shouldn't take any of this advice for fuchsia who is maybe closer to
*  our day-to-day customer it is absolutely true when it comes to a business success is we look
*  at what brings people back so yes you can have a very peacocky showy um dish that maybe lights up
*  in flame or you know something that's people look at it they're like wow i want to see what they're
*  really like but once they are in the door you know we think about what makes them stay it really goes
*  down to the ingredients the their personal feelings you know some of you guys like to be
*  treated in a new way maybe that's a strong association with um how you're being treated
*  but i believe um there is a lot of perception about chinese cuisine we're trying to make a
*  change too and again i know that everyone on this table is a um foodie and takes a lot of pride on
*  standard and quality we're trying to expand that audience we want anyone that doesn't know much
*  about chinese cooking coming to a restaurant and feel good about being here it's not just them it's
*  everyone they're eating it with yes our dining room is a little loud but we tend to you know offer
*  them appetizers before the entree comes out and we offer them a little like um matcha or ice cream
*  at the end of the meal kind of in a way fill them make them feel comfortable and familiar
*  with what they're eating otherwise you know we stay pretty true on the flavors we like to offer
*  both flavors especially how dad started his career in the u.s it's really not afraid of using
*  peppercorn at the time it was banned in the u.s there's no legal way of getting peppercorn or
*  source it i remember the restaurant owner would ask their family member in china to send it over
*  from fujian so yes things have changed quite a lot in the past 20 30 years and now we're looking
*  at oh there's a lot of options what is from a business perspective what makes us different
*  that we get customer to come back for occasions special celebration or for their day-to-day
*  carry out a delivery tell us about the new dish and should one eat it with chopsticks
*  everyone should eat with chopsticks yes we have a pork belly dish that is um from start
*  marinated and then coated with rice flour after it's steamed and cooked 80 90 percent then we
*  wanted to create a crispy texture that's when we start to put in the wok very quick double sides
*  pan sear and then add all the green jalapeno the scallion the red chili pepper
*  peppercorns this is my favorite dish so far this and the numbing beef but fuchsia would you comment
*  on this i was just thinking this is the first time so this thing when you marinate the pork belly and
*  you coat it in rice crumbs and you steam it is a very classic chinese country dish and it's the
*  first time i've had it fried like this and it's delicious it's a sort of um like a new version of
*  hui guo rou back in the pot pork twice cooked pork if i can ask um this is a dish that is very
*  known in the household family when you have um something steamed like at home my mom or my
*  grandma will steam it for the first time and serve it as a beautiful first time dish but for
*  something to be consumed later in the day or the next day people tend to get tired of eating the
*  same thing over and over so they get really smart on why don't we pan sear it so it becomes a new
*  dish we're gonna have to try it yeah liddy are you seeing a difference between chinese restaurants
*  in the dc area in the la area and the new york area is there a distinct difference with
*  these things or they're just kind of you know sutra restaurants or something in each of these
*  places they're kind of consistent i feel like um restaurants or restaurant owners are very smart
*  to see what the trend is as you guys can probably see sutra restaurant you know if we're talking
*  about in the 2000 but there has there has not been many um and that's probably how that got
*  his reputation on being a master sutra chef although he's really a classic train chinese chef
*  cooking all the regional cuisines i want to say ever started in the 2010 ish this is when the
*  new immigration from china started to merging a lot of them went to la a lot that a lot of them
*  went to new york a lot of them came to dc so we're starting to see um not in orange county we see
*  jelly which is a very um jiangsu zhejiangcai in new york and i'm just naming a few there's actually
*  a lot more original cuisine like some um i remember my friend chef simon tong was making
*  vienna noodles by nyu and it's vastly popular sam any comment on the eggplant
*  um it's very good vergus rashid what's been your favorite dish so far
*  oh um the eggplant has been very good actually um i've also liked the the scallions of an excellent
*  i think i'll go with the pork this one this one yeah why
*  i usually like a very subtle ma tingling sensation usually that's not kind of overpowering
*  and also the combination with the fry is very very good if you had to pick a favorite so far
*  do you have a nomination well so for me i love the pork and i love that soup with the fish balls
*  and but for me the reason this is such a lovely meal is that it's such a well-planned menu and
*  this is the thing that i think foreigners have the most difficulty with with chinese food is how
*  to assemble a menu and you've really thought about different cooking methods different ingredients
*  textures some wet some dry and that's what makes it not only delicious but also shufu comfortable
*  because we have this you know something very sizzling and then a lovely light refreshing
*  soup so the pleasure of the meal is sort of physical as well as just i mean yeah and how
*  did you learn that just by induction you were served a lot of meals and you ran the mental
*  regressions is there a way it can be taught to someone like you well mainly i've learned
*  through just constant eating but yeah i think i mean i try to write about this really and the
*  idea that you know a well-planned chinese menu it's not just about delicious tastes and i think
*  if you think about going out for a classic french meal you think about having lots of rich food
*  pudding cheese and feeling quite heavy afterwards with a well-planned chinese meal you can have
*  dozens of dishes and still feel comfortable but i think it's just you know as a foreigner once you
*  start considering that the the light and delicate dishes are just as important as the razzle dazzle
*  exciting dishes then you're on the way to be able to plan a nice meal right i would say start with
*  picking out your favorites and look at oh what am i missing from there and that's a good way to go
*  and your father taught you i guess so i am very influenced by both great chefs at home mom and
*  dad's mom is a pastry chef that is a work chef and i they train me to have a very picky palette
*  but i think also it's just yeah it's about not repetition right that's the key thing so if you
*  have a dish with one ingredient or one style you just want to make sure the other ones are as
*  contrasting as possible on the subject of fuchsia's writing i think that your book is wonderfully well
*  organized to have 30 to introduce the cuisine through 30 dishes and to use that to talk about
*  knife work and the diversity and everything else i thought it worked really well and furthermore
*  what worked well was that you are just a fabulous writer in terms of making the physicality of
*  eating very very good can you speak a little bit about you know is food writing this is i think it
*  really rewards food really rewards good writing can you talk about how you learn that other craft
*  that you've picked up so well well thank you very much um i don't know how i mean it's just
*  instinct and trying to i mean i suppose what i've been trying to do all this time is find ways of
*  describing the intricacies of chinese food to make it so illuminating and delightful for people who
*  didn't grow up with it and so trying to find ways things like texture which is a quite difficult
*  subject in the sense that many of our texture words in english are a bit disgusting slimy
*  grisly but trying to write sort of playfully and engagingly so that people can both sort of
*  acknowledge these unfamiliar textures but also see how they might be delicious i did a degree in
*  english literature so i read lots of good books which is the best training for any writer but i
*  think also i just try to have fun with it um you know to just be playful and have a laugh and also
*  i just i love eating and i have since i was a teenager i've always kept a journal and it's
*  always turned into sort of epic descriptions of meals so i've had a lot of practice when you
*  worked for bbc world service you learned how to write then or before well i mean i suppose i've
*  always written i mean you know i had a certain training for for how to think about language
*  and try to trying to be very fair and thinking how it will be in you know how it will be understood
*  in different cultures but i think more of it is just practice just writing having a notebook
*  writing your impressions and it's just a craft that you develop through use yeah what did your
*  parents do um so my mother taught english as a foreign language so she had a huge food influence
*  on me so um she's a great cook and we always had lots of foreign friends in our home so i had a
*  very unusual gastronomic upbringing and my father was in sort of the first generation of it people
*  um there's a bit of anxiety i get when i go to a new choice restaurant because i feel like when you
*  want the good food you have to perform you have to perform yourself you're gonna say
*  laoban i i'm here to actually consume the correct food but people who can't just you know turn on
*  some chung cha dialect how would they actually get the good food from the restaurants well so
*  without the language or yeah i mean i suppose that one of the best ways is to look at what other
*  people are eating um but it is difficult and even when i go to china and i order for a group
*  in good bandarine knowledgeably and i know the names of the dishes and it so often happens that
*  the waiter will say if i'm with foreigners he'll say oh they can't possibly eat that so there's
*  the sort of assumption that foreigners won't be able to handle certain foods and i've sometimes
*  have to have an argument and just say look we will eat it and we have gone around proving that
*  we can eat sea cucumbers and stuff you know on many occasions but i think and it's quite
*  understandable because i think a lot of foreigners have a habit of ordering something that they can't
*  handle and then being rude and obnoxious and just complaining or they think that there's a you know
*  there's a bone in the chicken so that's a problem it's not a problem it's meant to be like that
*  so i think that chinese um waiting stuff particularly in the west but also
*  in china a little wary of upsetting foreigners and also they just want people to have a nice time
*  so you have to battle against that stereotype if you really want to eat the good food but um but i
*  think you know i think things are changing and i think but i think just looking at what other
*  people are eating is incredibly useful and then also showing your appreciation when you do eat
*  something unusual because i have a you know i should imagine that all the restaurants where
*  i've been with groups of foreigners eating unusual things with gusto that afterwards they thought
*  well you know it is possible for foreigners to do something what is it then that you can't eat put
*  aside the illegal uh but where you just say like no i'm not going to have that no i will eat
*  everything you will eat everything well i did in yunnan actually i did eat some there's a very
*  special dish in one particular region which is raw pork like a sort of tartar pork shanky dali
*  shanky and um i ate that um because i was you know local people rave about it and he's short time
*  and i was aware that there are health issues with eating raw pork but i really wanted to try it
*  and so i had it with some local friends it was really delicious but i had this terrible panic
*  afterwards and i kept you know and i probably wouldn't do that again but i think it's a really
*  hard thing like i want to eat with people and i want to be totally open-minded and non-judgmental
*  and um and then yeah so i suppose it's just the only things that will restrain me are possibly
*  sort of health concerns like that and then also sort of ethical issues but i have a real dilemma
*  with hairy crabs so this is one of the great delicacies of the jangnan region and oh they're
*  so and one of the best ways to eat them is their drunken crabs and they're sort of pickled in
*  rice wine and seasonings and it's just like you just fly to heaven when you eat one and and i've
*  been eating these for years with great delight and then a couple of years ago a few years ago
*  the shanghai authorities where they're a great jealousy they banned raw drunken crabs and um so
*  i started sort of looking at why this was and it turns out that they can carry parasites freshwater
*  raw creatures so now you know somebody offers me a raw hairy crab what do i do you know i've been
*  fine so far and um but i don't know that the sort of lust for eating them is so great the only live ones
*  why aren't there more raw dishes in chinese food overall well i mean historical prejudice so in
*  you know in ancient china the chinese defined themselves as people who ate cooked food and
*  barbarians beyond the borders of the empire ate raw food and so there is this idea that a very
*  ancient idea going back to the book of rights leegi one of the classic texts that um you know
*  civilization began when people learned how to harness fire to cook their food and they left
*  behind the era of eating drinking blood and eating feathers and having all the diseases from raw
*  food so there is a sort of idea that you know i remember when um i took a hunanese friend out
*  for dinner in london and she was served a rare pigeon breast you know her initial reaction was
*  anxiety is this going to be a bit dangerous so it's a sort of health concerns coupled with
*  an ancient tradition of eating cooked food i spent about three months in dali last year and i was
*  offered a lot of raw pork and i never took it right probably very sensible it was very nice
*  it was like i mean it was a bit like a steak tata but you'll eat raw meat in the u.s or i would eat
*  raw beef sure yeah pork i don't know but i think like um in in germany i think it's i don't know
*  if it's a certain region they have met which is raw pork but when you eat this it's um there are
*  all kinds of rules and regulations for the temperature which it's kept and how it's served
*  and so on whereas in dali i mean it was very very kind of easy but the fact is that local people of
*  this particular group eat it all the time and i was fast i was always asking people if they had
*  any problems and most people say oh it's fine you know they check the pork it's fine so
*  when and where is china most effective as a street food country and when isn't it so i don't i don't
*  eat much street food when i'm in china why not but i might say in malaysia the restaurant food is so
*  good yeah and i've never found the street food to be better even though it can be very good
*  whereas say in malaysia i might find street food on average to be better than restaurant food
*  is there anywhere in china where street food is the way to go
*  oh well um yeah in the north in i went to kaifeng the old song dynasty northern capital
*  and they had this is some years ago but they had the most incredible night market with all kinds
*  of food and that was just amazing and delicious and then i've had good i mean i think the problem is
*  that um you know with china's modernization there's been this big effort to clean up the
*  streets and they've they've seen sort of street food as being old-fashioned and something
*  undesirable and so like when i lived in sechuan in the beginning there were actually quite a lot
*  of street traders doing really nice food and it's harder to find them but actually in so if you go
*  to chengdu go to the wenchu monastery and in the streets around there there are people serving some
*  traditional snacks these little pancakes stuffed with sweet things um yeah yeah these are lovely
*  so i would go there there are certain areas where it's tolerated and where you can have really
*  lovely street food yeah diane do you have a view on this basically anywhere with a night market
*  i think is reliably the places with great street food um and especially these nice little barbecues
*  and noodles um i'd echo uh fuchsia here that shanghai i believe used to have actually quite
*  a nice street food uh life and then they cleaned all of that up and i think they've maybe have been
*  borderline successful in driving that out and then sometimes what they do is they
*  they bring street food into an area a bit like the singaporean hawker center idea
*  but the problem is that they're not individual traders anymore they're just people working for
*  someone else and it's not really not really the kind of really good street food lydia what do we
*  have here i think we missed our seafood pro with sticky rice and that's a dish that everyone took
*  and it's now gone so that's a very typical hubei cuisine um we like to use pork as a filling but
*  for today's um variety that switch to crab and seafood um and coated with sticky rice steamed and
*  just finishing up with a beautiful glaze and next we have the famous squirrel fish um today i think
*  they're more daisy looking or sometimes amazing knife work look at that yes you know cut like
*  that and they're not falling apart they're all staying in these lovely fronds that's right
*  okay thank you no episode of conversations with tyler would be complete without
*  a implication or understanding that everything comes back to economics what can it what can
*  an economist learn from eating more chinese food you're asking me either anybody i have no idea
*  a competition works b adam smith said division of labor is limited by the extent of the market
*  so as chinese became the number one group coming to the united states he started getting a lot of
*  regional cuisine but also look for places that are not too easy to get to not frequented by
*  too many tourists and have grumpy diners and abusive staff because there's a selection effect
*  if the place is in business at all and it's full that's implying the food is very good it's being
*  patronized often by elderly chinese who in my view are much faster than a lot of younger chinese
*  younger chinese in this country sort of by my standards are too willing to go out to eat
*  to enjoy themselves and i just think that's wrong uh those would be my starting points but other
*  answers are welcome trade promotes globalization so trying food is slightly easier to export as
*  fuchsia said given the chilies and the peppercorns that's why it's really easy to have that standardized
*  across the world when when fuchsia mentioned that the the willingness for the government to try to
*  standardize cuisine did it really work you kind of see this ability of the individual to kind of
*  design and many themselves it's a very big aspect of you know big economic concept there
*  slightly different question for fuchsia i'm wondering you you write in your book about how
*  the the west i guess the anglosphere in particular had this experience with chinese food coming and
*  i guess in the post-war period when um essentially what they ended up what you end up getting in a
*  takeaway is not real kind of proper chinese food um so i guess do you have a sense of other regions
*  other continents of the world have they had a similar experience with chinese food coming
*  there or maybe some of you haven't even had it yet oh well i mean i think yes i think that the
*  sort of cantonese simplified model is in many places but with slight variation so like in
*  sweden they have something called four little dishes which is like a standard menu of chinese
*  takeaway food um yeah and i think that it seems to have been a blueprint that worked very well
*  all over the place um yeah with sweet tastes and fried foods and with with variations but i have
*  to say i mean i haven't traveled to peru for example where they have i by all accounts a very
*  interesting yeah local chinese food and also calcutta has some very interesting old chinese
*  dishes and i have yet to go there so both of those are very good but they're very different
*  yes they don't feel to me like white chinese food but i would recommend them chifas which you even
*  can get in northern virginia though it's much better in peru oh really but they're like rice
*  dishes with chinese elements in them is the way i would think about them i spent some time in
*  barcelona this summer and i found first of all barcelona to be i think the my favorite city for
*  food in europe in part because i think it has a very great respect for asian cuisine this was the
*  first european country i've seen where there were a lot of spanish chefs making chinese food
*  spanish chefs making japanese food and i thought that it was um quite good where is the best
*  city in europe for chinese food is it london i mean i haven't done a survey so i have no idea
*  but um yeah but if somewhere were great you would have been pulled to it right
*  well i hope so but i mean i'm spoiled because i eat a lot in china so you know i don't feel the
*  need to go and eat chinese food everywhere else i feel like singapore has really good chinese food
*  because of the chinese population um like yeah london has great chinese food not just um you
*  know the china town that has been there for maybe uh decades but also the newer where i like to call
*  chinese we talk about um chef wang indy wang uh yeah really doing an excellent um idea with
*  elevated chinese foods um being tasting menu but i think one problem and this maybe comes back to
*  economics again that in england for example i think now the door has opened to massive public
*  interest in regional chinese food and people are really you know open to trying now eating such one
*  food and so on but the real problem is that we have very stringent um immigration rules so in
*  order for uh you know a chef to come over and work in a restaurant in london they have to have a
*  certain level of english and a certain income which is prohibitive for anyone but the big
*  international hotels and i think it's a shame that we don't have more trained chefs coming in um from
*  china to bring different aspects of chinese i find that the chinese food in madrid is actually even
*  better than barcelona you spend much time in madrid the trains i think because even there you get
*  very very obscure local cuisine from china is also in madrid where in barcelona it's not as
*  you know you can't get the obscurity as much this book other books you've written what's the hardest
*  thing for you about writing a book um well i found this a lot harder than writing a cookbook
*  why um because a cookbook has a slightly obvious structure so unless you're going to do something
*  really radical you have a sort of introduction you know you can go into basic techniques and
*  ingredients then you have recipes often grouped by ingredient and each recipe has a head note
*  so the structure by now i've done a few cookbooks it's fairly straightforward
*  um with a narrative book it can be anything you want so i you know i start with a vague idea that
*  i want to talk about some of the great themes of chinese gastronomy and cuisine and then it's sort
*  of how to organize it it's a bit frightening because i felt that i was starting with much
*  more of a blank page than with a cookbook yeah what's your most unusual successful work habit
*  um getting on a train and what do you do then no if i mean through china or just get on a british
*  train and you write if i got on a british train and you cook if i have a blog a writing blog and
*  i just i'm frustrated and i feel i can't possibly do it and i just give up if i get moving and get
*  on a train then for some reason my mind starts loosening up and i have a breakthrough
*  um also sitting in cafes but just change of scene so moving and not moving or you're no no
*  being somewhere getting away from being the solitary writer at your computer at your desk
*  and sort of that breaks the deadlock but i have i have to say i mean yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't
*  put myself off as a model of effective and you know efficient working but i want to say you finish
*  your book on time i remember meeting you last year in london you said you were writing this book and
*  you have a very strict deadline and look at well where we are well i did have the the advantage of
*  a global pandemic which meant that i wasn't racing around the world but i had to stay home
*  other than china now that it's quite easy to travel where else do you want to go for food
*  i'd like to go back to japan you know people sometimes think i know about asian food and
*  i really don't because i've been so concentrated on china and i went to japan for the first time
*  in 2018 and i have only dipped my little finger into that particular pie and so i would love to
*  go and it's so interesting because obviously it relates to chinese food and you see some
*  words and processes and things that have died out in china that are still in japan expressed
*  differently so it's kind of related but fascinatingly different for me i was there a few weeks ago i had
*  one chinese meal for breakfast it was quite good just amazing sushi anywhere without even looking
*  for it yeah some people would say that japan now has the best french cooking some of the best
*  italian cooking now i'm skeptical that they can have the best chinese cooking but i don't think
*  they do i've been to michelin star chinese restaurants in tokyo they're very good they
*  deserve their stars but i think say compared to qingdu or somewhere they'd only be middling
*  is it because there's no grumpy diners they're cooking for michelin diners who do have good taste
*  but it's a little rarefied and at the visceral level there's just something a bit missing i
*  found but it seems so this is a very superficial impression because i wasn't there for very long
*  but it seemed to me that japan also has the old school chinatown cooking and newer cooking
*  but one meal that i wrote about in this book a chinese meal was actually cooked
*  that stir-fry chapter i went to one small chinese modern restaurant where the chinese technique
*  and the sort of sensibility and aesthetics were very chinese and it was absolutely superb yeah
*  so that that was just a little snapshot but it was a very interesting yeah chinese food cooked in
*  and served at a sort of bar like a sushi counter actually lidia where do you think it's going to
*  for food obviously there's maybe other reasons to travel oh my god well i'm dying to go to peru
*  for the food but also for the nature scene machu bichiro and i want to say i haven't really explored
*  much of mexico i feel like it's so close to home where we live but it's underrated i was only in
*  mexico city the first time this august with my then nine month year daughter we explored the city
*  from pastries in the morning great coffee shops to we haven't really had a lot of opportunity to
*  explore the street tacos but the dining scene the restaurants are truly amazing with both flavors
*  yes and then i would say southeast asia for me i guess maybe more the street food that i find
*  quite thrilling i've had quite a lot of refined chinese food and now it's more it's a it's a street
*  food now for me and i have not spent mexico at all and i think that mexico is hugely exciting
*  rural mexico in particular is one of my all-time favorites for me it's on a par with china i love
*  mexico city it's incredible but just side of the road dishes in small towns or on the edge of
*  mid-sized towns for me that's the best food in mexico and i will do that in life until i can't do
*  it anymore and i've been to mexico over 30 times and every meal is a wonder in the way that it is
*  in china and can be in india but not too many other places i love japan but japan also has a lot of
*  the worst food now i don't go there to eat it but it can be disgusting or the desserts or
*  i think japan has very high variance of food even though all of it is well done by its standards
*  sometimes i think they are pursuing the wrong standards what explains that variation they
*  pursue perfection and in a way achieve it but if you don't agree with all matters of taste
*  pursuing perfection in a sense can be a negative so if you look at these filipino desserts which
*  for me are too sweet they're too gooey they're too large too many different things piled on top of
*  each other but they're quite popular there are people who love them i don't think they're wrong
*  to love them japan just takes every direction you can imagine and perfects it and that's a
*  little dangerous and i won't eat raw chicken in japan speaking of things you know that i don't eat
*  to me i don't know that i'm afraid i trust that it's safe i just think it would disgust me
*  and that's irrational but there i am and what else i can get is so good
*  nominations from this side of the room i've only been to china once so i think i'd love to go back
*  um i was in chongqing um i think i mean for all the reasons you just mentioned like there's
*  i think an endless amount of things to sort of discover and kind of seems to mine there
*  um well i've never been to china so that's the obvious answer i think ethiopia is still very
*  underrated when it comes to food when you've been there for the first time this year and it was
*  blew me away so i want to go back for sure and try a lot more ethiopian dishes what struck you
*  in particular the spice combinations that was the quickly quick quick answer um
*  some of the combos are so odd i can't describe them properly and i say it's the only closest
*  thing it reminds me of is like some some peruvian spices for example
