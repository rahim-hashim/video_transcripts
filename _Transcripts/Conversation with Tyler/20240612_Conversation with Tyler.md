Video Description: You could try playing out the four-dimensional chess game of how the global order will shift in the next 10-15 years for yourself, or you could hire Velina Tchakarova. Founder of the consultancy FACE, Velina is a geopolitical strategist guiding businesses and organizations to anticipate the outcomes of global conflicts, shifting alliances, and bleeding edge technologies on the world stage.

In a globe-trotting conversation, Tyler and Velina start in the Balkans and then head to Russia, China, North Korea, and finally circle back to Putin’s interest in the Baltics. She gives her take on whether the Balkan Wars still matter today, the future of Bulgarian nationalism, what predicts which Eastern European countries will remain closer to Russia, why China will not attack Taiwan, Putin’s next move after Ukraine, where a nuclear weapon is most likely to be used next, how she sources intel, her unique approach to scenario-planning, and more.

# Velina Tchakarova on China, Russia, and the Future of Geopolitics  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjBASiWgtQA)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm very happy to be chatting with Velina Chakrova, who is a geopolitical strategist
*  with long-standing experience.
*  She is founder of a group FACE, which stands for For A Conscious Experience.
*  I first learned of Velina by reading her on Twitter.
*  Velina, welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you very much for being with you and I look forward to a highly interesting conversation.
*  Now you're from Bulgaria, so I've long wondered, the First and Second Balkan Wars, the preceded
*  World War I, do they still matter today or what did we learn from them?
*  Well, of course they matter in a sense because you are probably familiar with the term Balkanization
*  and unfortunately the term Balkanization, that means splitting a country into smaller
*  parts in order for external powers to interfere, to play different political actors off against
*  each other and that kind of thing is still very much relevant and it's being used and
*  applied to other regions, to other parts of the world.
*  It matters also in terms of sentiments and in terms of moods.
*  If you take a look at the political landscape in most of the Balkan countries, we still
*  call our region the Balkan region even though outsiders describe it as South-East Europe
*  mostly.
*  You will find all of these sentiments being reflected in various political groups and
*  parties.
*  We have nationalists in most of these countries which are getting stronger by the day and
*  are running for elections and are using actually agenda and narratives that have been known
*  for the last 200 years.
*  All in all it's unfortunately quite relevant.
*  Let me use another example.
*  The incident, the helicopter crash from yesterday where the Iranian president and the foreign
*  minister passed away was used as an example by some analysts already.
*  I will just use the reference here that it could be the next arrival moment.
*  Again, we have Balkan wars and then we had also the biggest black swan as being described
*  by Professor Nassim Taleb, the Sarajevo moment from 1914 that was an unanticipated event
*  which eventually resulted in the First World War.
*  Even now this reference is being used as Sarajevo moment is something that is defined as a black
*  swan event and that could lead to a major military conflict if not even another world
*  war.
*  All in all these kind of things are still kind of relevant even though they are not
*  of course influence or scale as it used to be the case 200 years ago.
*  Bulgarian nationalism in the past as you know it's so often been about dreams of a greater
*  Bulgaria and there are Bulgarian minorities in Albania, different parts of the Balkans
*  and this notion of creating something like a Bulgarian world or San Stefano Bulgaria
*  with larger borders but with current demographic collapse in Bulgaria, migration to the EU,
*  low birth rates.
*  What is the future of Bulgarian nationalism?
*  Does it have a future at all?
*  I think that the second part of the question is easier to be answered.
*  Yes, nationalism as I already outlined is always going to have some sort of a solid ground
*  in the whole region including Bulgaria and again right now we have a very strong nationalistic
*  sentiment that is also finding a political reflection and we have elections in June
*  for a parliament since the coalition government between the conservatives and the liberals
*  has went parted ways.
*  To the first part of your question, these sentiments will be politicized and instrumentalized
*  but they will not find a common denominator among the population in Bulgaria.
*  The dream of San Stefano Bulgaria or if you like big Bulgaria including parts of other
*  countries' neighbors is over.
*  This is not going to come back specifically in the case of Bulgaria.
*  I would argue actually in the case of the other neighbors as well unless we see a major
*  process that right now I don't see happening in the short term of let's say the disolvenment
*  of the European Union because so long as these countries are part of the European Union or
*  candidates for the European Union, these kind of conflicts will always find a kind of solution
*  mechanism within the institutions and there will be enough incentives for broader part
*  of the parties and actors to find a common denominator.
*  Countries like North Macedonia and we saw that there were immediately a kind of a verbal
*  conflict between North Macedonia and Greece because the newly elected president of North
*  Macedonia didn't use the full name but used only the name of Macedonia.
*  This kind of sensitivities will remain but again they do not find a common denominator
*  even in these countries.
*  Going back to the demographics, I think this is a bigger issue because right now probably
*  the most famous person right now who is making the case, the strong case of shrinking demographics
*  all over the world with a few exceptions of course because Africa and Southeast Asia will
*  still see at macro level kind of positive demographics but in general Bulgaria is probably
*  one of the fastest shrinking, demographically shrinking countries in the world not just
*  in Europe and here we have a very very serious issue that is a systematic and a structural
*  issue that goes back to 30 years of political mismanagement, corruption and precarious I
*  would say socio-economic indicator so it's not just about the missing birth rates, it's
*  also about the skyrocketing death rates in this country and more or less 3 million, 3.5
*  million people who have sought their happiness and tried to find their luck outside of the
*  country which is quite telling.
*  Are the countries in the Balkans the right size?
*  Are there too many of them?
*  So if we go back to the Balkan wars, well first Bulgaria and a number of other countries
*  take from the Ottoman Empire, then you turn around and basically a year later countries
*  take from Bulgaria.
*  Is there any stability in that region without an outside hegemon?
*  There is a stability outside the influence exercised by hegemon for instance through
*  the balance of several external powers.
*  This is the case right now.
*  So we do not have a hegemonic power in the region right now.
*  We have let's say if you like a balance act of several external and very powerful actors.
*  That's not just the European Union with its geo-economic clout.
*  It's also Russia still very much active in the region and we have also Turkey which is
*  also of course quite active and we have the United States and China also trying to play
*  their leverage in the region.
*  So you see that it's not one specific hegemon.
*  That's always been the case by the way if you would like to go back to the Balkan wars,
*  if you would like to go back to previous periods of the Balkan region, you would find out that
*  once again it was a competition of several empires and each of these empires was trying
*  to get a chunk of this region for itself and practically through this balancing act,
*  these small states were trying to capitalize on their own interests and this is a continuum,
*  a geopolitical continuum that is still very much in play in this region.
*  Why do you think it is said that Bulgaria and Serbia remain closer to Russia even with
*  Putin or if you compare Czechia and Slovakia, Slovakia seems much closer to Russia or at
*  least some parts of Slovakia than Czechia does.
*  What predicts which nations in Eastern Europe will have this attraction to the East?
*  First and foremost I would say it's cyclical.
*  It's not just you don't have a recipe that reflects on the realities on the ground one
*  on one.
*  You have very strong cultural, personal, cultural and historical roots.
*  Of course specifically in this region you have religious and also post-imperial roots.
*  In the case of the Russian Empire there has been, I would argue that what we see right
*  now with Russia is a continuum of the Russian Empire DNA.
*  Practically I use this golden rule of the closer the better in terms of influence and
*  in terms of penetration and subversion the closer to the core the bigger the influence.
*  We saw this clearly also during the Cold War with Bulgaria being probably the most affected
*  and highly influenced satellite with almost no saying in whatever topics.
*  At the same time if you look at the policies and actions of Soviet block satellites such
*  as Poland or Czechoslovakia at that time you will see that they had much more space to
*  act and they were prone to more turmoil, internal turmoil.
*  Even Hungary if you consider their moments of turning against the Soviet Union.
*  This hasn't been the case with Bulgaria.
*  In the case of Serbia because again you cannot use a common denominator.
*  You cannot just say that these two because they were geographically and still geographically
*  closer they would be more influenced by Russia.
*  Because in the case of Serbia being still in a very specific situation following the
*  collapse of Yugoslavia trying to find external partners that support the leadership at the
*  same time facing new realities with the buildup of the other states Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia,
*  Montenegro and so on and so forth.
*  Of course Serbia was in a dire need to have a very strong supporter and it has found the
*  supporter in the face of Russia.
*  In the Bulgarian case this is more historic.
*  It has a sentiment in the Bulgarian population even up until today that has to do with the
*  emancipation of the Bulgarian state, the third Bulgarian state following the Russian-Turkish
*  war from 1878 and then practically because of the Russian Empire Bulgaria could regain
*  its statehood and the first Tsar of Bulgaria was also practically from the Russian Empire
*  with Alexander Buttenberg.
*  We had a very different mode of let's say development and at the same time influence.
*  Today we have for instance political parties in Bulgaria that are still very much let's
*  say rooted in the same mindset that one needs an internal friendship with Russia, that this
*  is the only way forward.
*  Even on behalf of the social democrats you will find these kind of voices.
*  We have a Bulgarian president who is very much also pro-Russian even though that he
*  will deny it.
*  So you see that these kind of layers of influence and penetration to some extent are manifold.
*  You will have some that are taking place on a free base out of political convention or
*  out of individual convention but you will have also some instrumentalized influences.
*  I wouldn't use any generalization for the region except as I said this golden rule
*  that could be applicable that of course the geographic approximation is certainly an indicator
*  that will tell you a lot about how an external and powerful player would behave towards the
*  smaller neighbors and will try to of course increase its leverage via different mechanisms
*  and actions.
*  This goes through cultural ties, through personal business ties but also political and economic
*  projects so it goes also via instrumentalization of dependencies, raw materials and all of
*  these kind of things.
*  Let me give you another example just to end up this topic.
*  If you go to Serbia nowadays and ask the, just conduct a poll in the Serbian population and
*  ask who is one of the biggest investors in Serbia, a lot of people will tell you that
*  this is Russia which is actually not the case, it's not factual because still the European
*  Union is in fact the biggest institutional investor in the country but it tells you
*  a lot about perception, how Russia is being perceived in terms of its strong role in the
*  country.
*  Maybe we'll come back to Bulgaria but let me try some questions about the broader world.
*  Why is it you think China will not attack Taiwan?
*  They claim it is theirs and arguably in five to ten years they'll be able to neutralize
*  submarine advantage from the US with underwater drones and surveillance of our submarine presence.
*  At that point why don't they just move on Taiwan and try to take it?
*  Well I do understand that there is a lot of analysis coming out right now especially on
*  behalf of the military experts not only in the United States but also in other parts
*  of the world pointing to this realistic scenario that we may see a military attack by China
*  on Taiwan by not later than 2027 and why 2027 because it is being anticipated as the year
*  when China will be able to catch up militarily with the United States and I do not share
*  this assessment.
*  I just don't see why China will have to take such a big risk in achieving something that
*  it can achieve in a much smarter and more efficient way.
*  What do I mean by that?
*  I call this approach a death by a thousand cuts.
*  That would mean that China could spend a little bit longer in a slow but steady political,
*  socio-economic and societal penetration of Taiwan.
*  We could argue it's the old Soviet playbook.
*  It could be done in a more subtle way using plausible deniability.
*  It could be Taiwan is still the most successful democracy in the Indo-Pacific.
*  That means also it is vulnerable to this kind of penetration where you can practically use
*  agents provocateurs on the ground.
*  You can buy up a lot of institutional or individual players.
*  You can start doing all this subversion process in a let's say longer timeframe but it could
*  bring about bigger success than actually risking military intervention which is not
*  giving you 50-50% of success.
*  The terrain of Taiwan, if we compare it with the most sophisticated war that's going on
*  right now, is much more difficult.
*  You have a very limited window to attack.
*  In the case of Taiwan, this window of opportunity is limited to only two periods in the whole
*  year which is also known by everyone in the region.
*  That particularly means the defence of Taiwan.
*  You have a window of opportunity in April and then in October so you cannot attack at
*  any time in the year.
*  It is a sophisticated military attack that cannot be conducted on the whole of the island.
*  Even though China is catching up militarily right now, I think that the mindset of the
*  Chinese leadership, the way how the Chinese leadership is actually conducting strategy
*  does contradict such risky endeavour because time is on China's side.
*  China only needs to really prepare this sum of minor actions in a longer period of time.
*  This is what I would actually do as a strategist which would promise a much better percentage
*  of success than an adventurous military attack.
*  We may argue that under unanticipated circumstances for the political leadership, think of a situation
*  where the political stability in China is shaken, where the Chinese leader Xi Jinping
*  is somehow put into the corner to take a very ad hoc decision on the matter because of certain
*  circles of the hawks, of the military hawks.
*  Of course we have this kind of possibility as well.
*  It could be a black swan event, something that has happened in China and this makes
*  him take this decision in order to draw the attention away from internal problems.
*  Foreign policy adventures are always gathering the public support.
*  It's not 100% to be excluded but in my scenario, I would actually point to rather, as I explained
*  this death by thousand cuts approach rather than military attack on Taiwan.
*  Are we now in a world where the laws of war are basically obsolete?
*  So Putin is acting in Ukraine without restraint, killing civilians.
*  The conflict in the Middle East, whatever one might think of it, there's clearly a lot
*  of disagreement about it.
*  So the ICC, the morning of this recording, is bringing charges against Netanyahu and
*  the Israeli government.
*  The United States government does not really recognize that as legitimate.
*  Do we have international law anymore at all?
*  Well we have international law but in the world of realpolitik and geopolitics, the
*  strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must.
*  This is the principle unfortunately that more or less overrides international law norms
*  and rules.
*  Right now in this gray area of let's say of an inter-ministerial international system,
*  so the old international system is crumbling down and the new international system is trying
*  to be born.
*  So we are in this let's say stadium of an emergence of a new global system in which
*  each and single field including the international law, we see it also with international organizations
*  such as the United Nations.
*  The United Nations Security Council is the perfect example for it where we have clear
*  bipolarization, bifurcation of the club between China and Russia on the one hand and United
*  States, France and UK on the other.
*  And the same goes for all these international bodies.
*  And that is to say that they are being of course used on both sides and at the same
*  time they are being misused unfortunately.
*  That is the reality we are right now.
*  We are in this period of international relations where the number of international military
*  conflicts and wars hasn't been that high since the end of the Cold War.
*  So it's the highest number of military conflicts and wars.
*  We have a lot of as you said casualties.
*  We have I argue we are going to have even more tensions and more military conflicts
*  in the next years to come with this year 2024 being extremely volatile.
*  And in a sense I'm not surprised that we are in this situation where both sides are trying
*  to instrumentalize legal norms, rules, standards but to no avail because in the end up until
*  we do not have let's say a new winner or new emerging blocks with their reading of international
*  law, with their understanding of organizational principles, with their structures.
*  We will be in this gray zone of interpretation and misinterpretation and practically there
*  is almost no common ground in between.
*  We do see that there is no more global policeman power that can decide over the end of military
*  conflicts or wars.
*  At the same time we also see that more or less the narratives that are coming from
*  both sides are equally being instrumentalized because on the one hand right now you mentioned
*  the case of the Middle East.
*  In fact I argue that the war between Israel and Hamas probably will find its way by the
*  end of this year as compared to some other tensions that will be still ongoing and like
*  the war for instance in Ukraine which will still be ongoing in the next several years.
*  But here we have a clear case where you see that the West, United States, European Union
*  powers are supporting Israel and countries like China, Russia are actually supporting
*  the Palestinian question and I argue that in the end probably this kind of balancing
*  act will be the positive influence on finding a two-state solution for this conflict with
*  devastating humanitarian consequences for the Palestinian people without a doubt.
*  Let's say that Putin manages to take and then keep something like a third of Ukraine and
*  then there's an uneasy truce.
*  What would Putin do next?
*  Is it Tzoualki Gap?
*  Is it Lithuania?
*  Is it Eastern Estonia?
*  Is it Moldova?
*  Play out the scenario in that case.
*  Okay, so first let's start with the calculus what Putin wants.
*  I would like to give you my assessment as to what's going on there and what's been
*  going on there for quite some time now.
*  Now first and foremost Putin wants the whole of Ukraine, not just one-third of Ukraine
*  or 20 percent.
*  Right now Russia controls around 18 percent.
*  No, they want all of it.
*  If it's necessary, they will just make 10 to 15 years planned how to slowly but surely
*  subjugate the whole of Ukraine.
*  That means in a similar way how it's been proceeded since 2014, you had practically
*  a series of military actions followed by ceasefire, followed by some kind of negotiations, then
*  followed by military actions and rinse and repeat tactics.
*  This was the case for almost 10 years.
*  Due to this kind of strategy, Russia was able to militarily control Eastern Ukraine and
*  then it could seize the opportunity to make a move.
*  Of course, I have to say that in my assessment from December 2021, I was pointing to a scenario
*  in which I was absolutely sure that there will be a war, but I actually even called
*  this war a limited military operation and I thought this was my mistake that the war
*  will start in the east and south of Ukraine.
*  I did not think that Putin will make an all-in move in 2022.
*  This is, I must say, was a mistake on my side because as I said, I was seeing this as a
*  10 to 15 years plan how to slowly subjugate the country.
*  Why did he make an all-in move and he practically launched a full-scale war from five directions?
*  Well, I think it's too early to make all these assessments, but certainly, I would argue
*  the regional environment and situation prior to 2022 and also the global environment.
*  That means think of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, then think of elections in key
*  European countries in 2021.
*  There was a political, let's say, vacuum until new governments were built.
*  We had key elections in Germany.
*  This is, as you know, meanwhile, the key provider of support for Ukraine.
*  We had the worst energy crisis in 2021 already looming in Europe and we had the worst actually
*  indicator for food prices.
*  This is the FAU index that was reaching already levels of 2011 in December.
*  All of these were regional and global environment indicators that probably led also to this
*  decision.
*  More importantly, what Putin got was also this assurance of comprehensive, if you like,
*  full-scale comprehensive support coming from China.
*  He has been building up this modus vivendi with Xi Jinping since 2013 when Xi Jinping
*  came to power.
*  He knew that by launching a full-scale war, and this is my personal assessment, of course,
*  he would not just trigger the systemic competition between the United States and China.
*  China at that time was not ready for that kind of fast-speeded competition, which meanwhile,
*  as we know, has accelerated to the point of the introduction of tariffs and the decoupling
*  has really, really been triggered.
*  But also, in a sense, Putin correctly bet on China that China was, even if not agreeing
*  with the whole decision, would support Moscow in this endeavor as it turned out.
*  Going back now to your question, I just wanted to make this clarification.
*  What would be the next steps?
*  What would be the next on his agenda?
*  Now again, first and foremost, what is on his agenda is that he will not give up on
*  attacking Kiev and attacking Odessa and trying to get as much as possible from Ukraine.
*  If he's not able for whatever reasons, we cannot debate now about the technicalities
*  of the war.
*  Russia has been adapting, but Russia has also made a lot of mistakes.
*  Ukraine has been adapting in the war.
*  In reality, right now, they are attacking the second largest city, Kiev, but obviously,
*  they're also attacking Odessa.
*  Like I said, my expectation is that they will be attacking Kiev again.
*  Let's assume, even if partially successful or fully successful, but let's assume Putin
*  succeeds in getting a large part of Ukraine.
*  Then we have some sort of negotiations, some sort of ceasefire and then negotiations.
*  Like I said, this is the best case scenario from Russia's point of view because every
*  time when there were ceasefire agreements and any kind of negotiations, in this case,
*  This will also legitimize the Russian territorial gains.
*  This ceasefire has always been violated.
*  In a sense, this is actually placed into the cards of Russia.
*  This is the main question.
*  Will Russia actually attack other countries in Europe?
*  Am I understanding correctly your question?
*  So if Putin hates NATO and holds a grudge against NATO, he'll want to take some marginal
*  action that will split the NATO coalition, not so dramatic that everyone is against him.
*  So something like, say, send an army group into eastern Estonia, claim there's ethnic
*  turmoil, side with the Russian minority, tell a bunch of lies, and then work to subvert
*  the Baltics.
*  Is that in the cards to come next or not?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  If I were him or if I were to consult him and he is successful in his actions so far,
*  why would he not try it?
*  First and foremost, the Baltics, I think that they already understand the high risk of such
*  situation.
*  In fact, we have to split it in two parts, the one part being neighboring countries like
*  Moldova and Georgia.
*  And there I would also go for territories because I have already the military presence,
*  I have already, I mean, from Russia's point of view, territories like Transnistria, which
*  is neighboring Odessa and practically will enable a sanitary cordon with the European
*  Union, but also in Georgia with the sweeping borders in South Ossetia, for instance.
*  In Abkhazia, I would just go for these territories because this is about status and about great
*  power exercise.
*  And in the next step, I would actually consider doing something like this, like an attack
*  on the Baltic, because first and foremost, there will be a certain regional environment
*  that will allow it.
*  What do I mean by that?
*  Let's say the members of NATO and the European Union are somehow in conflictual blocks because
*  of the future of these organizations.
*  We do not talk about 2024, obviously, but in the next years, the European Union as a
*  bloc will undergo major shifts and a lot of troubles and the member states will probably
*  not be so coherent in their positions all the time.
*  And the same goes for NATO, especially if we have a very, very different US leadership.
*  So under these circumstances, provocation like this would mean to test the Article 5,
*  let's say to use the opportunity to show that Article 5 of NATO is not really going to be
*  activated.
*  This is a possibility.
*  I would say right now, from today's point of view, it is absolutely possible and to
*  some extent probable, but not plausible.
*  But in the next few years, depending on the success of Russia in Ukraine, and I mean the
*  timeframe of 2025-2026, I would not exclude, as I said, such possible and probable act
*  by Russia, for instance, on the Baltic.
*  Not so much on Poland.
*  I do not take this really seriously as some analysts are pointing an attack on Poland.
*  I would also think that Poland may actually seek to get nuclear weapons.
*  So in the case if Poland decides to go nuclear, this question will be automatically answered
*  as to whether Russia would be eager to attack Poland.
*  Now, I know this is a highly speculative question, but if you had to guess, where would strategic
*  nuclear weapons most likely be used next?
*  What would be your pick?
*  First and foremost, I want to stress that the risk of the use of nuclear weapons has
*  not grown bigger.
*  With all the nuclear blackmail, with all the threats that nuclear weapons will be used
*  coming from Russia, we saw a precedent in the international relations in modern times
*  that a country, obviously a great power, tries to legitimize territorial gains by the threat
*  of the use of nuclear weapons.
*  This risk, the risk of the realistic use of nuclear weapons, has not grown bigger.
*  That is the first thing that I really want to stress, that I still do not see nuclear
*  war taking place.
*  Second point, Russia has a lot of conventional weapons systems that it is obviously already
*  using against Ukraine, and it does not need the tactical nuclear weapon against Ukraine.
*  But it does not have to be Ukraine, and I mean a strategic nuke.
*  So say North Korea, if they are approaching some kind of strange end game, or if American
*  forces are doing badly in the South China Sea and were tempted to take out a fleet of
*  Chinese warships using a nuke.
*  Of all the scenarios you can imagine, which is the one that would surprise you least?
*  Maybe actually the use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia against Ukraine.
*  If you outline all these scenarios, I just do not anticipate the United States using
*  the nuclear weapon.
*  Think of all the military defeats that the United States had experienced over the decades,
*  they still did not use the nuclear weapon, be it Vietnam or Afghanistan or whatever kind
*  of military endeavours they had.
*  I think that North Korea would not go for the nuclear weapon because the moment when
*  they decide this, they will be annihilated not by one but by two critically important
*  players because the whole lifeline for North Korea is coming from China and by extension
*  from Russia.
*  Neither China nor Russia will actually allow small players in the international relations
*  to use the nuclear weapon because there is scalability in the international relations.
*  You are allowed as a smaller player to do some steps to create some havoc in the regional
*  environment if it's in the interest of some of your supporters, as it is the case right
*  now in North Korea.
*  Why is North Korea receiving all this technological transfer and the whole political and diplomatic
*  support from countries like China and Russia?
*  It's obvious because activating the North Korean cart plays into the carts of Beijing
*  and Moscow because North Korea creates tensions in the Indo-Pacific and overstretched the
*  attention of the US leadership.
*  It also complicates the situation with South Korea and South Korea together with Japan
*  are the most important Indo-Pacific allies of the United States.
*  So long as North Korea plays its cart smartly and in its allowed scope of activities, things
*  will be fine but I just don't see why North Korea would be actually eager to use a nuclear
*  weapon.
*  Maybe just because we are at the level of speculation.
*  If we are at the level of speculation, one region that would probably see nuclearization
*  will witness more nuclearization is actually the Middle East because Iran has never been
*  closer to getting the nuclear weapon and given the most recent escalatory path between Israel
*  and Iran, Israel has the nuclear weapon, Iran still doesn't have the nuclear weapon.
*  We may argue that this could be one such scenario.
*  Again I don't consider it to be probable but because you want me to speculate, I will do
*  this with big pleasure just for the sake of intellectual exercise to let's say outline
*  a scenario in which Israel would consider using the nuclear weapon for the sake of not
*  allowing Iran to do so.
*  A question about your work at FACE.
*  So we're recording a day after the Iranian helicopter crash and we don't know what happened.
*  It might have just been a helicopter crash because of bad weather and fog but surely
*  you have clients calling you, messaging you, pinging you, wanting to know what's going
*  on.
*  What is it you do in the course of the day to be able to respond to them coherently?
*  Like what concrete steps do you take to have a message that is more interesting or more
*  informative than what they might see on Twitter?
*  Well first and foremost what I post on Twitter is not what I actually discuss with my clients
*  off the record.
*  That's very important because I have networks, I have 25 years of professional background
*  and I have networks of people who have proven track of analysis and assessment and are very
*  often also on the ground.
*  What I do is to of course get as credible information as possible.
*  My clients usually ask exactly these kind of questions as you do right now.
*  Will there be in the case of the example you gave, will there be an escalation between
*  Israel and Iran?
*  Will there be a political turmoil in Iran following this helicopter crash?
*  Will there be a next military episode between Israel and Iran?
*  What will be the cascading effects beyond the region?
*  Or the question that you asked about the military conflict and the possible military attack
*  on Taiwan.
*  These are questions that come out almost every day.
*  But practically what I post on Twitter is linked to information I read.
*  These are open source analysis and mostly assessments by other colleagues or articles
*  being published and I just read, go through these sources and I post and comment.
*  It's not the same as when you have to give an answer to a client who has certain exposure
*  in a particular region or has an investment portfolio and this investment portfolio is
*  for instance affected by certain military conflicts and so on and so forth.
*  It's a very different way of consulting.
*  Twitter, which is now X, is just for fun.
*  This is my rescue from the day because the whole day I just read and read and read.
*  A lot of sources, a lot of information.
*  I have a lot of chat rooms on various telecommunication platforms.
*  Of course with the time I can easily identify whether the source is credible or not.
*  I use five different languages so it's a very diverse way of getting information.
*  I know for instance when it comes to a certain conflict or a certain region which sources
*  to use and which platforms are credible.
*  That is a very, very different kind of approach.
*  If for instance a common user on Twitter will just check on Twitter and start reading through
*  the sources.
*  Thanks to this kind of long-term experience it's very easy for me to track and understand
*  what is credible, what not.
*  This is only one of several pillars of my activities at FACE.
*  I have private clients within FACE but these are individuals from different backgrounds,
*  professions who are mostly interested in this world of geopolitics and do not have the same
*  amount of time to read and to go through all these sources.
*  They just rely on my assessment for specific topics.
*  I must also highlight that the daily business of politics is not my main field.
*  My main field is actually the long-term 10 to 15 years macro perspective.
*  I actually draw scenarios for the future of international relations and for the future
*  of the relations between great powers, for instance China, United States, Russia, China,
*  or India, China and so on and so forth.
*  For the next 10 to 15 years thanks to trends and risk analysis.
*  This is something that is derived from the daily business of politics but in fact it's
*  a different methodology.
*  This different methodology is not helpful for tactical developments.
*  It is helpful if you for instance consider long-term oriented investment based or derived
*  from this macro analysis.
*  What do I mean?
*  Let me give you one example.
*  If now people are talking about semiconductors and an investment in semiconductors would
*  be a very smart investment.
*  I have invested in semiconductors six, seven years ago knowing that there will be actually
*  a bifurcation of the global system and one of the critical areas of it will be semiconductors.
*  Having the trend projections, the long-term projections in mind helps you to get the big
*  picture in the long run.
*  If you are of course patient and if you really want to play this game, the long game.
*  This is where I'm located mostly, not at the tactical level.
*  Do you find prediction markets or Metaculist useful at all?
*  I do not do any predictions.
*  That is the whole point.
*  They're information sources you could incorporate into say a 10 to 15 year forecast or do you
*  just think they don't contain much extra information?
*  The big difference is that predictions for instance, you have like this big prediction
*  houses when it comes to elections for instance.
*  They try to predict the outcome of elections.
*  Contrary to predictions, I anticipate possible futures.
*  I do foresight, not predictions, not forecast.
*  I cannot forecast anything.
*  What is foresight?
*  Foresight is practically to thanks to the daily observation of events and developments
*  to categorize these events and developments into trends to assess a possible trend projection
*  that will point to a certain direction in which for instance the global system goes.
*  What do I mean by global system?
*  Because I'm really focused on the macro perspective.
*  In my case, the global system, this is my own concept that I've been working with since
*  2014.
*  That is that practically all the relevant socioeconomic networks, you take global finance
*  system, you take global energy system, you take the global finance, trade, economy, agriculture.
*  This most relevant socioeconomic systems that have emerged specifically because of the globalization,
*  the last globalization wave following the collapse of the Soviet Union, introduction
*  most of the countries into a global capitalist system.
*  They are now meanwhile more or less intertwined.
*  Looking at the interactions between these networks and looking at the way how these
*  systems are undergoing transformation gives me some answers as to in which direction it
*  goes.
*  Let me give you an example.
*  Most of the analysts you would agree have been pointing at least for the last 20 years
*  towards multipolarity.
*  The biggest cliche that we've been hearing is that we are sliding into a multipolarity
*  order.
*  We have several big centers of power, several great powers and so on and so forth.
*  I've never bought into this.
*  Since 2014, when I started looking at this macro perspective based on this global system
*  concept I've developed, I saw that practically we have only two centers of power and everything
*  in between is in this gray zone that is oscillating between United States on the one hand and
*  China on the other.
*  Russia I argue has taken sides already in 2014.
*  In fact, Russia has been saved by China following the first intervention in Ukraine and following
*  the first launch of Western sanctions when Russia was facing a serious almost precarious
*  economic situation was saved by China.
*  Now meanwhile most of these middle powers are still avoiding taking sides.
*  They want to capitalize from both worlds.
*  Classic example right now is the case of India.
*  India is acting as a bridge, as a geopolitical bridge between the two antagonists trying
*  to take the best of both worlds.
*  It is very, very difficult to bring this long term picture that is to play out in the next
*  five or ten or 15 years to the daily business of politics.
*  Why?
*  Because people are just not following.
*  They just don't have the time to follow all these trends and they don't have the time
*  to go into all these specific systemic processes.
*  When I was talking about bipolarity in 2015 or when I was talking about the dragon bear
*  since 2014, the dragon bear being this modus vivendi of China and Russia, as modus operandi
*  to coordinate without the necessity to enter any strategic alliance.
*  People were not interested because it did not really affect the daily life of politics.
*  But now you would agree that China, Russia, Axis or whatever kind of articles are almost
*  coming out on a daily base.
*  We are already talking about decoupling and we are already discussing this kind of bipolarity.
*  This is the point.
*  I have a ten years of time span that I have been investing every day into trying to get
*  the trend projections correctly, but it is absolutely not possible to convince anybody
*  else of the correctness of this assessment so long as the reality doesn't kick in and
*  proves you right.
*  This is what was happening at least with most of my assessments.
*  This is how I am right now not stuck in 2024.
*  I am already in 2030, 2040 and so on and so forth.
*  Most of my assessment is actually helping clients to prepare for the long term perspective.
*  I am not a consultancy like most of these consultancies providing these daily briefs
*  and analysis telling you about the dynamics in a specific country, explaining you the
*  constellations between the political actors and whatsoever, which is equally important.
*  I am not denying the importance on the opposite.
*  It's just that what I do is so rare.
*  Right now, I am observing a lot of consultancies like the big consultancies, Goldman Sachs
*  and so on and so forth are trying to enter this business of foresight, geopolitical foresight
*  with big teams and trying to foresee the future.
*  In the end, I would argue it's a methodology that is not so easily to be conducted.
*  Especially, it's not easy to be conducted because you have to free yourself from any
*  kind of biases, personal biases and you have to have a model.
*  We may argue some have developed indexes like the two political risk index that is now being
*  published by the Federal Reserve.
*  They try to track back different headlines in various newspapers and magazines and then
*  based on the number empirically, they just point to the severity of geopolitical risk
*  like it happened with the Russia's war against Ukraine.
*  We have different kind of metrics, algorithmic and empirical one.
*  My approach is very qualitative one and it's really based and derived from what I just
*  explained to you.
*  Felina Chakorova, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
