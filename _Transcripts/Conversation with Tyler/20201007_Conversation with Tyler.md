Video Description: Audrey Tang began reading classical works like the Shūjīng and Tao Te Ching at the age of 5 and learned the programming language Perl at the age of 12. Now, the autodidact and self-described “conservative anarchist” is a software engineer and the first non-binary digital minister of Taiwan. Their work focuses on how social and digital technologies can foster empathy, democracy, and human progress.

Audrey joined Tyler to discuss how Taiwan approached regulating Chinese tech companies, the inherent extraterritoriality of data norms, how Finnegans Wake has influenced their approach to technology, the benefits of radical transparency in communication, why they appreciate the laziness of Perl, using “humor over rumor” to combat online disinformation, why Taiwan views democracy as a set of social technologies, how their politics have been influenced by Taiwan’s indigenous communities and their oral culture, what Chinese literature teaches about change, how they view Confucianism as a Daoist, how they would improve Taiwanese education, why they view mistakes in the American experiment as inevitable — but not insurmountable, the role of civic tech in Taiwan’s pandemic response, the most important remnants of Japanese influence remaining in Taiwan, why they love Magic: The Gathering, the transculturalism that makes Taiwan particularly open and accepting of LGBT lifestyles, growing up with parents who were journalists, how being transgender makes them more empathetic, the ways American values still underpin the internet, what they learned from previous Occupy movements, why translation, rotation, and scaling are important skills for becoming a better thinker, and more.

# Audrey Tang on the Technology of Democracy  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [October 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDtWabMapvg)
*  Hello everyone, welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Tonight I'm chatting with the amazing Audrey Tang, who is also digital minister of Taiwan.
*  Audrey, welcome.
*  Hello, good local time everyone.
*  What software that doesn't exist yet would be most helpful for coordinating future anti-authoritarian
*  movements?
*  Well, of course, a quantum resistant cryptographic channel will really help that enable true secure
*  conversation that once someone tries to intercept it, you will know immediately.
*  There are encrypted channels now, such as WhatsApp. Do they not serve that function?
*  If the makers of the software decide to eavesdrop themselves, then there's no physical property,
*  only mathematical property that stops the conversation being eavesdropped.
*  Now those what we call the public key cryptography, mathematics, is at this very real
*  danger of being broken within a decade or so, or two decades if you're optimistic by the quantum
*  computer themselves.
*  What kind of software do we need to make the democracy of the future work?
*  Well, first of all, I think democracy is an ongoing process. So definitely something that makes the
*  listening at scale work, that makes co-presence work, that enables people who are closest to the
*  suffering, amplify their experiences, and so that people with various different backgrounds can
*  empathize with that experience. So in short, software that enables listening and feeling at scale.
*  And does virtual reality help in that regard, or does virtual reality give us experiences so
*  intense that we become less empathetic to suffering because that VR vacation in Paris
*  is just so amazing?
*  That's right. So only if it's shared reality though. I hear you talking about your amazing
*  VR Paris vacation, but unless I can answer the same space and make it an extended reality that
*  contains both of us, it would not become a social reality and just an individual reality.
*  And that may, of course, have some therapeutic effects or overview effect. I'm not denying that,
*  but I would say that this is pro-social but not necessarily democratic.
*  Do you think at the margin people with virtual reality will be more interested in visiting the
*  slums of Mumbai or going to Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan, which is very beautiful, of course?
*  Well, why not do both? I mean, you can definitely take the Sun and Moon Lake and just in the Sun
*  and Moon Lake, have a conversation and watch together how it works in Mumbai and vice versa.
*  I mean, we just had an Asia-Pacific Social Innovation Partnership award, and in the
*  summit, we hear the designers in Singapore working for an app that enables the foreign workers,
*  the offshore workers from the Philippines in, say, Taiwan, to take care of their loved ones.
*  Instead of sending cash home, they can do grocery shopping to make sure that their money is not
*  spent on luxury goods and so on. So that's like three different countries and cultures right there.
*  Let's say we had a service, a better version of AI, and anyone in the world could ask it any
*  question in any language. It would mostly give pretty good answers. Would that increase empathy
*  or lower it? Well, of course, that depends on what you mean by pretty good. Does it make
*  satisfying sounding answers? Does it make answers that seems real? Does it make mostly factual but
*  not empathetic answers? Does it make mostly empathetic but factually untrue answers? What
*  does good enough mean to you? Say it's mostly factual answers. It's as good as a computer chess
*  program. Not perfect, but quite good relative to human knowledge. And anyone can ask anything,
*  like a supercharged Google Plus, a better functioning Siri with real answers. What do
*  we do with that knowledge? Well, first of all, that's the value alignment part. What you're
*  saying is that it more or less agree with the epistemic norms. That is to say the norm around
*  knowledge that a society has. The other part to ask is about the accountability, like when it makes
*  mistakes, who get to correct those mistakes? When it's biased, who get to participate in overcoming
*  the bias? Is the source code, is the API, is the data that he uses participatory or it is known to
*  only a few? What's the innovation that would do the most to boost empathy? Definitely open innovation.
*  That is to say innovation that is co-created to bring technology to people rather than asking
*  people to adapt to technology. Do you think the United States today has more empathy than 20 years
*  ago? I'm not sure that the States is a useful abstraction when you talk about empathy. Empathy
*  are between human beings or at least animals. Do we have more empathy toward animals than 100 years
*  ago? There's much more factory farming, right? There's much more factory farming. That's exactly
*  right. On the other hand, of course, people understand how animals suffer more. That leads
*  to more people understanding the animal welfare and animal rights angles. It also leads to
*  innovations such as the Impossible Burger, the future of meat and things like that. Maybe people
*  eat it only because it actually tastes better and is free of the possible industrial farming
*  side effects, specifically on carbon emissions. Whatever reason you approach those new kinds of
*  meat, I think they are superior in almost every regard than cost. In that part, the science are
*  working on it too. What's your view of that old, I think, Stalin quotation that one death is a tragedy,
*  a million deaths are a statistic. Could it be that the evolution of open source technology
*  that directs our attention toward the whole and the telling of a single story becomes somewhat
*  diminished and therefore we're less empathetic? Well, of course, between one and one million,
*  there are many, many zooming levels. I mean, if you look at an open street map, you can only zoom
*  to the globe or zoom to an individual block in a city or even just to an individual level, then that
*  map is not very useful at all. What's useful is in the transitional zoom levels that makes sure
*  that people can build a context in their head and connect their experiences with people who are
*  slightly different but not at all that different and that builds common values so that a transition
*  between the zooming levels is much more important than the one and the million level. Would it be
*  better if smartphones did not have touch screens? I use of course stylus like all the time and so
*  the touch screens are useful when I don't have the stylus and keyboard hunts as a kind of fallback
*  but if the touch screen is the primary interaction button then of course it builds addiction.
*  But say we could magically revert to the days of Blackberry and somehow that would stick.
*  Would society be better off, do you think? I'm sure that people would still invent a touch screen.
*  But say we could avoid the touch screen, right, and we just stop at Blackberry.
*  Do we use social media in better ways? Why do we jump to Neuralink directly from the Blackberry?
*  It would take several decades at least, right, so we have 30-40 years of Blackberry and people
*  are on social media less. Is that a better outcome? Do we have better discourse, more empathy?
*  Well that may be the case because in Taiwan the most popular Reddit equivalent is the PTT
*  and it's still terminal based. It's like a late 90s version of the bulletin board system
*  and we do see that it leads to better discourse qualities.
*  How bullish are you on work from a distance? This is pandemic time, there's a lot of data.
*  What do you think? Well working from a distance does not mean that you don't meet people face
*  to face. It only means that we transcend space boundaries when we're talking to each other
*  and so if it is something that you can opt in to then of course there are places and ways of work
*  that improve the work quality and I'm quite bullish on that but if it is the must and you have to
*  work from a distance even for the kind of work that doesn't quite suit this working from distance
*  then of course it's going to hurt the quality of work. But take the major tech companies,
*  Apple where you've worked, Facebook, Google. So seven years from now when the pandemic is
*  clearly over, say in the United States, how much of the current work from distance practices
*  will persist or do you think it would all just have gone back to how it was in 2019?
*  I've never been to Cupertino so all my work with Apple for six years were telework so I'm biased.
*  I think it's pretty smooth and if we don't like the tools that we're using for telework
*  we just make the tools better and that's the main idea about open innovation in that if people
*  don't like the particular way that a tool is limiting our imaginations they can always improve
*  on it. So yeah I think again this is not about excluding people from participating in the work
*  it's about expanding the idea of face-to-face meetings and the kind of empathy and rough
*  consensus that we can form and scale it to the more remote places. It's not a replacement,
*  it is an augmentation to the face-to-face form. How should the United States handle the regulation
*  of major Chinese tech companies, the service TikTok or say the service of WeChat? Should we
*  allow major Chinese tech companies to own them? Well take a systemic risk system approach, do
*  what the Taiwanese people did in 2014 which is people on the street deliberated with their own
*  experience working with people who are from the PRC coming to a consensus on the street that there's
*  no pure private sector companies in the PRC and the party or the state really the same thing can
*  just replace and swap leadership as they like through the party branches so we decided eventually
*  that making the infrastructure components in the PRC while their state subsidy looks quite lucrative
*  amortize is actually a higher overall cost of ownership because you have to reassess for each
*  upgrade whether the state have already taken over that so-called private venture. So the U.S.
*  government should block TikTok or make sure it's sold to Oracle or Microsoft or what concretely
*  would that mean? I'm saying that all of society deliberation the style of the 2014 sunflower
*  need to happen for the society had come to a common value about these sort of things and this
*  is what we call data norm. Do you think it is normal for facial recognitions and such data that
*  you are just you know filming yourself as Yin and Zha to be aggregated to a single state and of which
*  there is no jurisdictional accountability of using such data? If you think it's great as a country
*  more powers but if you think it's not great as a country then maybe you collectively can find
*  something to do. Given your position on democracy are you concerned about the de facto extra
*  territoriality of European privacy regulation that web services marketing to the EU have to meet GDPR
*  say so there's not an actual democratic deliberation but it's handed down by the European Union.
*  Right, theoretically it's even extraterrestrial right so if there's European astronauts and so
*  on they're still regulated by the GDPR. So I think there's two things going on here. One is about
*  the data norm and for the EU citizens it extends by the framework of human right and therefore
*  of course travels with the individual not within the territorial jurisdiction and the other view
*  of course is based on the infrastructure where the data is collected where the data used under
*  name of data localization and even sovereignty. We have heard that word too when used on data
*  borders and so just like the example I mentioned of the Singaporean app with Filipino workers
*  in Taiwan buying grocery for their families it's by its very nature three different overlapping
*  jurisdictions and all have a governing interest in it and so it's a reality and GDPR is part of
*  that reality. Why is Finnegans Wake your favorite book? Well because it's very complex and complicated
*  and I can enjoy it without understanding it just treating it as lyrics like a notebook literally
*  a book of notes. Has it influenced your approach to tech at all? Yeah I think so because when I was
*  20 years old I would wake up log into the Pearl IRC channel that's internet relay chat and type
*  river run and then a bot will just paste a random paragraph literally a random paragraph from
*  Finnegans Wake which would begin my day's work and so that's social too everybody in the chat
*  channel sees it and so I'm sure that it has influenced our work on Pearl which is full with
*  haiku and poetry and things like that. Have you written poems in Pearl? Oh yeah of course.
*  Are they good? I don't know you can check the pugs.hs repository to see them. Now your ideal
*  of radical transparency and communications do you think this is appropriate for all organizations
*  and personality types or just something that's good for you? What's your personality type at all?
*  People who are very balanced and moderate I think can do better with radical transparency. People who
*  say might have very high levels of testosterone if they see and hear everything being said about
*  them that they might go into a rage or overreact right? Well going into a rage may also be
*  cathartic. It might be but rages can be dangerous right? Countries going into a rage people going
*  into a rage. I don't know because outrage is the beginning of social movement. The thing is where
*  do you direct the outrage to? If it's directed to revenge that is to say hurting imaginary or real
*  people or if it's directed to I don't know discrimination which is lowering other people's
*  social status without elevating one's own of course those could be destructive as you said
*  but it could also be directed into co-creation that is to say make new institutions so that the
*  old problems that provoke the rage in the first place do not happen again and that's how democracy
*  grows and so I'm all for outrage actually. What do you think of creative ambiguity of a way of
*  postponing disputes? So the European Union often does this. They write a complicated document that
*  means something a bit different to each country. They don't agree. They don't have to agree. It's
*  never radically transparent but they revisit it seven or eight years later and do another tweak
*  and just keep on moving down that road. Does that offend your sense of radical transparency?
*  Well these two are certainly orthogonal. I mean I can imagine being radically transparent but
*  deliberately moving in a very slow fashion and only act on the lowest of the lower hanging fruits.
*  I can see merits in that too. I can also see of course this slow moving parts being non-radically
*  transparent and then the main repercussion would probably be that people cease to feel that it's
*  relevant to their lives and will not devote their energy to it. Given your own radical transparency,
*  do you think people speak to you differently always being aware that it's being recorded or
*  transcribed or do you think they just forget about it and become their normal selves?
*  I think the better parts of themselves are shown much more visibly. That is to say if they have an
*  agenda that benefits humankind or the planet or the cosmos, they're much more likely to share it
*  because it's also performative. They understand that people from the future will see it but the
*  parts of themselves they're thinking for the next quarter only of linear individual growth or GDP
*  growth at a cost or expense of future generations. That part doesn't seem to show.
*  Larry Wall once said that Pearl is designed around laziness, hubris and impatience.
*  Which of those qualities do you think most appeal to you?
*  Laziness.
*  Why? You don't seem lazy. You've done a tremendous amount.
*  Well first of all I've done a tremendous amount precisely because I designed the spaces
*  for the people who care about things to make things happen. Certainly not me personally that
*  have done those things. I just hold the space. The second is that laziness also means that you do not
*  over scare yourself. You evaluate. This is called lazy evaluation. Evaluate the parameters,
*  the input and so on as the situation calls it. That also enables a much more balanced work-life
*  balance I guess. What is the way the world could use the incentive of fun,
*  more productively? So use humor over rumor. What does that mean specifically?
*  In Taiwan whenever there's a trending on even end-to-end encrypted channels disinformation
*  campaign the people who voluntarily report that just like flagging email as spam dedicated not
*  to the government certainly but to the social sector with the crowdsource fact-checking mechanism
*  called COV-CHFACTS and also the Taiwan fact-check center, Maigo Pen and so on part of the
*  international fact-checking network. The trending rumors are met with fact-checkers almost
*  immediately and our ministries who have teams of participation officers who talk to hashtags
*  like the minister of health and welfare, participation officer literally lives with this
*  dog and so can meet the rumors within a couple hours and roll out very funny dog memes that just
*  respond to disinformation. So for example this one is about a mask and this says why do you wear a
*  mask? Well to protect yourself from your own and wash hands. That's a very individualistic incentive.
*  Or why do you observe social distancing when you find it hard to measure? We measure it in terms of
*  dogs when you're outdoor, two dogs away, indoor, three sheep are eating, so on and so on. The idea
*  is that before people go to sleep even if they see both the conspiracy theory they also see
*  humor because it travels very quickly, go viral and so by the time that they go to sleep and form
*  long-term associations in their minds with the keywords such as social distancing they think of
*  something fun and that enable more pro-social behavior. Arguably contemporary Taiwanese culture
*  is really quite gentle in a nice way but say you were in one of the less liberal parts of eastern
*  Europe or the Balkans and the slogan was humor over rumor. Do you think it would work as well as
*  it has in Taiwan? Well we know that humor is not the same as sarcasm for example or as
*  you know toxic attacks that makes fun of someone right? Humor is makes fun of oneself or makes fun
*  with someone but it's never a kind of aggression so when I say humor I mean specifically humor
*  and not any kind of comedic style. Of course there are comedic styles that doesn't work
*  and that will very quickly actually reinforce conspiracy theory thinking. How much of humor
*  do you think is at someone else's expense? So say you watch Seinfeld they're quite brutal to each
*  other right even though they're friends. I don't think there's humor by the way. What is it? Well
*  it is of course comedic right? It makes fun of people but to me humor is makes fun with someone
*  or makes fun of oneself. What is the future of blockchain in Taiwan? Well it would just keep
*  growing I guess. But used for what purposes? What's the killer app for blockchain 10 years from now?
*  What will I be doing with it? What's the killer app for relational database again?
*  Well there are many kinds of relational databases. It's not clear that blockchain
*  is the one emerging from markets as the preferred solution. Visa has databases right? Those work
*  well. It's a huge company. What's the competitor from blockchain? That's exactly right. So blockchain
*  is just one implementation of a broad swath of technology known as distributed ledgers or DLTs
*  and relational databases again could be distributed and if people want easy accountability or
*  auditability they can use some of the technologies originated from blockchain. In that sense Git is
*  a blockchain because it's a chain of blocks and of course Git is the killer app of open source
*  decentralized working. And so I mean if you think only of the cryptocurrency applications I don't
*  think that it will overtake central bank anytime soon in Taiwan. I think it only is a value in the
*  cryptocurrency sense if the people have very low trust in the fiat right in the central bank.
*  But if you mean it's like a ledger technology that keep people accountable and honest across
*  jurisdictions among multiple writers for things like environmental science and things like smart
*  contracts for labor like for migrant workers as I mentioned on the very beginning. Those can see
*  useful work of distributed ledger technologies and blockchain is just one implementation detail.
*  How do you think it mattered for Taiwan that democracy and information technology came to
*  the country at more or less the same time? Well of course that means that we see democracy as
*  set of technologies social technologies. So to us technologies are not always industrial. It could
*  also be social. The set of constitutional amendments of which another one or a few is going
*  on right now shows that even the constitution the kernel of democracy is technology that people can
*  contribute to just like sending pull requests to the Linux kernel. How did Taiwan become such a nice
*  country so quickly? Well maybe the food is good and bubble tea helps too. What's the best food in
*  Taiwan and where do you find it? Well I think the rough consensus is that you can consult the michelin
*  guide which operates in Taiwan in a lot of municipalities but of course being a oyster
*  vegetarian the majority of which is I don't really pursue so you have to be your own guide.
*  How do you think your politics have been influenced by Taiwan's aboriginal communities?
*  Yeah the indigenous communities that I'm more familiar with is the Atayal and Amis. The former
*  because I spent quite a few months actually if not here right after dropping out of the middle
*  school because my mom was co-founding an experimental primary school in the Atayal mountains
*  in collaboration with the indigenous people there. So actually the students there also
*  learns the indigenous perspective and I really feel liberated from a written culture that just
*  orally preserved culture really takes me out of this human-centric point of view in the view that
*  the mountains and rivers are long-lived spirits and we're just transient stewards that works with
*  them. I think that really have influenced my politics a lot to be less human-centric. The Amis
*  because I think they're a matriarchy and so quite useful to remind people that in Taiwan
*  was more than 20 national languages there's various different gender stereotypes going on and once you
*  have 20 different kind of stereotypes it becomes a rainbow and it helps people to break out of the
*  binary kind of thinking when it comes to gender but also to other categories. How useful a way
*  is it of conceptualizing your politics to think of it as a mix of some Taiwanese Aboriginal
*  traditions mixed in with Taoism, experience and programming and then your own theory of humor and
*  fun and if you put all of that together the result is Audrey Tang's politics correct or not?
*  Well as of now of course but of course I'm also growing like a distributed legend.
*  At the margin what's the new influence on your thought in addition to those sources?
*  I just read again the Mandarin translation of Teh-Chang's novel collection Exhalation. I already
*  read the English one but the translation book just arrived so I read that again and so that's on the
*  margins. I learned about the life cycle of software projects and so on. I think that one is really good.
*  What else from Chinese literature has influenced you?
*  Of course there's not only the Daodejing, there's this whole literary tradition that began with
*  Laozi but Zhuangzi of course is of a lot of influence to me. The collection of poems,
*  the Shi Jing also and of course also the Yi Jing, the original binary thinking but of course
*  the thing about the Book of Change is that it teaches about the only thing that is immobile
*  that would not change is change itself and how to work with the change to face, to accept,
*  to deal with it and let go of it. I think it's the core of the teaching of the Yi Jing.
*  And how about contemporary Chinese fiction or is that somehow too anti-empathetic?
*  I don't know. I enjoy the Three-Body Problem trilogy. That's contemporary Chinese fiction,
*  isn't it? From Taiwanese culture, what has influenced you most? So Taiwanese cinema from
*  the 1990s, does that matter for you or that's orthogonal? Well of course I watch the artworks
*  done by the Taiwanese Renaissance filmmakers and books and so on but I wouldn't say that any of
*  them influenced me to such a high degree as the classics has so I'll probably have to say that
*  of course I'm influenced one way or another but not in a major part of my thought. And which
*  Western anarchists if any have shaped your thought? Well that's a really good question, isn't it?
*  Well I don't know. I mean I've read of course the anarchists FAQ, the anarchists
*  like Handbook online, right? And also the Illuminatus trilogy which may or may not count
*  as anarchist. That of course has really left an impression to me but no I think the main
*  source of inspiration I draw and that's why I call myself a conservative anarchist is from the
*  more Eastern traditions, the Taoist tradition, the Zhuangzi tradition and more recently from
*  Ko Jin, a Japanese anarchist thinker. To what extent do you understand Taoism as standing in
*  opposition to a more hierarchical Confucian view or do you think it's simply a separate doctrine?
*  By being a Taoist, do you view yourself as opposed to Confucianism?
*  Well the Taoist isn't quite opposed to anything. That's the thing with Taoist, right? We're always
*  making space so that opposition can grow into common values and innovation and I think that's
*  something that the Confucian approach works too except for the Confucianism that is by coding
*  essentially the rights, the norms, the best practices of norms and for a Taoist
*  of course there's no best practice, there's just practices and the best best practice is maybe just
*  to share and let go of your practices and be humble. How do you think Singapore differs in
*  this regard? Is there a different understanding of Taoism there? More emphasis on Confucianism?
*  I haven't been to Singapore, can't answer that. Never? I'm surprised.
*  Wow. What would improve Taiwanese education the most?
*  That's an interesting thought, right? Well maybe Neuralink but I don't know.
*  In the meantime? Well I think that the shift from a literacy-based
*  like standardized answer, rote memory standardized test, the teachers knows the best,
*  into a competence-based education which is the people are producers of data and media and
*  narratives that really helps. On the other hand I'm biased because I'm part of the K-12
*  Curation Committee that put this into action starting last year. Do you have any sense how
*  that's going? I know it's only a year but what are you seeing? It's going quite well. The cram
*  schools for example instead of putting people into like long hours trying to memorize standardized
*  answers are now offering cram schools on hiking and maybe kayaking and all sort of outdoor
*  group activities and also help on the humanitarian aid overseas. Even though travel is restricted
*  now we can still help through teleconference and so on. There's a lot more emphasis on social
*  responsibility starting from a more tender age rather than just individualistic competition
*  between people and people. You're working of course in Taiwanese government. What's the biggest thing
*  wrong with economists? You mean the magazine? No, no, the people, economists as thinkers. What's
*  their biggest defect or flaw? I don't know. I haven't met an economist that I didn't like
*  so I don't think there's any particular personality flaws there. A few questions about the pandemic.
*  How much of Taiwan's success do you think was due to government's openness and how much do you think
*  was due to the fact that in Taiwan standards for privacy are different than in the west
*  and there's a certain acceptance of government? A higher I'm sure yes and more clearly spelled out.
*  First of all I think having a clearly spelled out perimeter in Taiwan when it comes to privacy
*  and a strong civil rights movement that literally fought for those freedoms and
*  memories are still fresh really helps the conversation because anything that tries to
*  encroach on the basic freedoms is immediately met with the counter argument. Do you want to go back
*  to the martial law? Do you want to go back to the white terror? And of course the argument would be
*  very strong and so the people who advocate for less privacy would that argument with their
*  argument would be a non-starter and so I think it really helps to conserve the societal energy
*  to work with the data that's already being collected. Just use it in a way creatively to
*  counter the pandemic instead of inventing new ways to collect data which always has uncertain
*  privacy properties so I think of course that helps. Now my country the United States has made
*  many many mistakes at an almost metaphysical level. What is it in the United States that those
*  mistakes have come from? What's our deeper failing behind all those mistakes? I don't know. I mean
*  isn't America this grand experiment to keep making mistakes and correcting them in the open
*  and share it with the world? That's the American experiment. Have we started correcting them yet?
*  I'm sure that you have. Okay I'm delighted to hear that.
*  How much did Taiwan rely on privately written apps to combat the pandemic?
*  Actually CivicTech which is I guess could also qualify as privately coded is different in the
*  sense that how it works is open for anyone who want to fork that is to say to take it to a
*  different direction. So while it's true that the original mask availability map wasn't open source
*  the API was open and open source clones and derivatives from the OpenStreetMap community
*  from various other community very quickly sprouted and we have more than 140 a majority of which are
*  open innovations and even the original mask availability map become open source after a
*  couple months. So if you keep working in the open working out loud even the most privately held
*  corporations such as Google eventually agreed to make the parts of the counter pandemic the
*  mass availability and so on and develop them in the open. Given Taiwan's remarkable success with
*  the pandemic, its amazing success with high quality semiconductor chips, why are there in
*  relative terms so few successful Taiwanese software companies and to what features of
*  the Taiwanese psyche do you attribute that? I don't know TSMC writes a lot of software.
*  So I think it's just consumer software like to see software it's true I mean
*  Taiwan has a unicorn now although I don't usually use that word company Appia that basically is
*  entirely to be they enable businesses to deliver insights from the interactions and refactor the
*  online experiences and so on but I'm sure that Pizza Hut or any company that deploy APR technology
*  would not probably feature a powered by Appia kind of way as the power by Intel or
*  powered by ARM kind of marker in their websites and so there are very successful Taiwanese
*  software companies they are known in the software world Trend Micro is another one but because these
*  are less directly to users to customers and so maybe they are less well known that that's a
*  fact and so the Taiwanese psyche I think is mostly about being okay with that I guess the hashtag
*  Taiwan can help Taiwan is helping really says it on the tin that we don't quite do this egoism you
*  don't have to thank Taiwan every 20 seconds if our innovations have helped you we really just want
*  the world to be better do you ever worry that Taiwan has had so much success against COVID-19
*  that now the country is painted into a kind of corner unwilling to give up its grand prize
*  and it just won't be able to open to other places for a long time or do you think that sure that
*  once the vaccine once the vaccine is here around the turn of the year I'm sure that by Q1 next
*  year when people are vaccinated it will open that is what the scientists are saying if you're
*  recommending for a visitor an ideal trip to Taiwan obviously they fly into Taipei there's
*  plenty to do and see in Taipei National Museum but where else should they go for you well the
*  Pescador the Punghu Islands is great too I mean Taiwan is beautiful islands and it's plural so
*  it's not only the mainland of Taiwan but also the Pescador Islands the Orchid Islands there's many
*  other islands other than the mainland of Taiwan for you to enjoy what's your favorite Chinese
*  dynasty and why um I don't know I don't have a favorite Chinese dynasty do you have a favorite
*  GPS location uh my home but the Tang dynasty I thought would be your answer there's the
*  I don't know I haven't right Xi'an is the capital I haven't lived in the Tang dynasty I read about
*  the Tang dynasty and although my family name I guess is the same character as the Tang dynasty
*  it never really brought me closer to any particular dynasties as a Taiwanese how do you think you
*  understand earlier Chinese history in maybe a different way than Chinese mainlanders would
*  well I don't know I mean I identify mostly as homo sapiens uh and so I don't I mean we're all
*  descendants of some East African common ancestor and so when you say your home I immediately think
*  of Lucy which was strictly speaking isn't homo sapiens but the GPS location would be quite similar
*  so yeah that's the view that I take that of course on the land of the Eurasian plate there's many
*  cultures and civilizations whether you call it Chinese or not is quite besides the point
*  the main interest for me is how those cultures transfer and learn from each other and make cultural
*  innovations such as Zen which is a trans cultural conversation between the Buddhist tradition and
*  the Taoist tradition and and that interests me more than whether you call a particular dynasty
*  Chinese or not I mean for the Qing dynasty and the Yuan dynasty that's a very interesting
*  way to call it a dynasty I believe no Chinese person from the mainland would have given me
*  that answer another historical question when you read about the Taiping rebellion for whom are you
*  rooting the rebels or the government uh-huh well um yeah the Taiping rebellion the the Jesus
*  worshiping uh revolution there's a millenarian sense to it that's a bit like some of tech
*  utopianism right that's the world's become an open place was a document uh I think it was
*  typing yel shu or something that has a lot of tech utopianism in it but I don't think it's ever put
*  into practice so if you view it from a kind of admiring a science fiction novel kind of way
*  I think you can definitely root for it but I don't think the Taiping Tengu actually deployed
*  what's described in the Taiping yel shu to any significant degree
*  which are the most important remnants of Japanese influence remaining in Taiwan
*  well um the emphasis on public health the fact that people see that working in the
*  medical and public health professions as the high and noble cause of calling I think that
*  was introduced by the Japanese colonial rule and it's well of course there's a political part of
*  it because the Japanese really didn't like Taiwanese going into politics or law for that
*  matter and but yeah the emphasis on public health and on medicine and medicare I think that really
*  is one of the legacies the organization of streets and shops in Taiwan especially Taipei feels quite
*  Japanese to me do you have the same impression there are parts of Taipei that feels quite
*  Japanese of course the the cabinet office the executive Yuan and the presidential office were
*  both buildings of that era of course they were also learning from European architects so it's
*  also very trans cultural in both Japan and Taiwan baseball is fairly popular as it is in the United
*  States but most countries reject baseball altogether do you have a sense of why Taiwanese
*  have welcomed baseball is it just historical accident or revealing of something deeper
*  I haven't considered that question maybe because when I was you know I couldn't participate in any
*  kind of sport baseball included and so I've never thought too much about sports e-sport of course
*  I've thought about quite a bit but of course we're not here to talk about match the gathering which
*  I can talk for hours what's the most popular e-sport in Taiwan um well that's a really good
*  question um I think by the current definition of e-sport it will probably be be Weichi the goal
*  which is a intellectual game that's played on stones and large boards and of which AlphaGo of
*  course showed that machines can play too but it's still very popular in Taiwan as with
*  Gomoku are also known as Renju and Xiangxi the elephant chess I don't know how to translate
*  that actually so various board games and these are Shogi right yeah yeah that's right well Shogi is a
*  slightly different role and play in Japan but yeah board games that are turn-based and moved
*  of course nowadays all into the electronic realm remain the of the lowest threshold to join and
*  therefore very popular and what's your favorite e-sport um as I mentioned magic the gathering but
*  I don't play it much anymore I used to play a lot because of addiction so it's like the touch
*  screen smartphone no because of I was making the software that enabled people to play magic the
*  gathering without paying wizard of the coast it was a real software project that I was working on
*  the magic suitcase and also working with the apprentice with the drafting
*  mechanism so that people don't have to be locked in to wizard of the coast and so on so to me it's
*  also feels liberating I guess so that people even with no money and who are living very modest means
*  and so on can enjoy the game and essentially creating their own rules why is it you think
*  that Taiwan has been so much more open and accepting of LGBTQ than most or maybe all other
*  parts of Asia well first of all I think that's because as I mentioned there is more than one
*  norm going on right even in the ethnic one there is the Taiwanese holo Taiwanese Hakka
*  and many traditions some of which is actually quite natural to have I think
*  I don't know how to translate that term like a contractual union brother whatever that means
*  and in the Taiwanese holo tradition and there's also the indigenous nations and with for example
*  the Paiwan nation that doesn't quite make a distinction between genders when electing their
*  leaders of the indigenous nation and so on and so because of the trans-culturalism in Taiwan
*  and open and democratic culture we eventually see that even though there is a part of the country
*  maybe the majority at some point that sees marriage as between families and the individual that wed
*  are just representatives of their families eventually other more individual to individual
*  norms prevail and in 2008 become the only form of recognized marriage which is via registration
*  and that in addition to the feminist movement that fought for the equal rights for women to
*  not having to you know relinquish her family name when they marry and things like that
*  all led to the feeling of intersectionality so that the earliest feminist activists would then
*  be the most ardent allies to the LGBTIQ plus community so I think early successes and also
*  the way to work themselves into the gender equality committee and 12 years of gender
*  mainstreaming work the gender impact assessment in the public sector and so on all of these
*  mechanism designs help to make a more liberal culture out of the existing culture a family to
*  family relationship which we did not actually disrupt with the marriage equality law it only
*  hyperlinks to the individual parts the bylaws but not the in-law relationships the family between
*  family relationships for our final segment of this conversation I'll turn to what I call the
*  Audrey Chang production function at ages five to six you read a lot of classical literature
*  what did you read and how did it shape you yeah I read the Shijing the collection of poems
*  and it shaped me to view things always from coaches from various different coaches because
*  each chapter in the Shijing is literally one slice of culture of a very different culture and it's a
*  kind of collection of poems that shows how the same thing may be interpreted and narrated in
*  completely different ways from two different cultures when they view the same historical event
*  and of course the Daodejing that showed me that we are merely spaces of which that thoughts may
*  pass through us but we don't own the thoughts the thoughts on us briefly how did having a
*  heart problem until age 12 shape your life well I guess it made me less interested in outdoor sports
*  it also made me less prone to anger or really any passion right I can't feel very joyful either
*  because of the heart condition so I'm more calm and collected I learned Daoist breathing exercises
*  and they're with me like a survival instinct still now do you think there's any cognitive
*  disadvantage to being more objective and arguably more detached I'm not sure that I'm currently
*  detached to you and I'm not sure that I'm sharing things from objective point of view I mean I'm
*  sharing my feelings and personal memories when I was a young child and these are only verifiable
*  as phenomena in my own mind and so I'm not sure that the term objective is the right term to use
*  here what was your family discussion table like um is with were very lively and because both my
*  parents were journalists that works with the political and law training and so democratization
*  is on the forefront of their minds and also because they were censored by the single party
*  a lot at the time and so I would read their drafts and the drafts being censored and they
*  will debate the sensor taking the case to the owner of the press if needed be and for environmental
*  justice and social justice and so on and so a lot of discussion was around censorship and the freedom
*  of press when I was really young are there cognitive advantages to being transgender
*  well of course I think it makes it easier to empathize with people and because I've gone
*  through some parts of your property no matter the gender of you and so I wouldn't feel that
*  half a population is different from me I would feel that I'm just part of homo sapiens this is a
*  large community do you think there are cognitive disadvantages of being transgender
*  um no I think people can be more transgender I mean when our minister Chen Shizhong the
*  commander of the central epidemic command center put on the medical mask to show solidarity to the
*  young boy who called to say that he doesn't want to go to school because pink masks being rationed
*  makes him look like he'll be bullied I think minister Chen and the medical officers became a
*  little bit more transgender on that very moment and so it's a practice like translation and
*  trans culture listen what's the biggest misconception about transgender life and existence
*  amongst intelligent educated people I have no idea I have not done a qualitative survey
*  now you didn't go through the cycle of being educated in the united states the way many
*  taiwanis do do you think that's given you a different perspective
*  I don't know I mean I mean the IETF and the internet itself maybe is really the the American
*  experiments value the united states value the value the united states written in a like 70 80
*  kind of view in code and so by working with internet technologies by working with
*  the implicit assumption of freedom of speech freedom assembly and the press end to end
*  innovation and permissionless innovation and things like that I think I'm more
*  imbued in the internet seeing more imbued American value in the internet than a traditional
*  education in the states would I think now of course nowadays the internet governance
*  is multicultural and there's multicultural internet domain names but we're still using
*  ASCII which is the A in ASCII is American and the idea that the empty American values imbued in the
*  internet are somehow universal of course are now being challenged but it's not lost I think the
*  core internet is still very much the values that unites the states now in 2014 you were part of a
*  group of activists that occupied Taiwan's parliament building what was your thinking behind
*  participation in that activity what were you hoping to accomplish what did you see as the
*  trade-offs yeah I've read and actually translated Manuel Castells in the ideas in the books network
*  of outrage and hope and earlier in communication powers and so we have the benefit I guess from
*  learning from previous occupiers such as the Occupy Wall Street of course but also the 15m
*  and other movements and so I started understanding that the more that you can make humor travel
*  faster than rumor the more you can get people interested in a kind of night market fun-ish kind
*  of way the less likely that the more divisive and the more revenge seeking part of a Occupy
*  movement will grow that is to say the conservative part in anarchism has a chance to thrive and
*  people have a chance to arrive to rough consensus and running code legal code in this case when they
*  can literally hum in the street and so my main work there is just with a bunch of people in the
*  zero community to set up communication infrastructure so that people can understand
*  what's really going on with their own eyes and participating in the journalism making without
*  being derailed by the rumors and disinformation campaigns that's bound to come with any occupier
*  how important is the skill of translation for becoming a better thinker I think it's very very
*  important but so also important is the skills of rotation and scaling were you afraid that working
*  in government would ruin or corrupt you no not at all I'm working with the government I'm not
*  working for the government what are your skills of rotation and scaling and how do you use them
*  in the government yeah scaling means that taking something that used to only happen between two
*  people or three people that's listening intently and scaling it using technology to make sure that
*  when I tour around Taiwan I can still listen intently to people who are social innovators in
*  their indigenous nation or their remote island or rural areas but at the same time through the
*  modern technology which seems like magic at times people from five municipalities from 12 central
*  government ministries can also listen as intently as I am to the stories and the innovations of the
*  local people and so that scales the listening idea and by rotation I mean taking all the sides
*  so whenever there are people of differing positions on an emerging topic it could be uber it could be
*  esports it could be 5g self-driving vehicles you name it if I find that I cannot argue from
*  any particular viewpoint I will book a couple days to spend time with the community on
*  ethnographic just hanging out and until I rotate my worldview and until I can argue from their
*  viewpoint and so that's called taking all the sides why aren't there more audrey tangs in the
*  other governments of the world I don't know I mean that's a question for the other government
*  maybe I think people were limited by the imagination of the government being a single
*  thing right we said internet governance we didn't say internet government if the IETF or ICANN
*  started calling themselves internet government I'm sure that there will be a lot of more limitation
*  in thinking in the multi-stakeholder approach but no we call it governance we don't call it government
*  so maybe just the word government itself limits people's imaginations and if rotation is fundamental
*  to your thought it seems that most governments in the literal sense of that term are not always so
*  interested in rotation right they want to push through a particular set of policies to serve
*  interest groups and constituencies toward the end of being re-elected well but election is a kind
*  of rotation it's just temporal right it rotates a little bit every four years sure but any particular
*  government is not interested in rotation per se in fact they would prefer its opposite over time
*  yeah but I'm talking about democratic cultures and democratic norms so if we shorten the iteration
*  to not four years but actually maybe 60 days as is the standard iteration in Taiwanese citizens
*  initiative the e-petition platform then we can iterate more each particular generation of course
*  in that 60 days are interested from their point of view but if you rotate quickly then even a
*  still pictures when rotated quickly looks like animation and actually that's where the word
*  animate came from it's just quickly animated frames if you think about your own life and career
*  over the next few years if you wish to increase your own empathy at the margin what do you feel
*  that calls for from you yeah I think a couple more things right I need to learn more languages
*  and now with the help of assistive intelligence such as machine learning and translation is
*  becoming much easier I take a step doing that translating how to use the traditional rest
*  cooker that you see right here to disinfect the masks so that it kills the virus but doesn't
*  destroy the pp material I translated it and narrated it in I think a dozen languages
*  and so it's a beginning but I look forward to learn more languages and communicate
*  in more languages and the other thing is also synthesize right more of the cultures that I
*  have come across into a more transcultural way of living transcultural way of thinking
*  and that includes up to the name of the country itself Taiwan the name of country is officially
*  chong hua mingguo which I translate as a transcultural republic of citizens and and now that's a
*  I wouldn't say universal but at least a world globally applicable view anyone can be part of
*  the transcultural republic citizens and which languages do you know now already javascript
*  pretty well yes well that's cool and python not very fluently ruby of course and so on there's
*  pretty english right c plus plus c sharp not really c sharp oh camel and also c anyway yes
*  um sorry uh camos f sharp uh yeah english of course but i think i think the paiwanese
*  yeah i think in english mostly nowadays if you talk about natural language and for me
*  mandarin are along with mandarin thomas holock which are my two native languages
*  i reserve them for more poetic expressions but my work language is not definitely english
*  audrey tang thank you very much it's been a great pleasure
