Video Description: To anthropologist Joseph Henrich, intelligence is overrated. Social learning, and its ability to influence biological evolution over time, is what really sets our species apart. He joined Tyler for a conversation on his work on cultural evolution, as well as his life among different tribes (academic and otherwise), Star Trek, big gods, small gods, Chinaâ€™s missing industrial revolution, the merits of coconut milk, the Flynn effect, American exceptionalism, and why he wants to travel in time to 6th-century Kent.

# Joseph Henrich on Cultural Evolution, WEIRD Societies, and Life Among Tribes  Convos with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRUyfW0ECNg)
*  Joe's book is called The Secret of Our Success. The secret of his success is amazing intellect
*  and drive. I would describe him as currently the leading theorist on how cultural and biological
*  evolution interact. He is an anthropologist at Harvard University, but much more than
*  that. He does experimental economics, political science, cultural, psychology, sociology.
*  He studied economics with Paul Romer. He's a true polymath. I described him during our
*  last session as, in a sense, the next Steven Pinker. So the introduction could be much
*  longer, but we'll talk more about Joe as we proceed. Now let me start with a simple question
*  about your method. So I'm an economist, and I'm familiar also with evolutionary biology.
*  So if I come at a problem, I tend to use economic reasoning and then something from biology.
*  You have insights from how cultural and social evolution intersect or interact. What would
*  be an example of something you try to explain with that framework that's much harder to
*  explain using only economics and biology?
*  Sure. That's a great question. So one example that I've been working a lot on lately is
*  how it is that in modern societies and in the last few hundred years, people all over
*  the world have come to believe in big gods. So gods that have power over life and death
*  can reward you in the afterlife. And what the implications are for cooperation and the
*  scaling up of human societies, these kinds of supernatural beliefs. For much of human
*  history, people believed in gods that were weak and whimsical, not very powerful. There
*  was no notion of afterlife. And so how can we explain this transformation of religions
*  over the last few thousand years?
*  So you think there's some kind of natural progression of religion as societies become
*  wealthier and more complex and intersecting cultural and genetic evolution help explain
*  that. Just fill in the piece.
*  Yeah, sure. So I mean some basic aspects of human cognition. For example, our ability
*  to read other minds or to do mentalizing, to infer the thoughts inside of other people's
*  heads makes us susceptible to dualism, to thinking that minds and bodies are separable.
*  This also, people who are better at mentalizing are more likely to believe in supernatural
*  agents. So this means there's a possibility for humans to believe in supernatural agents
*  and then various forms of cultural evolution can take a hold of this basic raw material
*  that's provided by aspects of our evolved minds. And one of the arguments I've made
*  is that societies that came to believe in certain kinds of supernatural agents, supernatural
*  agents with punishing power, with control over, with demanding certain kinds of behavior
*  in humans helps humans scale up human societies to cooperate more in larger groups.
*  So cultural evolution in a sense carries those means. You don't necessarily need group selection,
*  though that may be part of the story. But cultural evolution is a more powerful way
*  of propagating and replicating the means without groups having to die out necessarily. Though
*  both of those could be happening at the same time. Is that the right way to think about
*  it?
*  Yeah, I mean, you have intergroup competition. I mean, you know, you don't want to get tied
*  up in the semantic debate of group selection. But if some groups come to have sets of rituals
*  and beliefs that allow them to outcompete other groups, then those beliefs are going
*  to spread. And that's what seems to have occurred with certain kinds of supernatural beliefs.
*  So if we look at the earliest human societies, the first time you see monumental architecture,
*  it's always religious. It's always a temple or a tomb. And this seems to help consolidate
*  power and expand the sphere of reliable social interactions.
*  So let me give you a super simple take. I hear from a lot of people on how genetic and
*  cultural evolution interact. And tell me if you agree with it. So the standard story is
*  we have genes that were optimized for some earlier environment, maybe being hunter-gatherers.
*  So now we eat too much sugar, we become too fat, we have diabetes too often. We give our
*  leaders too much respect because we used to need them to stop ourselves from being killed.
*  So now we're too loyal to the president. We think in terms of anecdote and narrative
*  rather than statistics. And thus there's this quite radical mismatch between how we've evolved
*  and the society we live in. Is that an accurate picture in your account of things or not?
*  Well certainly part of that is an accurate account. So the importance of, say, our taste
*  for sugar, our taste for fat seems to be a misfiring from our ancestral environments.
*  But I think in the case of human cooperation, that doesn't fit the story. So if we look
*  at the smallest scale human societies, hunter-gatherers, they still rely on all kinds of social norms
*  and beliefs to cooperate, even when they're cooperating in relatively small bands. So
*  for example, food sharing in lots of hunter-gatherer societies relies on food taboos in which certain
*  classes of people can only eat certain parts of the animal. And if you eat a part of the
*  animal that's not assigned to your class, say, older married men or something, then
*  the whole group has poor hunting. And if people believe that, they're going to enforce that
*  taboo on other people and you create a self-interested incentive to share the meat. Hunter-gatherers
*  also have rituals and psychologists have now shown when you cooperate, when you participate
*  in communal rituals, you become more cooperative and you have greater social solidarity with
*  other members of your group. So even the smallest scale human societies are already using all
*  these tricks of cultural evolution to make them more social.
*  Now another feature of your model, if I understand it correctly, is that you get more rapid or
*  more complex or more interesting cultural evolution when you have a larger number of
*  moving parts. More people or more wealth or more complexity. Is it kind of increasing
*  returns to scale to cultural evolution? Is that fair to say?
*  Yeah. There's a couple different ways that that comes out. I think the simplest and clearest
*  one is this idea that I call the collective brain. And so this is simply the idea, because
*  we're so dependent on learning from each other in order to do innovations and to make
*  up to construct increasingly fancy technologies. Larger and more interconnected populations
*  tend to have fancier tools and technologies. So humans really don't think as individuals.
*  We don't innovate as individuals. We innovate as groups. And groups that for whatever reason
*  are able to create more social interconnections produce fancier tools and technology and they're
*  able to maintain larger bodies of know-how. So there are these great cases in the ethno-historical
*  record of groups like the polar Inuit who get cut off from the rest of the Inuit population
*  and then they begin to lose valuable tools and technology because their own brains remain
*  the same size, but their collective brain became severed. And so they're not able to
*  maintain as much know-how in the population. And that connection between size and speed
*  of cultural evolution, that's true at most margins? So say India evolves culturally more
*  rapidly than Denmark because it's larger? Well, I mean, so there's lots of pieces to
*  this puzzle, right? But the key is to create interconnectedness. So to explain the difference
*  between Denmark and India, of course Denmark is interconnected with many other populations,
*  but the flow of information is much less constricted. What happened in the scaling up of human societies
*  in many places is societies get built on complex kinship structures in which you don't have
*  very much relations between different families and between different tribes. And that constrains
*  the flow of social information among these groups. So the trick the West pulled off is
*  to manage to make individuals and so that information could freely flow among individuals.
*  Let's say I'm a cultural pessimist and try to talk me out of this, but here would be
*  my worry. If your theory implies cultural evolution speeds up as you have more parts,
*  more people, more interconnections, I worry that social evolution will bring us further
*  from the point of what our genes can handle. So think of there being an increased variance
*  of the match between society and our genes. Most things do in fact work better because
*  cultural evolution carries a lot of useful knowledge, but just a few things stop working,
*  like maybe electoral politics, believe it or not, or the diets we eat, or a few things
*  in society go wrong. And if you think of everything needing to work fairly well in society for
*  it to sustain itself, should we then be cultural pessimists?
*  Well before I get to the cultural pessimist question, I think a key insight is that we've
*  been in that situation for probably over a million years. So human cultural products
*  like tools and food processing abilities have been shaping our guts and our teeth and our
*  hands for a really long time. And culture was always pushing up against these things
*  and the slow process here is the genetic evolution. It takes the genetic evolution a long time
*  to respond, to expand our brains and make them be able to deal with all the new world
*  that's being created by cultural evolution. So the world we're facing now is just more
*  the same. As far as cultural pessimism, things could get better, things could get worse.
*  I don't have any predictions.
*  Now we have the internet, so that's very rapidly multiplied, the number of combinations and
*  connections over a 20-year period, much quicker than almost anyone had forecast. So if we
*  apply that to your model, what does your model predict if only in broad terms? What effects
*  will the internet have on society given that genetic and cultural evolution are interacting
*  and the number of permutations has gone up a lot quicker than we expected? Is this a
*  train wreck waiting to happen or the greatest thing since sliced bread, but 10,000 times
*  better?
*  Certainly in the short term it should increase the rate of innovation because it's easy to
*  exchange ideas amongst very diverse minds.
*  But productivity growth is falling in most countries. This baffles me.
*  You mean why productivity growth is falling?
*  Right. Japan, US, Western Europe, productivity growth is lower than it was say before the
*  80s. I don't blame the internet for that, but it doesn't seem to have helped very much.
*  Well I mean I think you, I'm a cultural evolutionist so I want to see this on a much longer time
*  scale.
*  Okay.
*  So ask me in 200 years.
*  Okay, 200 years. We'll have you back for a second episode.
*  Now another area of interaction between genetic and cultural evolution, people talk about
*  it a lot, but they don't always agree on the facts and that's assortative mating. So the
*  claim that like marries like more today than in earlier periods of time. A, is that part
*  of your theory? B, empirically do you think it's true? So you may have law partners marrying
*  each other rather than say a lawyer marrying an assistant. And is that so much different
*  from two high school valedictorians getting married in 1954? Is that one of the forces
*  shaping American society today or not?
*  Yeah, that's not something I've looked into. I certainly think compared to small scale
*  societies, it seems like there's a lot more opportunity for assortative mating in the
*  world today because your choices were just quite limited. I've worked in three small
*  scale societies and you just don't have a lot of choices. So certainly seems likely
*  over the long run that that's increased, but that's not something I focused on.
*  In which ways does culture make us dumb?
*  Which ways? Well so it removes a lot of need to think because it gives us pre-built solutions
*  to problems, it gives us protocols so that we don't have to figure out things for ourselves,
*  just lots of pre-built solutions. So it tells us what we need to think and what we need
*  to know in order to survive in the world.
*  So it's made us dumb in ways X, Y and Z, but what would be an example today?
*  It's also made us smarter though.
*  Oh sure, I know it's made us much smarter. But what would be an area today where we're
*  acting in a dumber way because of culture?
*  Well so for one thing we're all much dumber, at least in terms of the amount of societal
*  knowledge we have in our heads compared to our ancestors. So if we go far enough back,
*  every single person had to know everything about how to find food, cook food, every feature
*  of the productive system, how to make all the tools. Now left to our own devices, we
*  wouldn't be able to do the first thing in order to recreate the productive system that
*  we have. So we've been breaking knowledge down into smaller and smaller parts. So in
*  terms of our ability to produce for ourselves, it's gotten smaller and smaller. And in the
*  book I have these cases of lost European explorers where a particular group of explorers gets
*  struck in an environment where hunter-gatherers have survived for centuries and they're faced
*  with the challenge of surviving. And of course they can't because they're missing this large
*  accumulated body that the hunter-gatherers got for free, but it helps you find food and
*  avoid disease and travel and all those kinds of things.
*  As you know it's a common 18th century theme that the division of labor possibly will make
*  us stupid or uninteresting. And it seems that was wrong in the 18th century. Nicholas Carr
*  has argued, well Google makes us all shallow and we lose the ability to remember things.
*  Will that also be wrong? Well, I mean, the thing is we have probably
*  been losing memory abilities. So as soon as we can write, we can offload lots of information
*  that we normally have to keep in our heads. So I've always been impressed living in small
*  scale societies, the number of stories that people tell over campfires and just the amount
*  of say folk biological information, information about plants and animals and poisonous and
*  what you can eat and what you can't eat and how you have to process it. So there's just
*  this encyclopedic knowledge which I would just use the handbook for a lot of that information,
*  but that's not available to you. So we've been kind of gradually figuring out ways to
*  download stuff and I think that's the kind of Google problem is that we have less stuff
*  in our heads, but our ability to do things can still expand.
*  So from what I understand, people had larger brains 20 or 30,000 years ago and brain size
*  roughly is correlated with intelligence. Is it possible that they were smarter than we
*  are and we're a kind of mental cripple in a way, but we get by because in essence we're
*  riding on the back of this marvelous cultural evolution?
*  Yeah, so I do think that the division of labor could explain that decline, but there's also
*  been a self-domestication process where domesticated animals have smaller brains and so we've been
*  gradually domesticating each other. For some reason, which is a little bit unclear, animals
*  that have to engage in more aggression against each other have larger brains.
*  And that would be us, right?
*  But so we've been reducing our, we've been getting less violent for quite a long time
*  actually.
*  So there could be a long run dysfunctionality the more peaceful we become. There's less
*  competitive pressure put on us and we'll stultify mentally, institutionally, other ways.
*  I'm not sure that that necessarily follows.
*  But it's a coherent cultural pessimist scenario.
*  I'll have to think about it more.
*  But presumably in your model, unless intergroup competition kicks in in some new way, which
*  it might, but it's implicitly a tale of cultural decline, it looks wonderful on the surface
*  and you're getting net benefits any period of time, but the longer run mismatch between
*  culture and the genes seems to be increasing because one evolves much quicker than the
*  other and the cultural evolution is speeding up.
*  Well actually genetic evolution has been speeding up for the last 10,000 years. So genes is
*  genes are trying and actually genes can evolve faster in larger populations. So as the population
*  gets bigger, genes can actually respond more. Now of course it'll never go with the rate
*  of cultural evolution.
*  But you think that's sexual selection, group selection, speeding up genetic evolution?
*  I think it's individual garden variety selection responding to a culturally constructed environment.
*  So a lot of the genes that we know that have been selected over the last 10,000 years are
*  response to agriculture. So blue eyes in people of the Baltic area is due to high-latitude
*  agriculture. There's the famous case of lactose genes which is due to not having cheese and
*  yogurt processing but still having access to cow's milk. And there's just one example
*  after another of these kind of genes that are driven by agricultural technology.
*  So Belor at Brown University, you probably know this work, there's a number of papers
*  arguing societies that have been producing agriculture for longer periods of time, they're
*  today much more cooperative and there's something, if not quite permanent about that, something
*  long run, something enduring about that. Do you agree with that hypothesis?
*  Well I think the data is there. The question is why? And one of the things that I don't
*  think he takes into account sufficiently is that there can be long run cultural differences
*  between populations. And what he really means by more cooperative is that they're better
*  at doing state level societies.
*  But if they play economic games with each other, they'll share more, they're less likely
*  to take the whole pie.
*  Dealing with strangers, higher levels of patience, yep. But that could all be, I mean so we know
*  we can move patients around for example with cultural differences.
*  And how persistent do you think those cultural differences are? So you also know the literature
*  when migrants come to the United States, two or three generations later, their children,
*  grandchildren tend to have a lot of the cooperative traits of the country their grandparents came
*  from. And that decays, but it decays more slowly than a lot of people had thought.
*  Yeah, so I think that's great evidence that it's likely to be cultural and likely not
*  to be genetic, because if it was genetic it wouldn't go away in a few generations. So
*  it seems like they're bringing heritage from the place and it's getting retransmitted because
*  they're in ethnic communities or they're parents and then it disappears once they kind
*  of converge to the local meat.
*  Say the Bill Easterly paper, I think it's Bill Easterly, it goes back to the year 500
*  AD and per capita GDP in 500 AD predicts per capita GDP today relatively well, at least
*  much better than almost any other model would lead you to think. Now it could be cherry
*  picking 500 AD actually may do better than 1500 AD, but do you think that result is just
*  an artifact or is it reflecting the fact that cultural evolution runs deep and once
*  you're in a good groove it tends to be self-reinforcing?
*  Yeah, because you're developing all kinds of institutions that themselves can endure
*  both formal institutions and informal institutions, family practices, cultural values. So I think
*  you're capturing a lot of that.
*  And how quick is the catch up in that process? So the West has a lot of contact with the
*  world in the 18th and 19th centuries or maybe a bit earlier, brings Western norms, not always
*  in a welcome manner and often with violence. There's a debate in the economics literature
*  how much growth convergence is there? If you put on your cultural evolution plus genetic
*  evolution hat, on net do you expect the poor countries to converge to the wealthy countries
*  or not?
*  Yes, well I mean I think we've seen a lot of convergence. I mean certainly lots of places
*  that were poor 100 years ago are now relatively richer. So you're seeing a certain amount
*  of convergence. Now one of the big problems is that key to this, understanding all this,
*  are family level institutions. So small scale societies, developing countries depend on
*  complex kinship institutions, which are really hard to break down. So what you're doing is
*  you're putting Western style institutions on top of an underlying set of family institutions
*  that doesn't fit. And that misfit causes a lot of problems and it's only through process
*  of urbanization that you gradually break apart those families.
*  But say we take Brazil, which is actually a pretty well off society compared to a lot
*  of parts of the world. The ratio of American, North American, US per capita GDP to Brazilian
*  in the year 1900 is pretty much the same as it is now, as best we can measure it. And
*  is that an argument for a different kind of cultural pessimism? That the lock in effects
*  are strong enough, Brazil's much better off, it's arguably more Western in some way, whatever
*  that might mean. But Brazil isn't really catching up on the United States. It seems.
*  Well but do you disagree that as a broad statistical pattern there's been a lot of economic growth
*  in the rest of the world in which there's convergence? I mean East Asia for sure.
*  I think we don't know from the numbers. I think if you look at all countries together
*  you can debate either side, whether countries as a whole are converging on the richest countries.
*  So I would say I'm not sure.
*  Okay. And the data that I've seen seems to suggest some convergence.
*  Certainly within the United States we're sure there's the opposite of convergence. So Silicon
*  Valley and Bethesda, Maryland are getting richer and West Virginia's not catching up
*  with them. There was convergence in the 50s and 60s, but across cities, counties in the
*  US we're quite sure there's the opposite of convergence. And that clearly is purely cultural
*  and economic, right? It's going to have nothing to do with genetics. And there seem to be
*  a lot of scenarios where you never get convergence. You have a kind of averages over scenario
*  and the world diverges.
*  Yeah. I mean so the challenge that complex societies have always faced is that when they
*  get big enough they break down into little pieces. And systems for maintaining uniformity
*  have always been a problem. So if you look at human history, what you'll often see is
*  the expansion of one group rapidly conquering or otherwise assimilating a large area. And
*  then that group gradually breaks down as the inability to maintain cultural uniformity.
*  Now you have a view communicated in a lot of your research, some of your most famous
*  pieces that people in the West or at least some people in the West, they are what you
*  call weird. And that's an acronym for Western educated, industrialized, rich and democratic.
*  And we should not draw general conclusions about humanity on the basis of weird people.
*  And most of us here, possibly all of us, we're deeply weird. Tell us a little more about
*  that.
*  Yeah. So in around 2006 I arrived at the University of British Columbia and I had been in an anthropology
*  department at Emory University and I met a couple of cultural psychologists and we got
*  to talking over lunch and we realized in each of the areas for which we were experts on
*  that Westerners were unusual compared to all the other populations that had been studied.
*  So we thought this was interesting and we began to compile all the available data we
*  could find where Western populations were compared against some larger global sample.
*  And what we found in not every but a large number of important domains in the psychological
*  and behavioral sciences that Westerners were at the extreme end of the distribution. So
*  I mean this made us worry and I think it ought to make lots of people worry about the typical
*  textbook conclusions that you would find in psychology textbooks. And much of behavioral
*  economics at least at the time was based on running experiments on undergrads. And it's
*  actually mostly American undergrads that are studied.
*  So for instance, peoples are better at cooperating if they have had many generations in a market
*  economy or needing to do a lot of cooperative hunting. That would be an example of how we're
*  weird. So we have some positive some mentality that maybe is relatively rare in the world.
*  Right. And so this is, so the case that I've made for this particular is that, you know,
*  in order to make markets work we need particular social norms for how to deal with strangers
*  and interact with them in a mutually beneficial way. And in the smallest scale human societies
*  you have social norms for dealing with different kinds of relatives and people you have a certain
*  kind of relationship with. But this kind of general purpose norm for how you're going
*  to treat anybody is a product of cultural evolution. And much of what I think we measure
*  in behavioral economics, experimental economics, is actually just a measurement of a culturally
*  local social norm. Culturally local. So if I try to tie this to other areas of psychology,
*  so we all know that the Flynn effect that measured IQ each generation, at least in the
*  West, probably many other places, it goes up consistently just by having a new generation.
*  It goes up a surprisingly large amount. Is this the same as the Flynn effect? Is it operating
*  in parallel? Is it explaining the Flynn effect? Is the Flynn effect explaining this? Is the
*  Flynn effect real or artifact? What's your take on how the big picture fits together?
*  So I don't think there's any relation between these numbers. So efforts to control for IQ
*  or intelligence scores don't seem to predict behavioral games. There's a few exceptions
*  to that. So I don't think those are linked. The Flynn effect is a great example. People
*  tend to think of IQ as being a product of genes and certainly genes make a contribution
*  to IQ. Although the heritability of IQ actually depends on the population you use. So you
*  pick one population, you get a high heritability saying there's lots of genetic influence of
*  .8. That would be like middle class, upper class Americans. But if you study low class
*  Americans, it's like .2, .1. That's because there's a lot of variation in the environments
*  that people in lower classes face compared to the relatively homogeneous environments
*  that they face in upper classes. So that's just a comment on IQ heritability. But the
*  Flynn effect I think is a great example of people adapting their cognition to the economic
*  and social world that they face. So they've got to deal with new kinds of problems and
*  that's going to favor more analytic thinking. So most of the increase in the Flynn effect
*  is due to the three subtests. So there's ten subtests on the IQ test and three of them
*  are about analytic thinking. And those are the three that have really dramatically gone
*  up over the last hundred years. But the Flynn effect in the short run puzzles me more than
*  in the long run. So if I compared a date of the 18th century, I can see where the difference
*  might be. But in many countries it seems the Flynn effect hasn't stopped. Nutritional gains
*  probably are over. The environment smartphones are newer than the Flynn effect. But it doesn't
*  seem to be changing now compared to a generation ago. They both seem quite complex. We've had
*  TV for a while. People have books. Market society. I mean what exactly is the difference
*  over the last generation in the short run? So it's a cultural evolutionary treadmill.
*  So one place where you see this is the complexity of television shows. So now you have like
*  an ensemble cast and 20 different plots going on and you've got to track all these different
*  plots. That wasn't the television of the 1950s. It was one plot, one thing after another.
*  So now we're just, the whole world is getting more complex, at least in terms of your need
*  for analytic thinking. And some of that in your view is a supply side effect. So it's
*  not that we got smarter and they made TV better. It's also they made TV better and that made
*  some of us smarter. Co-evolutionary. Co-evolutionary. So this is going to make you out to be quite
*  an optimist there. Because TV is going to get better and better. We're just going to
*  keep on getting smarter. Yeah, of course. But we tie that back in with the people 30,000
*  years ago having bigger brains and maybe they were smarter. Somehow how the whole picture
*  operates. Is it that the variance of our smarts goes up and we use as a crutch the areas where
*  we're really stupid? Is that what the picture looks like? So one of the cases I make in
*  the book is that a lot of our intelligence, we have this tendency to think that our intelligence
*  is about raw brain processing power. But I make the case that a lot of our intelligence
*  comes from our culturally downloaded tools. So a simple example is all of you have a numbering
*  system that you can count without bound. But the smallest scale human societies will count
*  one, two, three, many. So they can't differentiate 36 from 37. And you can see the full variation
*  of numbering systems by looking at these body part counting systems. So some groups in New
*  Guinea will have a body part counting system that goes up to 27. Another one will have
*  one that goes up to 17. Somewhere in cultural evolution we developed this ability to count
*  without bound. Once we do that we actually get new cognitive abilities. So when you grow
*  up with this new kind of system you get abilities you didn't have before. The same thing is
*  true of our spatial cognitive abilities. So in English there's three different spatial
*  reference systems. So there's absolute north, south, east and west. There's body centered,
*  left, right, front, back. And then there's also a relative one. So between me and the
*  door I could say she's to the left of the door. And that's by drawing a line between
*  myself and the doorway and then using that as a reference point. But in some languages
*  they just have north, south, east and west. So they can't tell you to drive on the left
*  or drive on the right because it's not one of the systems that's built in there. And
*  so once you have those you can redeploy them in all kinds of fancy ways to do new stuff.
*  So cultural evolution is making us smarter by giving us all these new cognitive tricks.
*  And I think something else is important. People often conflate biological differences with
*  genetic differences. So culture changes our biology even when it doesn't change our genetics.
*  So in the book I make this long term story that culture's been shaping our genetic evolution.
*  But it also shapes our biology. So a simple example is everyone in this room I would say
*  with I can't be 100% sure but you have a specialization in your left hemisphere and you have a thicker
*  corpus callosum than you would otherwise. But you've acquired a particular cultural skill,
*  that changes your brain and makes you biologically different and actually thickens that information
*  highway between your two hemispheres. So when you hear spoken speech you get greater full
*  brain activation patterns than you would if you'd still been illiterate. So culture changes
*  our biology and causes us to think differently. So we're at George Mason University. I need
*  to ask you about Hayek. Hayek had a theory that we still have atavistic instincts. We
*  have the instincts of a collectivist people with strong sharing norms which we needed
*  when we were near subsistence. But we're now much wealthier and these norms are dysfunctional
*  and in fact they give us a bad politics. Agree? Disagree? What's your take on this?
*  Well I think I can agree with the broad claim. So the thing, one of the things we always
*  face in complex societies, meritocratic based societies is there's a tendency for people
*  to want to surround themselves by people that are loyal to them, by family and friends and
*  people who owe them things, right? That we call this corruption. In most human societies
*  this was called business as usual. So there is this tendency to want to surround yourself
*  with those loyal to you, those of your same tribe, ethnic group, all those kinds of things.
*  And so maintaining well functioning institutions requires constantly resisting the tendency
*  to surround yourself with reciprocal partners and family members that would otherwise corrupt
*  the system. Let me try a somewhat related question and
*  I'm not at all intending this as asking you about your personal views on politics. But
*  let me pose the question and then circle back to what I'm really trying to ask. I look at
*  your research, so you have papers, we learn better from teachers who are like us in some
*  way, maybe slightly senior, but they're similar in terms of their groups. Religion is something
*  that's very pro-social. There's a kind of wisdom in intuitions about repugnance, not
*  always, but often. There's a wisdom to these carried intuitions. There's a high value to
*  cultural evolution. War in some cases can foster cooperation, especially over the longer
*  haul. Biology really matters and the West is quite distinctive in terms of what we do
*  and how we think and the culture we've developed. And I'm not trying to ask, you know, personally
*  are your views conservative? But in some temperamental sense, if I can just whisper this, I mean,
*  do you ever feel, even here, does it make you conservative? Believing all these things?
*  I just follow the trail where it goes and I don't think of these things as conservative
*  ideas. I don't mean conservative in the sense of modern political parties, but in the sense
*  in the broad sweep of human history, there are conservative thinkers such as Edmund Burke
*  would be one or Adam Smith. And you could argue today, right now the Democratic party
*  is in some ways more conservative than the Republican party. Do you think of yourself
*  fundamentally as a conservative thinker in that sense?
*  I'm not sure. So I don't think I really thought about that question. One of the things I think,
*  thinking about cultural evolution and the scaling up of human societies and the adaptive
*  nature of culture means that when you see a practice, you're thinking about how could
*  that have emerged, why would it have spread? You need some way of making sense of that.
*  So one of the things I've worked on is a normative monogamy. So it's really puzzling that in
*  most so much of the world today, we have laws that prohibit elite males from taking additional
*  wives. And 85% of human societies have allowed polygyny. So this is an example of one of
*  these things where what is monogamous marriage doing, if anything? And I wrote this paper
*  where I made the argument that it actually reduces male-male competition. So it's a very
*  biological argument. It actually lowers male testosterone and it reduces crime rates and
*  has a bunch of kind of positive pro-social effects.
*  It's a kind of redistribution in a sense.
*  Yeah, it's sexual egalitarianism.
*  And there was a wisdom to that even before we could articulate those gains.
*  And the people who spread that themselves don't appear to have known what it was doing.
*  They believed God wanted it that way or something.
*  And that was an efficient form of cultural evolution.
*  But it gave a competitive advantage to the societies that adopted it. And then other
*  societies began copying the West. So for example, China adopts Western marriage norms in 1950.
*  China, I mean, sorry, China does it in 1950. Japan adopts it in the Meiji Restoration in
*  the 1880s. Nepal doesn't adopt it until 1963. I mean, it's all relatively recent.
*  Now, in all of these dialogues, we have a segment in the middle called underrated versus
*  overrated. And I name a thing, a person, a thinker. You're always free to pass.
*  Okay.
*  And you tell us if you think it's underrated or overrated. And I'll start with secular
*  humanism.
*  Pass.
*  You pass. Okay. Stephen Pinker would not have passed, I think.
*  Maybe my pronunciation is wrong. The Sonawa Islands in Fiji.
*  Sonawa Islands?
*  Soana? The outlying islands in Fiji where you've done field work.
*  They're great.
*  They're great?
*  So properly rated? I don't know.
*  What's interesting about them that you don't see when you go to the more heavily touristy
*  parts of Fiji?
*  Yeah. So people still live in traditional ways of life. They plant yams. They live in
*  complex kinship groups. They cooperate. They have hereditary chiefs.
*  You've done a lot of field work in Michigan studying Iraqi Chaldean Christians. That's
*  a longstanding cultural norm. The city of Detroit. Underrated or overrated?
*  Properly rated.
*  Properly rated. Okay. Herbert Spencer. Probably the greatest 19th century theorist. I've had
*  social and genetic evolution interact.
*  Yeah. So I'll give him an underrated just because I feel like there's a lot of good stuff there
*  that one could still learn from even if you don't agree with everything he said. Sometimes
*  people say they don't like him because he had this kind of evolutionist view of humanity,
*  but there's still some good stuff there that's worth checking out.
*  Claude Levi-Strauss. Underrated or overrated?
*  Overrated.
*  Why?
*  I just, I mean, no evolutionary approach. I mean, kind of a, too much nativism without
*  evolution. I don't like nativism without evolution.
*  And when you say nativism, what do you mean?
*  So the idea that there are innate structures without supplying a theory about why those
*  structures would have emerged.
*  Okay. What's your favorite television show?
*  Star Trek.
*  Which one?
*  I'm really a new generation guy, although I think I like them all.
*  Why a new generation? What did we learn from Star Trek?
*  Well, lots of great things. It's about, you know, it's kind of like an anthropological
*  quest, right? So Captain Kirk was originally based on Captain Cook. And the idea was you're
*  going out to encounter new different peoples. And of course, in Star Trek, you go out into
*  space and do it. Captain Cook was doing it in the Pacific and around the world. So we
*  learn about ourselves by seeing ourselves projected in other peoples and other cultures
*  and other societies.
*  And if you think of the implicit vision of how cooperative different groups can become,
*  including people from different planets, in various varieties of Star Trek, as an anthropologist,
*  that seems realistic to you or utopian?
*  I just thought it was fun.
*  Coconut milk as a cooking medium, overrated or underrated?
*  Underrated.
*  Underrated.
*  Yeah.
*  And what do you enjoy in coconut milk?
*  Just fish. Fish.
*  Fish in coconut milk.
*  In the village I work in, in Fiji, we do a lot of fish in coconut milk.
*  And that's your favorite thing to eat in Fiji?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Especially, well, I like the eel. We do a lot of moire eel.
*  You've done a lot of field work in southern central Chile with the Mapuche. What would
*  you say is the main thing you personally have learned from the Mapuche in terms of your
*  research?
*  Well, the Mapuche was the main source for an idea that I'm working on now. And the idea
*  is that some, one of the cultural ways of interpreting the world is as a zero-sum game.
*  And that envy and witchcraft can play an important role in influencing economic behavior and
*  economic development. So the Mapuche I saw clearly that they, you know, if they, someone
*  else in the community did well, that meant that everybody else in the community had to
*  do worse because there's a limited good in the world. Anthropologist named George Foster
*  famously describes this. So people would hide when they had a good crop and they brought
*  in a big yield. They would like underplay it and try to hide how much they did. And,
*  you know, they might have had a particularly good fertilizer. They might have figured out
*  a new cropping technique. But that would be concealed from dissemination because of this
*  concern that if people knew they were doing well, they would envy them and then bad stuff
*  So envy and people's negative emotions has, people believe it has a real force in the
*  world and it can cause bad stuff to happen to you. So this I think is one of the main
*  challenges to some economic development in some places.
*  Amongst the weird people, how fragile do you think the positive-sum mentality is? So can
*  you readily imagine that 30, 40, 50 years from now we've in some way regressed and become
*  much more zero-sum? Or would that be extremely unlikely?
*  Yeah, I mean I think it's a ready ability for us to see the world in zero-sum terms.
*  And I don't think it takes very much to push people into zero-sum thinking.
*  And you think it's scarcity or slow growth or ethnic conflict or what are the triggers?
*  Well the main thing would be negative growth and, yeah, conflict with various groups. I
*  mean we don't know yet, but those are my suspicions.
*  We have some cases like say the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. It fights a vicious war.
*  Not too long before it seemed levels of ethnic conflict were going to prove manageable if
*  you look at measures such as intermarriage or just domestic violence. And then all of
*  a sudden things break loose and you would think at this time people would have had optimistic
*  views about the future and maybe wished to go their own way but not fight on such a scale.
*  And what's the right conceptual framework for thinking about conflicts like that?
*  Well I mean I don't know much about that conflict but I mean I didn't want to speak too quickly
*  on the idea that the zero-sum thing can change. I think it can go from positive sum to zero-sum
*  relatively quickly but at least in the studies that anthropologists have done in different
*  parts of the world the zero-sum thinking can get really embedded. So just because things
*  are going good for a little while external forces can cause economies to grow and people
*  could still have fundamentally zero-sum thinking or at least be able to drop back into it pretty
*  quickly. So that kind of thing could help explain this situation.
*  Now you've done a lot of work on religion and the social role of religion and how religion
*  can have a pro-social role and the costly signaling of certain things through religion can be
*  useful. What is your view on how what seem to be some atheistic societies can be so orderly?
*  Possible nominations would be Japan or Sweden. Those are subject to possible challenge. Is
*  it that you think religion gets replicated through some kind of non-religious belief
*  or you think there's really some different set of categories of thought where you can
*  in a sense move beyond religion and still cooperate?
*  So the case we make in this paper we wrote recently reviewing all this work is that these
*  big god religions that we talk about allow for the construction of well functioning secular
*  institutions but once you have well functioning secular institutions then religion loses its
*  functionality and begins to ebb away. And so one of the best predictors in Europe of not
*  being religious of atheism is good social safety nets. And so the reason why the US
*  is such an outlier in being so religious is one not such a great social safety net and
*  actually variation across states in that which predicts religiosity. And the second one is
*  the kind of free market for religion. So religious freedom meant you had the kind of production
*  of the wall marked of religion so you don't get that in European powers. So the combination
*  of those two things explain why the US has religiosity closer to Lebanon.
*  Let's say Japan which doesn't have an enormous safety net. It has in some ways more cooperation
*  through families and they're possibly the most atheistic society in the world. And is
*  it ethno-nationalism that carries that or some embedded ethics since medieval times?
*  Yeah I think it's an open question as to how much religion there is in Japan. Certainly
*  when you ask people, people think religion means the Christian god and people say no
*  to that question. But then if you start talking about other kinds of beings and spirits and
*  agents people get a little bit softer. Sure quite a bit softer perhaps. Something else
*  I find interesting in your work is the sense of how firmly we can believe in some god or
*  gods and how hard it is to get us to believe in others. So very few people today believe
*  in Zeus or if they do it might be a kind of joke or affectation. And this split in our
*  intuitions between these very firm loyalties and these very loose loyalties. Now there
*  are some societies, I think Haiti and the Caribbean would be an example where that seems
*  much more fluid. You can talk people into new gods at times. It's not easy but it's
*  probably easier there than here. And what accounts for that across societies? The ease
*  of believing in additional gods.
*  Yeah I think the standard way for what looking at religions all around the world is that
*  most people accepted that their tribe or their clan or their group had a god and naturally
*  that meant that other people's tribes or groups had a god. So the world was, there were lots
*  of gods and you just dealt with your god and they had their god.
*  Hinotheism, yeah.
*  And what was unique about the Abrahamic religions was that they at a certain point in their
*  history, in the past they were more similar to everybody else but then they decided there
*  was only one god and the other gods were non-existent. And this may have given them
*  a competitive advantage because then you go and you actually try to stomp out. Christian
*  missionaries, I've encountered them in Peruvian Amazon and other places and they're hard at
*  work at this because it takes a long time to convince people that all these other beings
*  don't exist.
*  And that's a competitive advantage through group selection or through the means of cultural
*  evolution?
*  Yeah so it's divided loyalty. So the problem in Europe was that people still maintained
*  their ancestor gods and the Catholic church wanted them to believe in the Catholic god
*  and it's trying to serve two masters. So you can do that but it's really better if you
*  get rid of the ancestor gods which might have been one of the reasons why the Catholic church
*  dismantled all these complex kinship systems that led to ancestor worship. And then you
*  get people fully invested in the one church and the one god.
*  And that's correlated with higher cooperation on other matters?
*  Well here's what we know.
*  People being weirder?
*  Our effort to test this is to go to places around the world where people believe in the
*  Christian god but also maintain local gods. And then we look at their willingness to cheat
*  in an experiment and we find that the more they believe in the Christian god, our other
*  big gods too, works with Islam, the more they believe that god is punishing and monitoring
*  them then the more cooperative they were in the game, less willing to cheat they were.
*  But their belief in the local god either didn't have an effect or caused them to go the other
*  way. So one of the ways we deal with this is we unconsciously prime them of either their
*  local god or the big god. And in the case of the local god it usually makes them more
*  pro their in group whereas priming the big god made them more fair towards out group
*  members, towards this larger circle of co-religionists.
*  So maybe more cosmopolitan, more likely to buy into nationalism for larger people.
*  So the idea is the one god is for building a big society and the other god is for galvanizing
*  cooperation in this village.
*  And then if you have cultural evolution operating more quickly for larger units that will be
*  correlated with a more rapid pace of cultural evolution and carrying more positive...
*  It allows you to scale up basically.
*  So there is in this account some positive external social benefit to a lot of forms
*  of monotheism.
*  Yeah. That's the idea.
*  Yeah. That's very interesting. What would be a prediction you would make about religion
*  that you think a lot of other frameworks would not or could not make?
*  Well, I mean the typical evolutionary approaches to religion don't take into account that the
*  kinds of gods we see in religions in the world today are not seen in small scale societies.
*  So you know I mentioned the ancestor gods. Other kinds of spirits can be tricked, duped,
*  bought off, paid, you sacrifice in order to get them to do something. They're not concerned
*  about moral behavior. So whatever your story is it's got to explain how you got these bigger
*  gods.
*  Now the kind of obvious alternative is people make believe in gods that reflect their society.
*  So what we've been trying to do is work to see if those gods are doing any work. It might
*  be that people believe in bigger gods but can they lead to greater cooperation or other
*  kinds of pro-social benefits? So that's why we've done all these experiments in different
*  parts of the world, trying to see if there's any evidence for this.
*  And if you're thinking about a series of connected problems, say the origins of the Industrial
*  Revolution, how we should spend foreign aid, how economic development can be encouraged,
*  for this reason do you see the roles of ideas and religions as primary, as driving forces
*  or not so much?
*  Yeah. So in my latest project I'm really looking at the kind of spread of the Western Church
*  into Europe and how it transformed the social structure in ways that I think led to individualism.
*  It led to a different kind of cultural psychology that would eventually pave the way for secular
*  institutions and economic growth. So the church is the first mover in that account.
*  And what did the British and the Dutch arguably have that say other parts of Europe, or for
*  that matter China, might not have had as much of?
*  Well in the case of the, when the church first began to spread its marriage and family program
*  where it would dissolve all these complex kinship groups and it altered marriage so
*  it ended polygyny, it ended cousin marriage which stopped the kind of, forced people to
*  marry further away which would build contacts between larger groups. That actually starts
*  in 600 in Kent, Anglo-Saxon Kent and then missionaries then spread out into Holland
*  and Northern France and places like that. So at least in terms of timing the marriage
*  and family program gets its start in southern England.
*  And what's your take on how China fits into this picture? Because during the Song Dynasty
*  a lot of economic historians feel, well there might have been, could have been, should have
*  been an industrial revolution. There wasn't. China ends up stagnating for a while, has
*  a disastrous 19th century. But it's still the case that Chinese immigrants coming to
*  the west, even not from wealthy backgrounds, they seem to assimilate into weird culture
*  very rapidly and very successfully. How does that fit this picture?
*  Well, so they're not monotheistic in any simple way.
*  Yep. Well so there's two questions. There's one is why didn't you get an industrial revolution
*  in China? And I mean they're always going to be impeded by the fact that there was a
*  strong patrilineal clan system, cousin marriage, all these things to prevent individualism
*  which is the fuel for entrepreneurship and individual innovation. So you can't get that
*  going or it's harder to get that going. Now because of this large cultural capital that's
*  been built up in China for having a state for a very long time, having early agriculture,
*  you have a lot of cultural capital in migrants that they then take when they move. So they're
*  arriving with a bunch of cultural stuff that allows you to do well in societies like the
*  US. So they somehow maintain that cultural capital
*  without moving on to the most rapid growth path.
*  Oh you mean the, why China doesn't move on? Right, so China now arguably is moving on
*  to that path. But if you start in say 1730 when China might have been wealthier per capita
*  than France, you have a long period of decline, maybe two and a half centuries for the most
*  part. And yet so much of that remains intact at the level of individual family. That Chinese
*  migration in terms of per capita incomes goes very well very quickly.
*  And I mean there were still functioning markets, there was still a functioning state, I mean
*  there was still an economic system that was pretty complex, linked lots of different places.
*  And of course since the 1950s China has been pushing exactly the same marriage and family
*  program that the Catholic Church started pushing in 600 in Europe. So they dissolved
*  cousin marriage. They actually did the same thing as the church where first they ended
*  first cousin marriage and then a little later they ended second cousin marriage, ended polygyny,
*  all those kinds of things. So they've been transforming the society from the grass roots
*  and China can do this because it's such a powerful state, right? This would be hard
*  for any other state to do. What's your opinion on American exceptionalism
*  culturally? I know you're from Canada. Well I mean in terms of the weird psychology,
*  Yes, are we special in some way? Yeah, well so in a lot of our measures, you
*  can't always detect it, but Americans turn out to be weirder than Canada and weirder
*  than the rest of Europe. And in which way are we weirder than Canadians?
*  So more individualistic, a little more analytic thinking.
*  Do we really have more instrumental rationality? I don't observe it these days.
*  Yeah, yeah, valid point. And let's see, so what was the other, so greater overconfidence,
*  more focus on the self. So part of the individualism thing is an obsession with the self and the
*  attributes and individual achievements. So Americans are particularly obsessed with themselves.
*  And do you have an account of how much neighbors matter? So it's a common debate in development
*  economics like Mexico versus Brazil. They're right about the same level of per capita income.
*  Mexico's immediate neighbor of course is the US and also a link to Canada through NAFTA.
*  Brazil doesn't quite have anything comparable. Chile is small and in some ways it's quite
*  distant. Is the correct inference that Mexico is part of this larger network will grow more
*  rapidly than Brazil? Well I mean I think there is some evidence
*  to suggest that you're more likely to copy useful institutions, social norms from nearby
*  neighbors. So there is a proximity effect. So that could result in both positive and
*  negative copyings. So yeah, I mean I think neighbors matter.
*  Your work on animals, we have a little time to talk about this. You've studied chimpanzees.
*  They're termite fishing. They're ant dipping. They're nut cracking. How conservative are
*  chimpanzees? How much is their chimpanzee culture in addition to their instincts?
*  Right, so chimps definitely have some culture. They do some social learning. They learn a
*  few tools. The key difference between other animals and humans is that human culture is
*  cumulative. So we're able to learn stuff from the previous generation, add a little bit
*  to it, pass it down to the next generation, add a little bit to it. And in chimps, because
*  of their social structure and in part maybe because of their cognition, they're not able
*  to generate this cumulative cultural evolution. So nothing that a chimp does, nothing that
*  he does he couldn't figure out by himself. So he might get it more easily by learning
*  it from another chimp. But nothing is so complex that he couldn't figure out by himself.
*  And in humans, even in the simplest human societies, hunter-gatherers, there's tons
*  of things that no single individual could figure out in their lifetime. And you're completely
*  dependent on this body of knowledge, know-how, norms that's bequeathed to you from prior
*  generations just to survive.
*  There's some breakthrough in the past that's quite remarkable. What are now human beings
*  that the other great apes don't? And this is all speculative, of course, but what in
*  your opinion is that confluence of events that leads to this great filter, what are
*  now human beings pass through it, but the other great apes basically do not?
*  Yeah, so that's the startup problem. And so the key thing to understand the startup problem
*  is how humans went up down this special trajectory. So the way I think about it is you want to
*  think about natural selection as investing either in bigger brains that make you better
*  at figuring out stuff out by yourself, better at individual learning, or better at cultural
*  learning, at learning from others. And when there's not very much interesting things,
*  interesting tools, techniques, ideas in the minds and behaviors of other members of your
*  social group, individual learning is better because learning from others doesn't get
*  you anything because nobody else in the group has anything. So what you need is a situation
*  where you're able to have useful ideas in the minds of other members of your social
*  group.
*  So in the book, I make the case that when humans are on the savanna as bipedal apes,
*  the predator guild was probably much larger. So humans have a chimpanzee-like brain except
*  they lived in larger groups, and they would have had to be more social with each other,
*  so there's a chance they could have crossed this threshold and started down this road.
*  There's a few other factors like the climate was changing in a way that would have favored
*  cultural evolution, so a few other things play into it, but that's the basic idea.
*  But it's not in a way there are not intermediate species, or maybe there were and we killed
*  them off, but like Neanderthals, Denisovans, might they have been smarter than humans?
*  Yeah, so in the book I make the case that Neanderthals were probably smarter than us
*  because in primates, basically its overall brain size predicts how good you are on various
*  cognitive tests. And Neanderthals are our cousins, so they're around, say, from 200,000
*  to 25,000, and they have larger brains than us. We're about 1350 cc's, Neanderthals are
*  1500, so we should expect them to be smarter than us. The difference is the African variant
*  were the African variant. We had larger groups because we were living in a climate that allowed
*  us to have a larger collective brain, so we were able to generate probably bows and arrows,
*  other fancy technologies, and then we move into Europe and exterminate the Neanderthals.
*  You're an anthropologist, you've spent a lot of time with economists, co-authored, worked
*  with Paul Romer, Colin Cameron, others. As an anthropologist, what do you find strange
*  about the tribe known as econ?
*  Yeah, so I had a real opportunity, I was very fortunate in my career to be a professor of
*  psychology and a professor of economics at the same time, but to be neither in some deep
*  sense. So I would get to go back and forth from seminars in economics and psychology.
*  In economics, there's this really competitive culture. So the way I like to describe it,
*  if you're giving a seminar in economics, the crowd, everybody's trying to show who's the
*  smartest guy in the room. And so just on your first slide, someone will raise their hand,
*  like, I haven't said anything yet. And then they'll try to ask the killer question, which
*  undercuts your whole talk so that you can get your way to the beginning. Whereas psychologists
*  will sit quietly, they watch your talk, you go through your whole PowerPoint, you probably
*  touch a lot of different research projects. And then there'll be question time and first
*  no hands will go up. And then someone will be like, I've got a question. And then they
*  say, I just have one small question. I mean, it was a great talk. And this is just a very
*  minor thing. And then they'll, they could be a killer question at that point when they've
*  done the preface. So it's a very strong cultural difference between the econ tribe and the
*  psychology tribe. I've always wanted to write an ethnography, my life among two strange
*  tribes, the psychologists and the economists.
*  And what's strange about the anthropologists?
*  That's a whole other thing. So that's the anthropology is a strange field because it's
*  split not down the middle, but about for 74% of the way through between the humanities
*  on one side, and then kind of evolutionary biologists on the other who call themselves
*  anthropologists. And so there's this science, anti science war that goes on within the same
*  department. So that's a whole other thing.
*  What I would call narrative or more subjective or interpretive anthropology. Does that have
*  a future in a world where everyone has access to audiences? People post anthropological
*  accounts on the internet every day. Some of them are quite wonderful. They're typically
*  by people with little or no training in anthropology. The world pays more attention to those on
*  average than to the writings of narrative anthropologists. Is there some kind of disconnect
*  here that the profession due to tenure is in one stage of its cultural evolution and
*  the rest of culture already has moved somewhere else?
*  That's possible. Although I mean, in my work, I've always tried to say that there's and
*  make the case and do that there's real value to ethnographic work, that you really learn
*  a lot and you get lots of ideas when you're in a village and you're living with the people,
*  you're working with them, you're eating their food, and you're just watching village life
*  go on. Some of my best ideas come when I'm in that situation. So I think there's great
*  value to doing this rich, deep ethnography, but we should combine it with the full set
*  of tools that the rest of the social science has to offer. So behavioral experiments, biometric
*  measures, fMRI, all this kinds of stuff.
*  If you were to name two or three thinkers and or books that were your main intellectual
*  inspirations, what would they be?
*  So I'm a big fan of Guns, Germs and Steel, Jared Diamond. I would also have to say Culture
*  on the Evolutionary Process, Boyden Richardson, 1985.
*  We have a copy of that here.
*  And I guess those are the main two. There's a book by Steve Frank called Foundations of
*  Sociality, which I really enjoyed as well.
*  And outside of your field, what's really influenced you?
*  Outside of my field? Well, I mean my undergraduate degree was aerospace engineering, or one of
*  my undergraduate degrees, and that gave me a real appreciation for a body of math and
*  a way of thinking that is very different from the field I went into, which was anthropology
*  at first. So I think I always had that kind of engineer in me, which might have led me
*  to think in ways different from your usual anthropologist.
*  And that's quite unusual for an anthropologist, correct?
*  I think so.
*  And it's unusual for an aerospace engineer, correct?
*  As far as I know, yeah.
*  When you originally became an aerospace engineer, what was the thought in your mind for doing
*  that and not anthropology or something?
*  Well, remember, I like Star Trek.
*  Sure, you like Star Trek.
*  Yeah, so I just wanted to, actually I wanted to do space propulsion. So when I was at the
*  end of my undergraduate, I was trying to decide if I wanted to go to grad school in
*  anthropology or study space propulsion. So I took a job, actually here in Northern Virginia,
*  and thought about it for a while. And then I decided, then I quit my job and drove to
*  California and became a grad student at UCLA.
*  If you've watched Star Trek and thought about space, let's say someday, whenever we encounter
*  intelligent aliens, how intelligible do you think they will be to us?
*  I wouldn't be very optimistic.
*  Wouldn't be very optimistic.
*  Because I can imagine an evolutionary track that is so different from anything we can
*  comprehend.
*  So they're not going to be like Vulcans and Romulans.
*  I don't think so.
*  They'll be a kind of pulsating mass mind and will never be able to translate into their
*  language. And we won't even be sure how smart they are for a long time.
*  Yeah. I think that seems like the most likely scenario.
*  And in your own work and in the social sciences, what are you currently most excited about?
*  Well, I'm most excited about this book, which I was partially describing. So I'm writing
*  a book on the weird people problem, on this question of how Westerners became psychologically
*  unusual. And that's taken me kind of deep dive into European history.
*  So that's what I'm working on now.
*  And it's you're mainly working on the historical side of that.
*  No. So I moved back and forth. So there's tons of experiments and lots of work from
*  economics actually, lots of work on institutions and culture from economics.
*  But I'm trying to weave that together where I move back and forth from the history.
*  So I might have some historical sequence, but I can't show the causality because I don't
*  have the data from history. But I can test the theory up here in the real world. And
*  then I go back to the history and move back and forth between those two.
*  And you're allowed to go back in time and visit one historical era as an anthropologist,
*  assuming you can speak the language and won't catch a disease. When and where would it be?
*  600 AD in Kent when the first missionaries arrived.
*  And what would you ask them?
*  Well, I'd observe them. I'd live among them.
*  Sure, you'd live among them.
*  But at some point you'd sit down.
*  So I want to find out. So I want to know the thing. I mean, we have some insights, but
*  what was the social structure at the time? How were people living? What was the real
*  political power of the chiefs? What were the missionaries really up to? We have a few letters
*  they sent back to the pope, but I'd want to get the whole story.
*  As to what life in Kent was like in the sixth century.
*  And what the missionaries were actually up to. Like, were they actually trying to ban
*  cousin marriage and all the stuff that they purported to do in their letters back to the
*  pope?
*  Joe, we look forward to your next book. His current book, The Secret of Our Success, will
*  be available for sale outside afterwards. We will move in just a second to question
*  and answer. We have microphones on each side, but before we do that, let's give Joe a big
*  round of applause.
*  Thank you.
*  For the questions, you are to ask questions to Joe. Not speeches. If you start a speech,
*  I will cut you off. This is question and answer, but mostly answer. Anyway, I will start over
*  here. Mark, first question.
*  So this is about cousin marriage. I'll try and be quick. So if it begins that the church
*  is undermining cousin marriage around 600, and then European economic success only really
*  takes off maybe a thousand years later, depending on what you think about the economic history,
*  is it plausible that the initial effects of undermining cousin marriage may have been
*  quite detrimental, like weakening social stability, making societies more fragmented?
*  Yes, absolutely. So the first thing that in order to get to individuals, you had to break
*  safety nets in the fabric of complex kinship societies, which were really fundamental to
*  how people were able to survive, and inheritance patterns had to be changed. So I would expect
*  things to get worse before they got better. I mean, it took a long time. It took centuries
*  for the church to alter these practices, and you don't get the emergence of, say, the first
*  charter towns where people are entering the towns as individuals until the 10th century
*  and then 11th century.
*  Next question.
*  I'm Mike Nelson. I work for an Internet company, so I have to ask an Internet question. I was
*  looking at your Twitter feed, and I noticed you don't tweet a lot, but some very interesting
*  things are in your feed, including an article by Jessica Tracy that you tweeted a month
*  and a half ago about how people don't like bullies, but society tends to give bullies
*  power. So my question is, do you believe that? Is it something you see in other societies?
*  Is there any advice you would give for dealing with online bullies who seem to be gaining
*  a lot of power and audience?
*  Right. Well, so Jess Tracy is a collaborator of mine. We were colleagues at the University
*  of British Columbia, and we did research on how different forms of status affect leadership.
*  We did a number of different studies. We worked with sports teams, and we also created groups
*  in the laboratory. What we found, both in the field and in the laboratory, is that individuals
*  who were given prestige, so who people thought were particularly skilled or particularly
*  knowledgeable in a certain area, had influence and were likely to become leaders in groups.
*  But we also found that individuals who were pushy, aggressive, and sometimes agonistic
*  could also find their way into leadership roles in groups. So that was the basis of
*  Jess's, I guess it was an op-ed in USA Today. So that's what she was writing about, and
*  it appears in our data, so the scientific process will move on. So tentatively, I do
*  think it's an important idea. I don't have any advice for the online bullies.
*  Next question.
*  Hey, I'm Cathy. I write about sex and politics. I was curious about if society got better,
*  more prosperous, more peaceful by making monogamous marriage a norm, by taking some extraneous
*  males out of society, then would it not follow that a social norm that has one female with
*  multiple husbands would be even better, because we've got pretty good evidence that extraneous
*  females are not particularly problematic to society, and it would help get rid of the
*  remaining extraneous males?
*  Right. So yeah, that's a great question. So here's the issue. So when I assemble this
*  argument, taking what we know about evolutionary biology and about kind of male-female differences,
*  and you very rarely see polyandrous societies. So in the anthropological record, about 0.3%
*  of human societies have polyandry, and those societies don't have lots of polyandry. They
*  have a sort of non-trivial proportion of polyandry. The elite males in those societies are still
*  often polygynous, and there's lots of monogamous marriage. And so from a fitness point of view,
*  males can create children with a number of different females simultaneously, so there's
*  a big advantage to polygyny. Females, there's no advantage to her from a fitness point of
*  view of having multiple husbands, because the husbands will invest in the children according
*  to the degree to which they see themselves as the father. And so if you have multiple
*  husbands and they're all having sex with the wife, then the degree to which they see themselves
*  as the father will get smaller. So she doesn't get any more investment in the children by
*  having multiple husbands. So she has no incentive to be the husbands, and the males aren't going
*  to like it. So it's only in certain ecological contexts where you really need two or more
*  males to run the households that you see this pop up. And the men are usually brothers,
*  which helps reduce the conflict of interest over paternity.
*  Next question.
*  Hi, I'm Tom. I'm a student here at Mason. You talked a little bit about, well, you talked
*  a lot about the role of gods in society, and you mentioned how having one big god creates
*  a bigger society, while other smaller gods, I think you said galvanizes cooperation in
*  local communities. So how does that sort of cultural evolution from these smaller gods
*  to the bigger god shape understandings of human dignity?
*  Now, that's a tough one. So tell me more about human dignity.
*  My gut reaction would be, oh, you're thinking everybody's, you know, we're all children
*  of God, whereas if I am paying tribute to the God of my city, I'm more akin to the people
*  in my city, but somebody else living elsewhere, they're completely different from me, and
*  I can't judge them by the same standards.
*  Right. Yeah, so some historians, this relates to some of my thinking and research and reading
*  about European history, have made the case that the kind of human universalism that we
*  see emerging in notions of human rights and stuff come in part from this notion that we're
*  all children of the same God, rather than each of our tribes or each of our clans having
*  its own independent gods. So you can see if you're in this mindset, it might be easier
*  to come up with the idea of individual rights or some kind of universalism. And you see
*  this, I mean, even in the awful things the Spanish were doing when they first arrived
*  in Mexico, the priests are having this debate and they're saying, you know, you've got
*  to treat these, you know, these are children of God, just like everybody else. Now, their
*  preferences got lost and Spanish political interests overwhelmed that situation, but
*  it was there. The debate was there.
*  Question here. There's been a decline in the number of languages spoken worldwide, as
*  a number of dialects in the languages that are spoken. From your cultural evolutionary
*  perspective, is that a benefit from the perspective of increased interconnectivity between the
*  people or is it a loss of cultural biodiversity?
*  So I mean, I would see it as a great loss because languages contain rich ideas about
*  the culture. When people learn languages, they may actually come to think about the
*  world differently. Languages contain all these kind of different things like the spatial
*  reference systems that I mentioned, different ways of partitioning up the group. And people
*  can be bilingual. So you don't have to necessarily impede communication. You can learn one language
*  that's traditional language that you speak with people in your community and also learn
*  a kind of lingua franca so you can speak to the wider world.
*  If I could just follow up on that, though. If we think the larger cultural units have
*  more rapid cultural evolution and they carry means better. And the second language is much
*  tougher. So you go to India, the percentage of people who really speak English well in
*  India, it's probably below 10%, would be my sense. And you say Denmark is in some ways
*  very well interconnected with the world. There's a real chance in workplaces Danish won't be
*  spoken 30 years from now. And English will be. It's already the case. I mean, shouldn't
*  you consistently at most margins favor the larger language groups? Either that or revise
*  your views as to the greater number of pieces having more rapid cultural evolution. It could
*  be if you have seven languages in your country, you have more poetic ideas and different frameworks.
*  Well I think when people use different languages, they can think about things in different ways.
*  And it will highlight different features of the problem. So I think it's still valuable.
*  I mean, I would encourage people to learn multiple languages. And as long as you start
*  young enough, we seem to be pretty good at it. And it may actually have some positive
*  cognitive effects. There's debate remains about that. So I think we should encourage
*  people to learn multiple languages. But if you're just like betting on countries, here's
*  a country with only one language, here's a country with five languages, which will be
*  more creative? I mean, what's your bet? Well, but I think it's unclear because if you have
*  multiple languages, you can potentially learn from people. So suppose you speak Spanish,
*  Mandarin, and English. Then you can search the web in three languages and you get access
*  to a much wider collective brain than if you can just read the English. So the extra languages
*  can actually expand the size of the collective brain.
*  Next question.
*  Hi, I'm David. To the extent that you think that human beings are hardwired to be tribalistic,
*  do you think that the modern world's cultures are strong and good enough to overcome the
*  effects of violence and tribalism and its negative effects?
*  Yeah, so my take on this is that we do have a tribal psychology and the key to building
*  nation states was actually to harness and religions was to harness this tribal instinct.
*  So one of the things nations do is try to create a uniform language because language
*  is one of the key cues that people use in figuring out what groups they're in. Establishing
*  other sort of similar cultural patterns and beliefs helps in establishing a nation. So
*  we talked about this idea that these things break down over time because it's hard to
*  maintain a large country in sufficiently culturally similar that you don't end up with different
*  tribes. So I think we're going to see what we've always seen, which is things break down.
*  Things fall apart and then they reform and they spread and they break down and they reform
*  and they spread.
*  Next question here.
*  Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm really curious about your thoughts on the maverick versus the cultural
*  learner and what you think today the role of the maverick is and it appears that culture
*  evolution shrunk the size of the number of mavericks needed to get us here. In other
*  words, we didn't need a lot of cultural pessimists and individual learners. We needed a lot of
*  people thinking alike and following the norms. The reason I'm so interested in that ratio
*  is as a career coach, all my clients are the maestros. They're all Mr. Cowens and they're
*  all in careers that their tribe picked for them. You see, they copied what worked for
*  the tribe. So my question is, what's the role of the maverick today? Do we still need some?
*  Does culture evolution need us? Where do we fit?
*  One thing that's interesting about the maverick question is we tend to think of the maverick
*  as the individual learner, the person who comes up with their own idea, their own new
*  idea. My take on the history, at least of invention, so that's something I've spent
*  a little bit of time on, could be different in other domains, is great ideas actually
*  come from a recombination. If you're a cultural learner and you learn a little bit from this
*  guy and a little bit from this guy and a little bit from that guy and recombine them, you
*  get a brand new thing, but you actually were just cultural learning from three different
*  people. So knowing people in very different domains of knowledge that normally don't meet
*  is a great way to be an innovator.
*  To follow up on that, in the 19th century Tocqueville wrote that Americans were among
*  the most conformist of people and it was precisely because they are free and that they could
*  be organized in mass numbers in a kind of larger market setting and you had a lot of
*  economies of scale. He thought that made us on average quite conformist. Do you agree
*  with that portrait?
*  I mean Americans had, well at least some of them had relatively similar cultural backgrounds.
*  I guess I don't know enough about the data at the time.
*  Next question.
*  Oh sorry, yes here.
*  In your observation of the attack mentality of economic seminars and adding to that the
*  observation that over my 50 years as an economist, the literature has changed completely so that
*  now every article in the journal begins, I construct a model which so that you can't
*  argue about the economics of it. One of the things that you might elaborate on, on how
*  this affects the evolution of things, when I started there were no schools of public
*  policy and now if you want to do the economy you go to a school of public policy. So can
*  you elaborate on how this kind of mentality of the internal discourse of various disciplines
*  might have affected where they've gone and what they do and who takes up what social
*  issues nowadays?
*  Yeah, I mean I don't know, I mean I tend to think of disciplines as, you know, they're
*  really cultures, right? Because you're training graduate students, they're being taught certain
*  what counts as evidence, what's a good project, what's a good paper, how do you do a presentation.
*  You mentioned anthropologists. Anthropologists read their papers so they stand up in the
*  front and just read it. I mean that's a quite different cultural style but in the case of
*  economics, I think it's strongly influenced by the need to run everything through individual
*  choice models. So everything's got to be a kind of utility function and I have a lot
*  of friends who they have an interesting empirical result but they rack their brains because
*  they've then got to make up some model that will produce that result in order to be able
*  to sell it to a top five economics journal. So I think that that's not completely healthy
*  and there should be, you know, there's lots of other ways of thinking about human decision
*  making, cognition, how it is people come to do what they do besides running everything
*  through a utility function. But, you know, it's a cultural tradition within the discipline.
*  Next question.
*  When Tyler asked you whether the US or Canada was weirder, I was surprised that you didn't
*  mention the American obsession with American football and baseball. I'm curious, in any
*  of your books have you explored how sport affects culture and culture affects sport
*  and have you read the book How Soccer Explains the World?
*  No, I haven't read How Soccer Explains the World. I mean I do think sport is potentially
*  a great cultural technology for bringing people together because they all get together
*  to watch the event and they, you know, you have high emotions and I mean I think it can
*  be a neat cultural technology. I haven't gotten into it beyond that but it seems like
*  a good candidate. That's one of those things where I'd say maybe there's more to it than
*  just a happy pastime, you know, it might have some deeper social function.
*  Next question. Michael?
*  You write a lot about prestige. I'm interested in lack of prestige and the effect on us,
*  particularly men, and what behavior that may cause.
*  Right. So you're thinking that when males don't achieve very much prestige, how that
*  affects them?
*  Right. So there's a lot of copying and mimicry amongst, you know, people, you know, who are
*  prestigious, you know, or if you're prestigious, so I'll mimic you. But what if, you know,
*  a person who lacks prestige, you know, there's a phrase that I've come across recently called,
*  you know, damage masculinity. Like what would happen to those people in their little tribes
*  or whatever and what would that cause them potentially to do?
*  Well one of the things that comes up in the polygyny research is when you have high rates
*  of polygyny, you get this group of low status males and in order to increase their status,
*  they have to take big risks. So they go into a mindset where they're willing to do anything
*  that will allow them to hop up into the higher status states. So you might get, when you
*  get really low status males, you might get lots more, a lot more risk taking, steep temporal
*  discounting, a psychological shift that gives you a chance to possibly climb the status
*  hierarchy because if you determine I'm not going anywhere unless I, you know, do something
*  in order to get into that higher status. So I think there's some evidence out there for
*  that.
*  Next question.
*  So I was thinking with the example of the monks going into, or the missionaries going
*  into different tribal situations, or just even with cultural evolution in general, to
*  what extent do the established norms try to punish difference?
*  Well yeah, I mean that's part of the story. So cultural norms, part of being a cultural
*  norm is to say that if you deviate from it, people are going to be annoyed with you in
*  some way. So there's going to be some kind of punishment or sanctioning, you know, people
*  won't marry you, all kinds of things like that. So that's what creates kind of the stability.
*  And then the question is, if you've got this stabilizing social, set of social behaviors,
*  how do you change that? So if it's not a very good social norm, not very efficient or prosocial,
*  how do you change that? And this intergroup competition is one of the possible ways of
*  changing that. So if groups are copying more successful groups, then they'll tend to copy
*  norms that are more prosocial, lead to success in intergroup competition relative to the
*  others. Did that get at your question?
*  I guess I was thinking, you know, it's like how do the missionaries, these sort of outsiders
*  coming in, you know, how does that culture sort of quote unquote win out?
*  Oh I see, okay, yeah. Okay, great.
*  I don't think of it in zero-sum terms, but.
*  So yeah, so both from my own experience and from reading, the way Protestant missionaries
*  operate in South America is that they show up with radios, steel tools, and antibiotics.
*  So right away they seem like a more successful group, so they're able to influence people.
*  And especially the key with the Machiganga was getting the children. So the parents begin
*  coming to services and stuff in order to get the cooking oil and the machetes and stuff.
*  But then the children are experiencing the religion while growing up and then they're
*  believers even when their parents weren't.
*  And just tell us who the Machiganga are.
*  Oh so this is this group I worked with in the Peruvian Amazon. Traditional, small scale,
*  lived in single families scattered throughout the forest. And I spent a few months paddling
*  around in a dugout trying to learn about their society.
*  Question over here.
*  Hi. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about China, because I personally
*  think China is a pretty successful society just because there are so many Chinese people
*  in the world and they have not had a single god or just any comments you might have on
*  them.
*  Yeah, so in our religion project, we've actually brought a bunch of historians of China into
*  the project. And there seems to be quite a bit of debate in the field about whether there
*  were high gods in ancient China. So there's certainly textual evidence from the Warring
*  States period suggesting there were big high gods and people were very concerned with getting
*  the mandate of heaven. So at least based on that evidence, there actually may have been
*  high gods during at least the early period of Chinese history. And now there's lots of
*  ancestor gods and other kinds of supernatural agents. Buddhism made a brief appearance before
*  it got stomped out by the Chinese state. So it's a more complicated religious picture.
*  Question.
*  Do you think that modern cultural evolution, at least in the U.S., is making people more
*  individualistic and selfish, or do you think it's leading to a more collectivist society?
*  Yeah, I think that individualism is still increasing, certainly I think in the last
*  50 years or so. So I mean, we now have psychological measures, for example, conformity, showing
*  that Americans have gotten less conformist over the last 50 years. So yeah, greater individualism,
*  more concern with self, more concern with personal achievements. Self-enhancement is
*  the psychological term, trying to make yourself look good.
*  Last question.
*  What proportion of the variation in cooperation, let's say, in a prisoner's dilemma would you
*  attribute to, would you say is phenotypic versus cultural? And I ask because you seemed
*  very much on the side of culture earlier in the talk, but then your comment about the
*  adoption of missionary religion seems to suggest that culture is much more mutable than something
*  like the persistence of cooperation over many generations could explain, or could be explained
*  by.
*  So thinking about phenotype, so we have evidence from twin studies in Sweden and the U.S. suggesting
*  that about half of the variation, say behavioral economic gains, is explained by genes. Now
*  there's no reason to think that that actually extends to other populations. So for example,
*  the kind of variation you would get in something like the ultimatum game, which is a standard
*  behavioral economics game, you don't even get that kind of variation in the smallest
*  scale human societies. People just, you know, they always accept offers in the ultimatum
*  game. So it's pretty hard to make an estimate of the different contributions from genes
*  and culture. I think for explaining most of these things, you want to recognize that we
*  have an evolved psychology that allows us to acquire social norms. And what you're really
*  trying to figure out is what social norms people are mapping onto the experiments or
*  to the situation and how those social norms vary across societies. So I would start by
*  trying to explain the variation in social norms across societies.
*  Two announcements. There will be a book sale and signing outside. The Secret of Our Success,
*  Joe's book, a great book. Also the next event, December 5th, Jhumpa Lahiri, the author. I
*  will be having a conversation with her. Let's give a big round of applause for Joe.
