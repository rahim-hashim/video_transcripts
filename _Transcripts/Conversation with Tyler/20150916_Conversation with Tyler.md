# Luigi Zingales on Italy, Google and Conglomeration, and Donald Trump  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [September 16, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7DU5f0GZ9E)
*  Luigi Zingales, my conversant, is one of the best and best-known economists, both in the
*  United States and in Europe.
*  He's written three best-selling books, the most recent of which just came out in Italian.
*  It's called Europe or No.
*  A Capitalism for the People from three years ago is, in my view, perhaps the best book
*  on the current American economy and what's wrong with it and what should be done.
*  And with Raghu Rajan, he has an earlier book, Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists.
*  Luigi's contributions are far-ranging.
*  He's been at the Graduate School of Business of University of Chicago for now, I think,
*  27 years.
*  He is a major contributor to theory of the firm, politics, culture, governance.
*  This is just a small sliver of the papers he has written in addition to the three books.
*  He is now the director of the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago.
*  Most of all, in recent times, Luigi has been known for his biting critique of what we all
*  sometimes call crony capitalism.
*  There's more I could say, but let's get to the dialogue.
*  Now, I think a lot of your work is bringing the ideas of culture and governance into economics.
*  And there's a few major strands in your thought, and I want to explore a few of them.
*  Since you're Italian, let's start with the question of Italy.
*  If you look at the economic performance of Italy, the country is just coming out of a
*  triple dip recession, right?
*  Unemployment is about 12%.
*  By some measures, I've seen per capita income is not higher than what it was 15 years ago,
*  and there are over 2 trillion euros in debt.
*  Some serious problems and a low birth rate.
*  How do you see this playing itself out, and what is the end game?
*  How pessimistic or optimistic are you?
*  I think that you said correctly, it's not just the fact we're coming out from a triple
*  recession, it's the fact that Italy did not grow for the last 20 years.
*  There are a lot of things that don't go well in Italy, but when I left it 27 years ago,
*  a lot of things were not working, and Italy was growing.
*  In fact, in the period 1945 to 1995, Italy grew at a rate that was at least as good,
*  if not better, than Europe and the United States, and especially in terms of productivity.
*  Since 1995, Italy stopped growing in terms of productivity, and of course, if you don't
*  grow in terms of productivity, don't grow in terms of income per capita, and so on and
*  so forth.
*  The question of why, I think, is one of the most important questions, not just for the
*  future of Italy, but for the future of Europe in general.
*  With a co-author, I tried to analyze the values theories, because one theory which is very
*  popular, particularly in Italy, is that it's all fault of the euro, because it is true
*  that this sort of sudden stop happened roughly at the time Italy joined the euro.
*  I don't think there is any evidence that that's the case, in spite of the fact that there
*  is a strong correlation, temporarily.
*  I think that the sad reality is that the institutional deficit present in Italy are particularly
*  severe as you approach the technological frontier.
*  If you have institutions that don't work, that are corrupt, and etc., you can get by
*  the only thing you have to do is improve agriculture and produce t-shirts.
*  We've seen sort of Cambodia, not a great institution, but they produce great t-shirts, and it works.
*  Once you try to compete in the first league, you want to try to be at the frontier of the
*  You need to have a relatively non-corrupt government, a system where people pay taxes without too
*  much tax evasion, but not too much taxes, because otherwise they don't produce, and
*  so on and so forth.
*  Italy has failed, in my view, to do that.
*  I think that the new government by Renzi is trying to do this.
*  The Jew is still out whether it will succeed.
*  When I hear other people speak about Italy, there's a certain tension as to how long these
*  cultural effects last.
*  You read Robert Putnam.
*  Things matter from hundreds of years ago.
*  In some of your papers, it matters how many years a region had as an independent city
*  state.
*  It matters whether, I think in the year 1000, whether you had a medieval bishop in your
*  city.
*  Those are very durable cultural effects.
*  I think back to being in Italy in the mid-1980s, when it passed the UK in terms of per capita
*  income.
*  It was, in a sense, then at the European frontier and still growing.
*  Now it's not so much later, and what feels like the same culture seems to be giving very
*  different results.
*  How's the way we make sense of that?
*  Two things.
*  First of all, the distinction that Putnam makes and a lot of people make about the North
*  and the South.
*  I think in some senses, disappearing in Italy, but in the worst direction, since all Italy
*  is looking more like the South.
*  The Northern people, and I come from the North, even if my grandfather came from the South,
*  but I came from the North, and people in the North, when I go back home, they still feel
*  like very proud that they're much better than people in the South.
*  When you're in the Titanic, being on the third deck or the first deck doesn't make a huge
*  difference.
*  You are on the third deck is better than the first, because you just sink a little bit
*  later, but you still sink.
*  I think that there is this arrogance in the North that I don't think is fully justified,
*  because many of the bad practices of the South have been imported to the North.
*  The mafia used to be only in Sicily.
*  Today is present in Milan, is present in Venice, is present everywhere.
*  I think that when we are questioning what is that, I think there is this component.
*  The second is the boom, what people did not fully realize, but the boom of Italy in the
*  1980s was a boom of a developing country that had a protected currency area.
*  We were playing the catch-up nation within Europe.
*  Everybody else in Europe was moving in more advanced production and services, etc.
*  They were leaving behind market space for us to capture the less technological productions,
*  and we did it with gusto.
*  It was a boom in the 80s, but it was a boom in the wrong direction.
*  Say we go back to 1860.
*  Was Verdi wrong?
*  Say Italy had not become a single nation.
*  There had been a North and a South, or even half a dozen or more nations competing against
*  each other, or more of a Swiss model.
*  Was the nationalist model for Italy a mistake?
*  This is a very hard question, but let me try to say that what I think was wrong is precipitating
*  the unification without really a national culture.
*  Italy was a small elite that felt Italian, but the rest of the population did not feel
*  Italian.
*  A number of accidents, including the aroism of the only Italian who was a military leader,
*  Garibaldi, made unification possible against all odds.
*  I'm sure that you asked people in 1858, what are the chances that within three decades
*  Italy would get unified?
*  They would say one out of a hundred, and within two years was unified most of it.
*  So it was really a chance, but then because this happened before there was a national
*  spirit, it turned out it was basically an agonization of the South by the North, in
*  which the North imposed its laws to the South, and they were not good for the South.
*  One of the best Italian thinkers and most unknown is this guy Vincenzo Cuoco, who was
*  part of the Neapolitan Revolution in 1799 and was actually convicted to death to participate
*  in this revolution.
*  This revolution, for people who are not familiar with Italian history, was a Jacobin revolution
*  trying to imitate what they were doing in Paris in Naples.
*  This revolution initially succeeded, and then a cardinal brought some troops from the South
*  of a very simple peasant that massacred the Neapolitan elite and brought back the Ancien
*  regime.
*  Then they of course went back and forth with Murat, etc.
*  The interesting thing about this guy is that after he was convicted to death and then got
*  escaped, wrote a history about that revolution.
*  He's probably the only person who wrote a history of something that he lived in and
*  gave an interpretation that is valid to this day.
*  His interpretation is you can't export other models in different contexts.
*  The Neapolitans who tried to copy France are silly because they don't understand the social,
*  cultural, economic context of France at that time was completely different than one of
*  Naples.
*  Here's this analogy, say every place has its own clothes.
*  You are not going to put Finnish clothes to a Greek or Greek clothes to a Finnish because
*  you're going to either sweat to death or be freezing.
*  Why do you want to impose the same rules to everybody?
*  Italy tried to do this, and the result was that in the South a complete rejection of
*  the Northern model, so much so that there was a revolt that we in history called bandits,
*  but in reality was a liberation front that just lost.
*  When you lose you're always on the wrong side and so it's called bandits.
*  The North did not need this.
*  The South had this revolt and then they reached a compromise that was a compromise not unlike
*  I think what happened in the South and the United States.
*  It was for the wars of both sides in the sense that the North side agreed with the big land
*  that will leave them in power in exchange for consensus and they will retain their power
*  in exchange for an army that defends their land against the revolt of the people.
*  That led the South to underdevelopment for years.
*  Very few people know that when Italy got unified the Inca per capita of Sicily and the one
*  of Emilia-Romagna around Bologna were the same.
*  Today it's almost double the one of Emilia-Romagna versus Sicily.
*  So it's a huge sort of gap.
*  Now why I insist so much on this because I think there is an analogy that most people
*  don't fully appreciate between the Italian unification and the European unification.
*  Europe got unified roughly in the same way.
*  There was a small elite that felt European.
*  Most people don't really feel European but a small elite feel European.
*  They speak the same language which happens to be English.
*  Pretty soon England would be out of Europe but they feel part of the same nation.
*  They talk, they go to the same meetings, etc. etc.
*  And they're trying to force unification over the desire of people and the result I think
*  is not working very well.
*  And in the old days you were sending troops to maintain the south.
*  Under order now you use the central bank or you use sort of a...
*  But it's not that different.
*  At the end of the day what I fear is a desertification of the southern part of Europe similar to
*  what happened in the southern part of Italy.
*  Like a deindustrialization.
*  One of my favorite papers by you is your paper with Bruno Pellegrino.
*  It's a great name for co-authoring a paper on Italy.
*  The way I read that paper is you're saying something like this.
*  Italy right now doesn't have enough firms which could be five or ten times larger than
*  they currently are.
*  And the global economy over the last 20 years has put greater emphasis on scaling up.
*  The 1980s were much less about scaling up.
*  You could do better with small to medium size enterprises in the 1980s.
*  But now everything's about scaling up.
*  You have Apple, you have Google, kind of mega scale.
*  So Italy more or less has stayed still.
*  China has scaled up.
*  And in the new world where scaling up is really what matters, Italy is left behind.
*  And that's the fundamental productivity reason why even the Italian north hasn't in some
*  ways done that well.
*  Is that the way you think about it?
*  Absolutely.
*  But it's not just the Apple of this world.
*  It's also the Starbucks.
*  If there is one thing Italy is competitive on and is better than everybody else, it's
*  food.
*  Okay?
*  And the fact that the major chain of coffee is not Italian is really hurtful.
*  And it's just I understand that Apple is an American product.
*  But when I arrived in this country 27 years ago, you're not really drinking coffee.
*  You're drinking like a dark thing that tastes like I don't say what because we're online.
*  So the culture of coffee did not exist here.
*  And the culture of coffee and a cafe where you sort of sit and drink, et cetera, what
*  Starbucks is, is Italian or at most French culture.
*  And why you were unable to export this?
*  And this is my little explanation.
*  If you go to an Italian coffee, by the way, the only country in the world where Starbucks
*  has not arrived is Italy.
*  So if you go to an Italian coffee shop, the productivity of the individual working there
*  is five times the one of Starbucks.
*  They do coffee, cappuccino, one after the other, no question asked.
*  They understand five orders contemporaneously.
*  You come here to the United States.
*  You first go to the cashier.
*  You have to repeat five times what you want.
*  Then another repeat five times to the one producing it and then five times to the one
*  delivering it.
*  It's sort of, how can Starbucks compete?
*  And the answer is very simple because the bar, the Italian cafe are one shop, one establishment
*  thing.
*  If you go to a cafe, you're going to find that at the register there is an old woman
*  who is generally the owner.
*  And she watches over everything.
*  Why?
*  So you can't steal monitoring.
*  Exactly.
*  But why?
*  Because the model they're doing allows people to steal whatever they want because you take
*  money here.
*  You use coffee all over the place.
*  You have no monitoring of how much coffee is consumed, how much revenue I produce.
*  If you don't have the lady checking you out throughout the day, at the end of the day,
*  there's zero revenues and all costs.
*  In Starbucks, everything is computerized.
*  So you know at the end of the day how many coffee you have to have and how much revenue
*  you have to have, how much coffee you have consumed.
*  You can actually order coffee online automatically because everything is centralized in Seattle.
*  So you can scale it.
*  So in the extreme agency problems of Italy, it makes it difficult to scale firms.
*  So either you have family firms in which you have all the employees that are part of the
*  family and it's not obvious that family does not steal, but still less so.
*  At least they're stealing from themselves.
*  Exactly.
*  At least there is some redistribution internally.
*  Or at the end of the day, you can scale this thing up.
*  I think that's a huge problem.
*  Here's an article from Quartz.
*  Let me read you the headline.
*  Maybe you saw it from a few months ago.
*  The most common surnames of new entrepreneurs in Italy are Hu, Hu, Chen, and Sing.
*  And if you look at Milan, you have to go through 20 names.
*  And at number 20 is the Italian name Colombo for the most common or most frequent names
*  of entrepreneurs.
*  Is this sustainable culturally or is this Italy's future?
*  In essence, to be economically colonized the way parts of Southeast Asia have been
*  by Chinese, Indians, Sikhs, whoever it may be.
*  Maybe Germans.
*  So one friend of mine was saying that the demise of the Italian firm family structure
*  is the demise of the Italian family.
*  And it says, when you used to have seven kids, one out of seven in the family was smart.
*  You could find them.
*  Right?
*  You could transfer the business within the family with a little bit of may talkers in
*  selection.
*  When you're down to one or two kids, the chances are one is an idiot and it's pretty large.
*  And so the result is that you can't really transfer the business within the family.
*  So the biggest problem of Italy is actually fertility, in my view.
*  Because we don't have enough kids.
*  And if you don't have enough kids, you don't have enough people to transfer.
*  You don't have enough young people to be dynamic.
*  So the Italian culture has a lot of defects, but the entrepreneurship culture was there,
*  has been there, and it still is there.
*  But we don't have enough young people.
*  And now what the Chinese are doing are taking over mostly sort of the bars, the restaurants,
*  the small things initially, because those are the easy ones to enter.
*  And there are many and they're very dynamic.
*  And so I think that that's exactly the Italian problem.
*  So paint a picture for me here of the end game.
*  Thirty years from now, typical Italian family has 1.3 kids, debt to GDP ratio at least is
*  reported at about 130%, second highest in the Eurozone after Greece, productivity problems.
*  Thirty years from now, what do you predict?
*  What are we going to see?
*  You know, it's difficult to predict, especially in the future.
*  I think that my view is one thing I can predict fairly confidently is that we are not going
*  to pay the debt.
*  So there will be some form of external redistribution.
*  Now unfortunately, we missed the right moment.
*  There was a moment in which 50% of the debt was owned by foreigners.
*  And the Germans made sure that we bought it all back.
*  That was part of the system.
*  And now I think it's 70% owned by Italians, so it's mostly redistribution.
*  But I think that it's very hard to imagine that we can sustain this level of debt.
*  I think that the combination between lack of fertility, lack of productivity growth,
*  and not particularly lawful immigration makes demography being the number one consideration.
*  And I've said this like 10 years ago.
*  And of course, nobody wants to talk about these things, but it's inevitable.
*  Let me try giving you an optimistic case for Italy, and you tell me if you buy it or not.
*  If you look at debt to income for Italy, it does look horrible.
*  It is horrible.
*  But if you look at debt to wealth of the eurozone nations, the ratio of wealth to income in Italy is quite high.
*  As you know, a very high percentage of Italian families simply own their houses outright.
*  Private debt is pretty low, right?
*  Traditionally, a lot of the banks have been in okay shape.
*  So it could be when you think about Italian debt relative to wealth, it's only an extraction or a political economy problem.
*  Who is going to pay?
*  Who is going to pick up the bill on the table of the restaurant?
*  Of course, all the Italians are waiting.
*  But when the time comes and things are truly desperate, Italy has often done best in desperate times,
*  and the wealth is there to pay off the debt.
*  Everyone's simply playing a postponing game.
*  True or false?
*  I think it's false.
*  The only thing that I agree is that the Italians give the best in the worst times.
*  I think that that's definitely the case.
*  However, I'm surprised that you don't think there are significant that way cost of taxation and with distribution.
*  So and especially within a more mobile world, this is becoming very serious.
*  You mentioned correctly houses, though that's the only stuff that cannot run away.
*  People run away.
*  Financial capital runs away.
*  Houses don't run away.
*  Okay.
*  So first of all, Italians are taxed very little on houses today.
*  And the first decision that Renzi has made is to de-tax houses completely.
*  Yes, I know.
*  So it's going completely in the wrong direction.
*  Okay.
*  Why?
*  Because it's extremely unpopular.
*  Of course.
*  If 70% of people own houses, then it's hard to tax houses.
*  And honestly, if you were to do a wealth tax on houses, the value of houses would go down
*  because people are very illiquid and so it would go down.
*  Now, how can you tax a lot other stuff?
*  Labor leaves.
*  I'm an example of that.
*  And unfortunately, there is an increasing number of people leaving.
*  So when I left Italy, very few people were leaving at that time.
*  Today, it's hard to find people of the younger generation not leaving.
*  It's really sort of a major migration that, by the way, decreased the human capital.
*  Because now who are leaving?
*  Italy is in the business of exporting high human capital people and importing low human
*  capital people.
*  So it's not a good trade.
*  And as long as you are in the European Union, even financial mobility is high.
*  It's like saying, unfortunately, I always choose the wrong places because I live in
*  Illinois.
*  Illinois is not that different from Italy.
*  Chicago.
*  Exactly.
*  So in fact, I always say that the thing that makes me feel at home in Illinois is Chicago
*  politics.
*  So if you try to fix the Illinois budget, et cetera, it's very hard to increase taxes
*  because people move to Indiana or Michigan or Wisconsin in a second.
*  We can discuss how big is the Laffer curve at the national level, but at the state level
*  is very elastic.
*  And it used to be that in Italy was not the case.
*  But what the European Union has done is to basically eliminate this bias.
*  And people, I grew up in Veneto, which is not far from Austria and Slovenia.
*  People move to Austria and Slovenia anytime.
*  And why do you want to stay in Italy where you're taxed more, things work less well,
*  et cetera, et cetera?
*  So the elasticity is very large.
*  And so if you try to catch up in that game, I think that you're going to lose.
*  Let's try the United States for a while.
*  A lot of us have been very struck by a piece you wrote in 2011.
*  I think it was for City Journal.
*  And this was a piece about Donald Trump.
*  And you basically said in this piece, Donald Trump is for real or could be for real.
*  We should be very grateful that he has decided not to run for president.
*  This is 2011, not 2015.
*  Now you're Italian, a quarter Sicilian, I'm told.
*  And you've lived here now, not here, you've lived in Illinois for 27 years.
*  What is it you see about us that we don't?
*  You're kind of Tocqueville of Italy.
*  A lot of your papers are on the United States.
*  What's the insight into us that you get and we lack?
*  Let me start with the analogy between Trump and Berlusconi.
*  Because I think that they are very similar in every dimension.
*  In a sense, they're both extremely good salesmen.
*  They're both extremely wealthy and not afraid to show off their wealth.
*  They're both obsessed with women.
*  They're both obsessed with air or lack of air for Berlusconi.
*  They both profess themselves as free marketeers.
*  But they both made their money in businesses that are the ultimate
*  opposite of free markets.
*  This is real estate and gambling versus real estate and
*  TV that is basically a regulated utility in Italy.
*  This sort of, you make money by having the right connection with government.
*  And so that's their version of free market.
*  But they're both extremely good, and this is the success of Berlusconi and
*  the success of Trump, in portraying themselves as friends of the people.
*  Why? In part is because they speak at a very low level.
*  So people identify with them and they are happy to identify because say,
*  even somebody that is so sort of crass like Berlusconi can become rich.
*  Maybe I can make it too.
*  So self-identification is very important.
*  But the most important thing, and this is coming to my advantage,
*  having seen what Berlusconi represented for Italy,
*  I became much more concerned about what the United States are becoming.
*  So my favorite line is that the great contribution of Berlusconi to humankind
*  is that made things transparent.
*  So Berlusconi is the integrated version of the US Congress.
*  In what sense?
*  In the US Congress, you have people that were lobbyists before.
*  They become congressmen, and then they go back to lobby.
*  But at least until they're congressmen or secretary or
*  treasurer, etc., they are not employees of somebody.
*  Now, they are beholden to somebody because they come there, they go there, but
*  at the moment, there's a little bit of appearance of separation.
*  Berlusconi did not even care about the appearance, okay?
*  Everything was integrated, his own employee.
*  So he ran a party with his own employee.
*  He created the party, it was fantastic.
*  From a strategic point of view, in three months, he created the party.
*  And he was sending his ad agent guy being the party leaders all over the place.
*  The same people became then his member of parliament.
*  The other were his personal lawyer, his personal something else, and so on.
*  They became sort of a member of parliament, ministries.
*  So you had the means of telecommunication that was the employee of Berlusconi
*  deciding on rules on telecommunication that affected Berlusconi.
*  So are you saying that we here are more corrupt than we think?
*  And that Berlusconi is a kind of mirror on us, and
*  you have better access to that mirror, and so through that mirror,
*  you understand America and its crony capitalism in some ways better than we do?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  One thing that strikes me about the literature on corruption and
*  rent seeking and political influence is what is sometimes here called the Tullock paradox.
*  Gordon Tullock worked in this building.
*  And Tullock raised the question of given how much is at stake in politics.
*  In the US it's about 40% of GDP.
*  In Europe it may be about 50% of GDP.
*  Tullock was actually surprised in a way relative to that.
*  How little was spent on lobbying.
*  So for him there's some kind of structural barrier story.
*  But what's your take on the Tullock paradox?
*  Why aren't we even more corrupt yet?
*  Given what percent of GDP in this country is allocated through mechanisms of a mix
*  of force and democratic, whatever you want to call it, rather than voluntary exchange.
*  Yeah, first of all, let me spend a while to praise Gordon Tullock.
*  They saw he passed away recently, and I'm even more sorry that he wasn't celebrated
*  in the way he deserved to be celebrated.
*  In my view, he was an extremely insightful economist who made the point of there is
*  not enough money in politics in 1972, if I'm not mistaken.
*  Long time ago, yeah.
*  Long time ago.
*  At a time where there was much less money in politics.
*  So first of all, he got clearly the derivative right because from 1972 to today,
*  the amount of money in politics exploded.
*  So I think he was very farsighted in understanding this.
*  The second is, in my view, the reason why we don't see enough money is twofold.
*  Number one, there is ideology.
*  So you can't really pay everybody, but people have some preferences,
*  especially when they're not paid a lot, for some position.
*  And so that decreases the power of money.
*  But the most important fact is that some people find it very easy to collect
*  the money, which are vested interests.
*  They organize because they're small.
*  This is Manco Olson.
*  They organize much faster.
*  They can collect the money faster.
*  In the public at large, finding it difficult to collect the money.
*  So the paradox of Taloc, the way I like to describe the Taloc paradox is the following.
*  Imagine you have some lottery tickets in which, unlike most lottery,
*  which the state gets most of it, is pure sort of actuarially fair.
*  So you know that you are going to buy, let's say, $5 trillion is the payoff.
*  And you start to sell the tickets.
*  You know that by buying all the tickets, for sure, you're going to get $5 trillion.
*  So it seems that why the collective amount of tickets doesn't sell for $5 trillion.
*  Sure.
*  And that's basically what Taloc is saying.
*  He's saying why if we are purely cynical and we try to buy all the votes,
*  if you buy all the votes in Congress and for president, you get to allocate a lot of goodies.
*  So the value of the votes collected should be at least the value of the rents you get
*  and all the goodies you allocate, which we can discuss how much it is.
*  But it's on the order of trillions of dollars.
*  So the point is that the public at large is not able to coordinate and bid very much for
*  those votes.
*  So those votes sell cheap.
*  Why they sell cheap?
*  Because the party are not well organized.
*  Now, since the time of Gordon Taloc to today, people got more and more organized.
*  And so the price is going up.
*  But there is way to go.
*  If we don't do something, there is way to go and spend more.
*  So I think that Gordon Taloc is absolutely right.
*  But the interesting thing is that Gordon Taloc implicitly, because the type of game he
*  designed for this, is a game in which there is a benefit for society to put some limits.
*  And I actually enjoy in my book to pick a little bit on Robert Barrow, because Robert
*  Barrow defends restrictions in basketball and baseball, but not in everywhere else in
*  the United States.
*  So I don't understand why in the United States, the only thing that is really non-competitive
*  is sport.
*  In Europe, the only thing that is really competitive is sport.
*  In Italy, soccer, you are the first division, the second division.
*  You are promoted or demoted according to performance.
*  You don't buy your way into the NFL or the major league, et cetera.
*  Here, you buy the franchise.
*  Once you're in, no matter how sort of incompetent you are, you stay there, which is completely
*  un-American.
*  I'm very struck by your early work on Business
*  Firms and Hierarchy.
*  Some of this is written with Rag√π.
*  And the idea of introducing or reintroducing ideas of culture and governance and hierarchy
*  into the business firm.
*  And I wonder sometimes how much is this an Italian perspective.
*  I'm sure you know Luigi Barzini's analysis of the multiplicity of masks in Italy.
*  And sometimes the outsiders who think it's so freewheeling overlook these significant
*  elements of hierarchy.
*  Now the question I want to ask you is, these recent New York Times articles about Amazon
*  and how Amazon either treated or allegedly treated its employees.
*  The woman took off a day to give birth to a child.
*  The next day she was expected to come back in.
*  All kinds of demands.
*  People supposedly left the company crying.
*  A lot of hierarchy.
*  Pay was pretty good.
*  But given your analysis of the Business Firm and Hierarchy, what's your take on this whole
*  Amazon story?
*  You think Amazon, those people are heroes or this is inhumane or we have the balance
*  wrong?
*  What do you say?
*  I think that probably we're going a bit too much in a certain direction.
*  Take also Netflix.
*  Apparently Netflix is sort of has this credo that we are a team, not a family.
*  And like a team, we sort of set aside everybody who sort of is not up to being a leader.
*  And it works very well to motivate people.
*  It's also quite sort of hard for many other people to work.
*  There is always the tradeoff between incentive and some form of insurance.
*  And if you eliminate every insurance, you have all incentives.
*  The incentives are great, but people are not particularly happy.
*  So you need to find the right tradeoff.
*  Maybe it's how we get these scalable firms in the U.S. that Italy is somewhat lacking.
*  I think that I always said that the perfect world is a world in which you take the best
*  things from Italy and the best things from the United States.
*  My dream would be to live in Italy and walk in the States.
*  The commuting is a bit complicated.
*  I think that you're absolutely right.
*  I think that I come from a region in Italy where there are a lot of family firms.
*  And what is extremely moving and depressing in this moment is in these firms, when they
*  go bankrupt, the owners commit suicide.
*  There is a pretty large number of suicides today because unfortunately the business is
*  not doing well.
*  And sometimes they leave their life insurance to pay the salary of the employees.
*  And then they commit suicide.
*  That's a completely orthogonal view of the firm, like really a family.
*  And now which one is better depends on a lot of things.
*  It depends on how much is important to transfer knowledge within the family.
*  So Italian firms are specialized, or used to be specialized, in craftsmanship that is
*  hard to teach unless you have a dedicated person transferring this.
*  That's the reason why there were family firms, because you have the parents transfer to the
*  kids.
*  A lot of the education in Italy is done in the family.
*  One of the best things about Italians, for example, is that they sit down at dinner.
*  They say, why so important?
*  I thought that this was everybody sit down at dinner with a family.
*  I realized in America a lot of people don't sit down at dinner.
*  Actually, when I grew up I sit down at lunch and dinner.
*  Today is difficult because most people are not around at lunch.
*  But there is a tradition of spending some time around the dinner table.
*  That's a place where you socialize, you learn, you transfer human capital from the older
*  generation to the younger generation.
*  I think that this is one thing that is lacking in the United States that they can learn from
*  Italy.
*  You've written on conglomerates.
*  One of the recent business stories is that Google will turn itself into a kind of conglomerate.
*  The parent firm will be called Alphabet.
*  Google will be one division.
*  Will this matter?
*  And if so, how?
*  I think it's not a bad idea for Google to separate the money-making machine from the
*  rest.
*  Why?
*  Because when you don't see how much transfer takes place, you tend to overdo it.
*  I think it's the first step to do this separation so that you see from an accounting point of
*  view who is making money and who is investing money or wasting money, depending on the point
*  of view.
*  Is it more innovation by imposing more accountability or do you think it's the opposite?
*  I think that if innovation were just throwing money at it, Greece would be the most innovative
*  country in the world.
*  Money is a necessary condition, but sometimes it's not actually all the time it's not sufficient
*  and sometimes it's also counterproductive.
*  I heard some young entrepreneurs saying, look, you don't want to get too much money early
*  because it distracts you, doesn't keep you focused, etc.
*  So I think it's very important to find where to invest the money.
*  This is why markets are so important because we're not that good at it.
*  I admit I teach entrepreneurship, but if I were that good at picking the right investments,
*  I would be a multi-billionaire and I'm not.
*  It's a difficult business to do.
*  That's where the market is useful.
*  My fear is that Google, especially because the governance of Google resembles more the
*  governance of Italian companies rather than the one of American companies.
*  There's not a lot of floating voting stock.
*  The power is concentrated in the end of a few people.
*  As long as these few people are at the top of their game and they're smart and they are
*  in the right sector at the right time, great.
*  But as we all know, people age, world change, and there will be a time in which they're
*  not up to the game and they need to be replaced.
*  And at that time, the temptation for them to waste a lot of money would be pretty strong.
*  I'm going to try an exercise here.
*  I know I'm the interviewer, but I have a somewhat speculative bent as well.
*  So you've worked in a lot of different areas and I'm going to try to give my account of
*  what I see is the underlying unities in your thought.
*  So you have these papers, many more, a true stack would be higher.
*  And there's a lot of breadth there, but I think it is tied together.
*  And I'll tell you how I see it as tied together and you respond to that.
*  Okay.
*  That sounds fantastic.
*  There's maybe two or three ways of thinking about what you've done.
*  So a lot of your main papers, they're about corporations or politics.
*  So I read you as taking some core areas of economics and then pretty consistently suggesting
*  that culture really matters and governance really matters.
*  And doing that consistently for businesses and government.
*  There's another way I think of what you're doing.
*  This is maybe more Italian.
*  So take the Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci, who wrote about hegemony and power and control.
*  To me, you read like someone who read Gramsci at an early age, was quite struck by it, maybe
*  didn't agree with it, but you're taking all of his questions and re-asking them about
*  control and hierarchy, but with real economics and with something like scientific method.
*  So in both ways, you're quite this Italian thinker.
*  I have the same.
*  All thinkers are regional thinkers.
*  You just have to figure out what the region is.
*  So you're redoing Gramsci with economics or you're redoing economics with culture and
*  governance.
*  And then there's this other Gramscian dimension to your thought that just as he thought, he
*  once said, you know, in the medium of the intellect, I am a pessimist, but when it comes
*  to the medium of the will, I am an optimist.
*  And there's this see-sawing back and forth of the extreme pessimism and extreme optimism.
*  And I see that in your work too.
*  You're an Italian who came to the US with such high hopes.
*  In many ways, you love it, but in other ways, you're deeply disappointed and you keep on
*  seeing the unities between US and Italy, corporations and government, and the practical pessimism
*  of this state of affairs, and yet you're propelled to do something about it by writing, speaking,
*  being a public figure and so on.
*  That would be like my two-minute version of who you are, what you do.
*  And what do you say to that?
*  It's fantastic.
*  I wish I had thought about it.
*  Now, seriously, I think that is very true.
*  By the way, the only thing that you probably miss is that this tension between the North
*  and the South, and is also Gramsci, is called Bloco Storico, is the bloc that ruled Italy
*  for a long time, was this alliance between the Northern elite and the Southern elite.
*  It was exactly Gramsci.
*  So I think that intellectual tradition also of Chicago, Stigl√®, when he sort of invented
*  regulatory capture, was borrowing from Marx.
*  It's sort of right-wing Marxism, right?
*  You told me you're a quarter Sicilian.
*  What's the part of your thought that's quarter Sicilian?
*  I have a huge sense of pride, which is not typical of my region.
*  It's typical of Sicilian.
*  My grandfather was in the military, but in his life he did three duels.
*  He won them all.
*  That was part of the culture of Sicily at the time.
*  What is interesting is a very interesting mechanism.
*  If you are in the military and you are challenged to a duel, if you did it, you are punished.
*  If you did not do it, you are demoted, which is the right way to think.
*  You don't want to encourage something like this, but you don't want to encourage people
*  to be cowards.
*  So I thought it was a brilliant system.
*  So I think I have this element that goes back to my Sicilian roots.
*  Another Gramsci in question, also an Italian question.
*  In Europe, you're European, it seems to many of us there's some kind of line.
*  And Gramsci asked, what's the difference between East and West?
*  And where in Europe would you draw that line?
*  And what, from culture, what from governance, all the different areas of your research?
*  What determines that line?
*  And why is, say, Macedonia in this situation it is right now, and Southern France is not?
*  It seems to have something to do with that line.
*  It's very interesting, because when I go to Istanbul, I find it part of Europe in every
*  sense, at least part of my world.
*  I don't know whether I belong to Europe or not, it's all relative.
*  But Byzantium is so similar to Venice that it's impressive.
*  So I feel completely at home in Istanbul.
*  Is Venice a bit raw?
*  So how can you feel different?
*  I've never been to Macedonia.
*  But definitely, when you go to Moscow, you feel it's a different world.
*  So it's interesting, because my notion of culture is probably more Mediterranean than
*  East-West.
*  So I feel fairly at home in the Mediterranean.
*  And I went, actually, to Iran before Obama reached the deal, because I'm an Italian citizen.
*  So I could go to Iran without any problem.
*  And I was moved by how European, if you want it, the Persian culture is very much linked
*  to all the tradition in the Mediterranean.
*  And so I don't feel it's so much East.
*  And by the way, Iranian people are super lovely people, and they're not anti-American.
*  In fact, you find more anti-American in France than you find in Iran.
*  They haven't seen us for so long, right?
*  I'm going to try an exercise I did with Jeff Sachs.
*  I'm going to toss out a few terms, people's names, whatever, and just ask you, overrated
*  or underrated?
*  First one, campaign finance regulation, overrated or underrated?
*  Actually, paradoxically, overrated in the sense that capture takes a lot more subtle
*  ways than just campaign financing.
*  So it is an important consideration.
*  But even if tomorrow we could fix that, I don't think we would have fixed the capture
*  problem.
*  So overrated, OK.
*  Angela Merkel, overrated or underrated?
*  I think it's probably underrated.
*  I'm impressed by her ability to, number one, run Europe for the interests of Germans in
*  a very effective way.
*  You should be impressed.
*  She's elected by German people.
*  She has no European constituency.
*  So she does her job as a politician extremely well.
*  Now, it doesn't correspond to the interests of the rest of the Europeans, but that's a
*  different.
*  But the other thing that I'm impressed is how she handled the immigrant crisis.
*  We're creating a positive feeling toward Germany that was absent in Europe and taking, I think,
*  the right approach.
*  We want refugees because refugees are the best people.
*  It not only is a moral obligation to save people that escape extermination, it's also
*  an economic consideration.
*  These are the most talented, the most entrepreneurial, the most dynamic people in the world.
*  We want to have them.
*  But given your work on the persistence of culture, can Germany and Merkel absorb 800,000
*  Syrians a year, for two or three years?
*  Do you think so?
*  I think that's an excellent question.
*  I think that this is something that is not discussed enough about immigration, is the
*  process of assimilation.
*  I think that it's important to try to get immigrants that are more similar so that they
*  assimilate faster, precisely to avoid those fractures that we've seen in the French banlieue,
*  in the suburbs of Paris and so on and so forth.
*  I think that probably 800,000 people are what?
*  It's less than 1% of Germany.
*  It's close to 1%.
*  Yeah, it's close to 1%.
*  I think in a year it would be a lot.
*  But it depends on how fast they are in learning German.
*  But they already have a pretty good Turkish population that is not perfectly integrated,
*  but they made them win the World Cup.
*  So I think they're pretty high up in the national respect and prestige.
*  Pope Francis, overrated or underrated?
*  I have to say I love Pope Francis.
*  I think it's hard to say he's underrated because everybody loves him.
*  But not being a Catholic, I've been raised Catholic, but I'm not a practicing Catholic
*  by any stretch of the imagination.
*  And I've been known to be an anti-clerical all my life.
*  And I've been an anti-clerical because I really thought that the problem of Italy was that
*  the church was there.
*  And once I actually was discussing with the Cardinal in Chicago, he said, no, no, the
*  problem is the other way around.
*  It's the problem of the Vatican is the Vatican is in Italy.
*  And I thought he was joking, but when they elected Pope Francis, I realized it was true.
*  First of all, Pope Francis was elected basically by northern and southern American cardinals
*  who were sick and tired of the Italian mafia in the church.
*  And they were sick and tired of why?
*  Because they ended up being sued here in the states and losing money in the states for
*  responsibilities of the Vatican, and the Vatican did not chip in one dime.
*  Not only that, it was wasting money with this IOR, Instituto Operat religiose, that was
*  a money laundering organization.
*  Something that should be dedicated to charity was a money laundering organization.
*  And Pope Francis is changing all this.
*  And my only hope is that he's not killed.
*  Because I think that the chances of him being killed is not zero.
*  But he's fantastic.
*  So Italy should elect someone from Argentina.
*  I wouldn't go as far as that.
*  I think, look, I don't think Argentina is the monopoly of a good leader like, and actually
*  the tradition is not in that direction.
*  I'm just saying, Pope Francis is a fantastic leader.
*  And I wish Italy had a leader like that.
*  A related question from some of your research.
*  Is Christianity good for economic growth?
*  And if we look at those border areas of Africa, does it matter much for their future economies
*  if they go Christian or Muslim?
*  If I look at the data, I think that Muslim religion is not generally associated with
*  good attitudes for capitalism.
*  And Muslim traders do very well around the world, right?
*  Sure.
*  I'm not saying that you can't be successful as being Muslim.
*  What I'm saying, and I don't think that it is necessarily the Muslim religion, per se,
*  is the association of the way religion has been practiced and diffused in countries that
*  are mostly Muslim.
*  I might be wrong on that because I think Weber was wrong on saying that Catholicism is such
*  a disaster.
*  I think that Catholic countries caught up fairly well.
*  I think that some of the Protestant ethics is useful in the system, but I don't think
*  it's necessarily the major cause of our retardation in development.
*  So I think it's something you want to think about, but I don't think it's the major cause
*  of underdevelopment around the world.
*  Lucchino Visconti, the Italian film director, overrated or underrated?
*  Underrated.
*  I think he's fantastic.
*  I think that the best movie ever is The Leopard, done by him.
*  And what's the social science lesson in this movie?
*  The story is a very sad story, but it's a very true story.
*  There's a story of the northern troops arriving in Sicily and liberating Sicily, and the nobility
*  there saying, we should change to remain the same.
*  And so this ability of Italy, which by the way I think is absorbed from the Catholic
*  Church who survived that long, is to change, not to change, to appear to change, to leave
*  everything unchanged.
*  And it's really a desperation, but the movie is wonderful.
*  There is a Claudia Cardinale out of this world, and Bart Lancaster and Alain Delon, really
*  a fantastic thing.
*  And I show it to my wife, she thinks it's slow, because last three hour and a half.
*  It's not something that generally you have in Hollywood movies, but the quality of the
*  scenes and the quality of also the silences is out of this world.
*  I once saw it on a big screen at American Film Institute.
*  It was quite a help.
*  It's a classic case where the movie was not worse than the book, you might say.
*  I think exactly one of the few cases.
*  I never read a book first and then saw a movie that I thought that the movie was the same
*  level of the book.
*  The movie is better, I think, actually.
*  I don't agree.
*  I think they are the same level, which for me is the only case I can mention.
*  Beppe Grillo, is he actually funny?
*  Yes.
*  He is funny.
*  So if I understood Italian, I would laugh.
*  Yeah, it has some foul jokes, but most sort of comedians have.
*  I think that certainly more funny than Trump.
*  Is he funnier than you?
*  Definitely.
*  No, look, there is one thing you have to realize about Beppe Grillo.
*  First of all, he has a sort of degree in accounting, which first of all is not normal for a comedian.
*  Second, makes him more qualified than most people, certainly most comedians, to read
*  income statement balance sheets.
*  He started, before he even was a politician, he started being kind of an agitator in Ciroldo's
*  meeting and going to Ciroldo's meeting with one chair and started to ask questions and
*  and pose sort of problems in Italian corporate governance and was very successful, at least
*  at raising the level of awareness.
*  So in that sense, he did something very valuable.
*  No co-authors, no colleagues, but who is the most underrated living economist?
*  This is a very, very difficult question.
*  Who is the most?
*  I would have said Gordon Tarlok.
*  I did not just pass away.
*  I think that he was really underrated for what he did.
*  Around here, we'll grant you that.
*  How would you say your opinions have changed in the last seven to ten years?
*  An awful lot has happened in the world.
*  The EU has not turned out the way a lot of people thought.
*  There's a lot more opposition to migration.
*  We've had a financial crisis.
*  We may be on the verge, possibly, of another global recession because of China.
*  Italy possibly or probably hasn't turned things around.
*  So over the course of the last ten years, how have your views changed?
*  I don't mean on particulars, but at the conceptual level.
*  I think that I got much more interested in monetary problems.
*  I started to study economics because I grew up in a country with double-digit inflation.
*  So I thought that was a big problem.
*  But then, by the time I became an economist, inflation was not an issue.
*  And I thought that was not particularly interesting.
*  Now all this issue of deflation, how to fight deflation, is deflation a problem,
*  I think that are topics that ten years ago I would be completely ignorant about.
*  And now I'm fascinated by them.
*  Now you think they're very important.
*  You find it striking that the world's three main currencies all have interest rates of zero.
*  Yeah, it is striking.
*  And I am torn because there is a part of me that says that this zero interest rate
*  policy is a redistribution in the wrong direction.
*  It's taking away from the people with the bank deposit and
*  give it to the guys who can easily engage in speculation, etc.
*  So from a moral point of view, I think the distribution goes in the wrong direction.
*  On the other hand, I have seen the euro zone fall slowly into deflation for
*  a six month last year when the deflation range.
*  And this maybe is my Italian heart bleeding.
*  But when you have a huge amount of debt and you start to have a deflation,
*  Irene Fisher was right, that that deflation spiral is pretty terrible.
*  And that's probably the worst possible outcome.
*  And I think that generals are famous to be prepared to fight the last war.
*  And so are economists and central bankers.
*  So the ECB has been set up to fight inflation.
*  And so it's completely not prepared to think in those terms.
*  In fact, I will raise this challenge because when the European leaders talk,
*  they say that our objective is an inflation below but close to 2%.
*  And I look for a statement of this type.
*  If you look in the sort of web page of the ECB,
*  they say that they want inflation below 2%.
*  So there's no close, it's below 2%.
*  Where inflation is measured as the harmonics price index at the European level.
*  And then they want every individual CPI of every country below but close to 2%.
*  Now, if you have an average and every term must be below 2, even with closer to,
*  the average must be below 2 by probably by a lot.
*  And so I think that the ECB has been designed basically to have deflation.
*  And I don't think they're mentally prepared to how to deal in this situation.
*  And I think that's a big issue.
*  I'm also struck by some of your work on behavioral economics.
*  I like very much the paper where you take some investors and
*  instead of showing them that this is the leopard, you show them a horror movie.
*  And you see what happens to the risk premium.
*  But there's another paper I want to ask you about.
*  It's about impatience and procrastination.
*  That is, it's often the case the same people who are very impatient then
*  procrastinate, and you give the example of people who are very impatient to get a check.
*  They'll even settle for a much smaller sum of money to get the check now.
*  But then they get the check and they don't cash it or spend it or
*  do anything with it.
*  They get it and then they procrastinate.
*  What's the underlying view or model of human behavior that causes impatience and
*  procrastination to go together?
*  You're setting me for a very low standard, right?
*  I don't think I have a model that includes everything.
*  And this is part of a larger experiment which, on some extent,
*  is still undergoing where with a colleague at Northwestern,
*  we sort of study an entire cohort of MBA students at Chicago, 550 people.
*  And many experiments that are done around the world are done with undergrad.
*  And most of them are the poorest undergrad because they're the one that
*  sort of desperately needs money, so generally art major.
*  So not really representative of business people.
*  And so a lot of people in economics dismiss some of these results because they
*  say, these are the weird guys.
*  They're not the one that will run big corporations, blah, blah, blah.
*  So we started with a sample that hopefully will run big corporations,
*  statistically as well big corporations.
*  And what we find in many of the deviations that
*  behavioral economics find are present in our sample.
*  And so the particular experiment that Tyler is talking about is at the end of
*  a bunch of games that won an amount of money that was going from zero to $300.
*  So some people were winning sort of a significant amount of money, $300.
*  We offer them to delay the delivery by two weeks.
*  And with the values interest rate, in some cases, at 10% over two weeks.
*  So 10% over two weeks over $300 is both percentage wise huge, but
*  even sort of not, $30 is sort of not trivial.
*  At least for me, maybe for my students is more important.
*  So these guys really give up receiving $30 over two weeks
*  to get the check in the mail that day.
*  However, this is the only clever thing we've done in that particular study is,
*  we follow when they cash the check.
*  And on average was two weeks, but 10% never cashed it.
*  They lost it.
*  So they are so eager to get their stuff.
*  But then, and I think that if I had to give a sense is the salience of this.
*  So honestly, these people,
*  everybody should have accepted delay payment.
*  Because we check, 90% of them were not maxed out in their credit card.
*  So what it means receiving a gift in cash,
*  actually a check is not even a gift in check today over two weeks.
*  Once you know you have received it,
*  we think we were fairly credible as a faculty promising.
*  So I think the credibility issue was not a major.
*  If you know that you have won $300,
*  you can go and spend it today on your credit card and get the check two weeks from now.
*  The fact that you want to have it now, I think is an interesting aspect about saliency.
*  And the fact that once you have it, you relax and
*  you forgot to check it, to cash it, is I think pretty interesting by itself.
*  Speaking of procrastination and impatience,
*  what's your view on the future of the European Union?
*  It seems to me it cannot fully integrate, because unlike with North and
*  South Italy, there you actually have a fully integrated electorate, right?
*  You have a single set of elections where you choose a national leader, and
*  everyone more or less accepts it.
*  It's very hard for me to see that for Europe.
*  So I suppose my expectation will be that the ties become weaker and weaker.
*  Schengen falls away.
*  There's not a fiscal union.
*  The euro becomes a bit more like a currency board.
*  National central banks keep certain kinds of liabilities.
*  But what's your prediction for say 20 years from now?
*  European integration, more of it, less of it, and what's the underlying model?
*  So quoting Gramsci, let's first give sort of the pessimistic rational view
*  is that there would be a breakup between the Northern Europe and the Southern Europe.
*  The wishful thinking, or not the wishful thinking is too bad,
*  is the optimism of, well, the desire to make a change.
*  And that's what I think every sensible human being should be working for,
*  is to try to actually make the European project a democratic project.
*  So you're the people who are going to vote.
*  Somebody that can decide something, because we elect a parliament that
*  is not the real power to appoint a prime minister, to appoint somebody.
*  And nobody really respond to the European people.
*  Of course.
*  So I think that any injection of democracy is what is most needed.
*  And hopefully all the tension will emerge.
*  If you want to be optimistic, like I want to be,
*  the United States did not have an easy route.
*  And as I said at the beginning, there was a lot of tension and
*  there was a civil war.
*  So in order to, hopefully in Europe we are ready for
*  the civil war too in the last century.
*  So we don't want any more of that.
*  The fact that the process is not linear, I think is inevitable.
*  The fact that there are tensions and bumps is inevitable.
*  The important thing is at least you see the right direction.
*  And this is what sometimes I'm not so sure that everybody sees.
*  And I think the right direction is more democracy.
*  Last question before we open up to the crowd.
*  You're now director of the Stigler Center at Chicago.
*  And you've studied organizations for your whole career.
*  Given what you've learned, we're here of course at the Mercatus Center,
*  hosting this event.
*  But how will this shape what you will do with the Stigler Center as an economist?
*  So I think that the first thing is spend time in hiring the best possible people.
*  I think that one thing that works well in university is that we spend
*  a huge amount of time selecting faculty.
*  And so a lot of what we do is listening to seminar, reading papers,
*  refereeing papers, selecting the next generation.
*  What I've learned in various organizations is the best,
*  most successful organization is the one that spends a huge amount of time
*  sort of selecting the good people.
*  Because it's very costly to fire.
*  You don't want to fire unless you have to.
*  And once you get the right people in place,
*  organization wouldn't say random self but almost.
*  And if you don't have the right people in place,
*  you spend a lot of time fixing the hiring mistakes.
*  There's now a little bit of time for questions.
*  Please, questions not statements.
*  Go up to the mic.
*  We will alternate how we call on you.
*  How many minutes are left?
*  Ten minutes?
*  Okay.
*  First, if you make a long statement, I'll just cut you off.
*  This is for our guest to answer.
*  First question, yes.
*  Thank you very much for coming.
*  My name's David Willey.
*  I'm a research assistant with the Mercatus Center.
*  Part of our research is looking at the connection between the financial
*  services industry and small business creation.
*  And as you know, on a number of measures, small business creation is down.
*  Innovation seems to be down in the US.
*  What in your view is the connection, if any, between the financial services
*  industry and the problems in that industry and the decline in innovation,
*  the decline of new business creation in the US?
*  Thank you.
*  So I think that the role that the financial sector has in
*  promoting new businesses, innovation, and so
*  so small business is crucial.
*  And that's much of the first book with Raghu was dedicated precisely to
*  celebrate his role.
*  Now, do they succeed always so well?
*  And the answer is no, because there are some frictions.
*  Ironically, there was a period, I don't think we're there anymore, but
*  there was a period in which venture capitalists were so much flooded with
*  money that they had to sort of de-shout this money sufficiently fast that they
*  had to shell it out in big pieces.
*  So they were only financing more advanced companies because they couldn't find the
*  time to actually shell it out in small pieces at the time.
*  So it's very important that you have capital in the right people to do that.
*  If I were to point out the major problem to financial innovation today in
*  the United States, I know the financial system.
*  In other countries, I would think it's financial system.
*  Italy clearly the financial system.
*  In the United States, it's more sort of a patent policy and
*  other form of bias to entry.
*  One story that I tell in my book that really motivated me to write the book is
*  when I got approached by some students that were trying to start a company.
*  And the first thing that they had devised was basically a lobbying plan.
*  And I said if the first thing, part of the business plan is a lobbying plan,
*  then we have a problem in America.
*  Over here, question.
*  Frank Mannheim, School of Government Policy and International Affairs, right here.
*  I wonder if you have taken a look or
*  compared the environmental regulatory policies in Europe
*  with those in the United States, which are in quite a bit of debate right now.
*  And what your thoughts about the comparisons might be.
*  I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I have not looked at that.
*  I think that your idea is extremely good to make the comparison to see also
*  which lobbies are winning the game.
*  Because my bet is that the differences in regulation are driven entirely by
*  who are the most influential groups across the board.
*  So I was talking to some farmer in Italy,
*  they were saying in regulation of how much, how good it's called, not copper.
*  What do you give on the vineyard to, there is a copper base
*  stuff that you put on the vineyard to prevent some diseases.
*  There is some regulation.
*  There is only one exemption in Europe and is for the plant,
*  now escapes the name, would you make the beer.
*  Because the Germans wanted to make sure that you could produce sort of enough of
*  that to produce the beer.
*  So regulation, unfortunately, not just in the United States, but
*  also in Europe is driven by this special interest.
*  So I think would be a very nice comparison to do.
*  Next question.
*  Thank you.
*  My name is Alexander Skouris from the Atlas Network.
*  I'm from Greece, so that's what I'm about to ask you about.
*  Please don't laugh.
*  I know that you have been following what's going on in Greece and
*  in other European countries as well very closely.
*  The question is very simple.
*  Given the current, the new agreement that the European Union signed with Greece,
*  is there anything or any under conditions you would see something good coming out of it?
*  And second part, what can Greece can do in order to get out of the crisis if we
*  forget about the debt negotiation which we must assume that it's gonna take place
*  somewhere sometime soon?
*  Yeah, so the big hope is that eventually there will be some debt forgiveness in
*  some form that is not called debt forgiveness, but
*  is delay of payment to infinity that is not an out of debt for business.
*  This is why politics is so hard,
*  because as an economist you call this pay the spade.
*  And if you sort of forgive in present value,
*  is it debt forgiveness, but in politics it's very different.
*  So I think that that's the hope.
*  And the big fear that I have is the political backlash.
*  We have seen with the rise of Syriza, now Syriza has been sort of
*  tamed and made part of the European elite.
*  All of a sudden all the newspapers in Europe are celebrating our greatest
*  CIPRAS, the same guy that until yesterday was sort of a communist,
*  revolutionary, a dangerous, now is sort of part of the European team.
*  Why? Because a sign on the dotted line, whatever they told him to sign.
*  So my frustration is I agree with a lot of the reforms
*  that the European Union is imposing on Greece.
*  I think that longer term would probably benefit Greece.
*  But I am a democratic at heart and I think that the reforms,
*  you should own them, this should not be imposed on you.
*  And I think that inevitably the northern countries
*  are trying to do with Greece what the northern Italy did with southern Italy.
*  They're trying to not to fix Greece, but to minimize the problem for Europe.
*  So nobody really in Brussels except maybe the Greek
*  representative care about Greece and Greek people.
*  They care about stability in the EU and
*  getting that problem off their agenda.
*  Exactly like in Turin, people did not care about people in Sicily.
*  They care that the revolt would be sedated.
*  And they did whatever it takes to sedate the revolt.
*  Including, by the way, aligned with the mafia.
*  One of the reasons why the mafia is alive and
*  well is because it was a method of control of Sicily
*  that the northern army used very effectively.
*  And the long term costs are huge.
*  Now I'm not saying that the European Union is helping the Greek mafia, but
*  I wouldn't sort of exclude it.
*  I wouldn't exclude it.
*  Also because the people that best can negotiate with the European Union in
*  Greece are part of the Greek elite.
*  People who speak English, travel abroad,
*  are part of the very elite that run the country up to now into the grounds.
*  Corrupt, crony, and every negative thing that you want to say.
*  And why do you expect these guys all of a sudden to change just because they're
*  blessed by the European Union?
*  I don't think that's the case.
*  So I think that I thought that the so
*  called bailout of Greece in 2010 was a disaster.
*  It was really a bailout of French and German banks.
*  So cover with the pretence of helping Greece.
*  And I think that since then, we're not recovering from that mistake.
*  So I think that that's a really sour spot in the European history and
*  something that will weigh very heavily in the future.
*  We have time for just a final very quick question and quick answer.
*  Next please.
*  Hi, my name is Steven Jones.
*  I'm an MA fellow at Mercatus and I do have a quick question which is,
*  in your little vignette at the beginning,
*  you noted that the cafe shop workers are so unbelievably productive.
*  And I'm just wondering why you would want somebody to be that productive in a cafe.
*  Is it because Italians value coffee that more or
*  maybe labor regulations or something else entirely?
*  So we come back full circle to Italy.
*  Luigi.
*  You actually raise an excellent point.
*  My wife was American, walking to a auto grill in Italy.
*  And she's amazed by the fact that a guy speaks perfect English.
*  She said, much better than yours.
*  And sort of she discovered that this guy has a university degree and
*  in English literature and he was serving coffee at the auto grill.
*  I think that that's pretty depressing.
*  I think that that's maybe the reason why Italian cafe is so
*  good is because sort of there are no other opportunities.
*  Actually, I have this line, again comparing the United States and Italy.
*  I notice that in Italy, on average,
*  the personal assistants are great, are really fantastic.
*  And managers are not that good.
*  And so I said, wait a minute, why is that the case?
*  Obvious, because the market doesn't work.
*  If you don't sort out the market, you can have some very talented people
*  doing jobs that generally don't require the talent.
*  And you have, unfortunately,
*  non-talented people doing jobs that require a lot of talent.
*  So my favorite line that did not make me very popular in Italy,
*  Italy is the country with the best secretaries and the worst managers.
*  On that, three announcements to close.
*  First, big round of thanks for Luigi.
*  Next, September 24th is Dany Roderich.
*  And finally, Luigi will be outside signing books.
*  He has three books.
*  Any book you bring, he will sign.
*  Luigi, thank you again.
*  A great honor and pleasure to have you.
*  My pleasure.
