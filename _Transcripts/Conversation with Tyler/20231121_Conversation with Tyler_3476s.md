Video Description: Though most know him first as a humor columnist, Dave Barry’s career has spanned many forms of media, including books, movies, TV, and music. Driving this relentless output, says Barry, is the constant worry he’ll find himself stuck in a rut — or worse — no longer funny. And do we even need professional comedians in an age where so many funny amateurs are readily available online?
 
Tyler and Dave discuss all these topics and more, including the weirdness of Peter Pan, what makes Florida special, how it felt to teach Roger McQuinn a lick on the guitar, and why business writing is so terrible.

# Dave Barry on Humor, Writing, and Life as a Florida Man | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw)
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=0.0s)]
*  bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=8.32s)]

*  Hello, I'm here today with Dave Barry, and we're going to talk about humor, Dave's life, and Dave's career. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=22.6s)]
*  My first question about humor has to do with YouTube. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=33.92s)]
*  So a lot of the funny things you have written, rather than doing stand-up, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=37.72s)]
*  and now there's YouTube as a kind of competitor to written humor. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  How has that changed what readers are looking for, and what new constraints does that put on you? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=46.16s)]
*  Well, the second part is easy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=51.72s)]
*  None. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=53.6s)]
*  For me, I'm too old to change. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=54.16s)]
*  I basically do what I've always done. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=56.56s)]
*  I do think YouTube and the internet in general have radically changed the humor industry, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=59.44s)]
*  especially for younger audiences, which are much more oriented towards meme-y things that they see, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=69.44s)]
*  other people looking at shorter things, shorter bits, things that require a lot of insight and knowledge, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=76.56s)]
*  which everybody seems to have now thanks to the internet. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=82.12s)]
*  And I mean, if I can extend it to not just YouTube, but Twitter and Instagram and Facebook, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  and everything happens so fast, and everything builds on everything else so quickly, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  and things become old almost instantaneously or become mutated so much instantaneously, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=102.12s)]
*  it's really hard to keep up, which is why I don't really try that hard, to be honest. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  If I think of the humor I consume, I've realized today compared to when I was a kid, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  how much of it is from amateurs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  So there's some one-star reviews on Amazon that are actually hilarious. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Twitter can be funny. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  It's very context-dependent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=123.28s)]
*  Maybe you know this South Korean video of Robert Kelly, the man doing an interview. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  He's trying very hard not to be funny, and his two children barge into the room, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=130.32s)]
*  and they're removed by his wife. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=134.36s)]
*  Truly, if you were to hire professional writers to write a scene and professional actors to act in, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=135.76s)]
*  you could not possibly have outdone that particular 30-second sequence. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=143.44s)]
*  I mean, it was just so wonderful because it was real. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=148.24s)]
*  And because he's trying not to be funny. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=151.16s)]
*  But if there are billions of people out there, and say each one is really funny once in their lifetime, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=154.44s)]
*  and some of that gets captured on YouTube, and you have aggregators or filters, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=160.28s)]
*  as a professional comedian, you're competing against the funniest moment of each amator, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  often unintentional. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  So do you think it's the case that professionals now, they become more like brands? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  So if I watch Stephen Colbert report, to me, it's funny. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  He's not as funny as that moment by Kelly. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=180.08s)]
*  So he almost to me is a kind of watchman, or he reassures me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=183.28s)]
*  And that's made the comedian somewhat, in a sense, deliberately not that funny? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  They play a different role? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=191.0s)]
*  Or how do you see that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=193.6s)]
*  I just think that the real comedians, like Colbert, he's basically delivering jokes written by a staff of writers, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=194.0s)]
*  and curating whatever they got from the internet, or presenting whatever they curated from the internet. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=201.28s)]
*  But guys like Louis C.K. and David Chappelle are still creating their own humor, and it's still really funny. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=207.32s)]
*  And it's them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not anybody else. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=216.48s)]
*  It doesn't look like anybody else. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  So yeah, there's way, way more of it out there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=219.32s)]
*  And it's probably tougher to be really original, to sound really original than it used to be. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=222.56s)]
*  But I think there's an awful lot of consumers as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=231.16s)]
*  And there just seems to be this huge appetite for more funny. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=236.0s)]
*  So I don't know that it's worse for it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=241.92s)]
*  And in some ways, it may be easier. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  Like if you are a kid who wants to get known as a comedian, you don't really have to anymore go the incredibly difficult route [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=245.0s)]
*  that most of the stand-up comedians I know went, which is starting out at Catch a Rising Star, or someplace much worse than that, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=255.48s)]
*  and doing all those stand-ups in front of three drunks, and slowly getting noticed, and finally getting hired by somebody. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=261.32s)]
*  You can just go on the internet, make a funny video, and sometimes that will produce fantastic results for you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=269.24s)]
*  Is the half-life of a joke much shorter now? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=276.68s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=279.16s)]
*  I mean, everything, as I say, I cannot keep up. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=280.52s)]
*  Personally, I don't even try to keep up. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  I see something that everybody tells me is funny. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  I look at it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=288.48s)]
*  But to try to stay on top of all the stuff that's coming out, you can't do it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=289.04s)]
*  But does it mean we end up in a world where, in a sense, humor is rarely intentional? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=293.72s)]
*  And it's the moments that weren't expected to be captured. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=298.36s)]
*  That's what we laugh at. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=301.56s)]
*  And humor is a kind of science. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=303.0s)]
*  Will it dwindle? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=304.68s)]
*  No. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=305.88s)]
*  I mean, that is still going to be, yes, that's part of it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=306.4s)]
*  But as I say, there's still a lot of people who are very creative and are going to continue to be funny. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=310.88s)]
*  They're just going to use whatever is going on around them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=314.96s)]
*  And it may be a lot more internet-oriented than it used to be. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=317.92s)]
*  But in the end, I don't think people's sense of humor has changed that much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=321.84s)]
*  It's sort of more the way it gets fed to us now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=327.36s)]
*  And say 20 years from now, do you think there will be more professional comedians in this country or fewer? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=329.96000000000004s)]
*  I do not represent the Humor Bureau. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  I have no earthly idea. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  I do think that, in the particular field that I'm in, which is writing with the archaic form of actually writing words down, it's certainly changed. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  The day of the newspaper humor columnist, which is what I was, is pretty much over. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=352.96s)]
*  Because the newspaper's over. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=358.56s)]
*  The newspapers are over. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=359.64s)]
*  There's no more audience for it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=361.08s)]
*  The people have no more time for it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=362.32s)]
*  So longer-form humor does seem to be disappearing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=364.6s)]
*  On the other hand, there's a million good TV shows, I think more than there ever used to be funny TV shows. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=367.2s)]
*  They keep popping up. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=372.68s)]
*  They're on Amazon. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=374.28s)]
*  They're on Netflix. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=374.96s)]
*  Some of them are really pretty fun. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=376.04s)]
*  I can't keep up with them all. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=377.12s)]
*  But I'm always surprised at the quality. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=378.68s)]
*  So there seems to be more outlets, maybe, than there used to be, if for not the kind of humor that I did. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=381.32s)]
*  But still, it's written humor. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=386.88s)]
*  It's scripted humor. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=388.88s)]
*  If we think of the political content of humor. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=390.4s)]
*  So I think back, say, to the 1960s. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  There's Lenny Bruce. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  There's Richard Pryor. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  What's funny at that time, it seems mostly to be anti-establishment in some way or left wing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=397.76s)]
*  John Stewart today, again, Colbert. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  There's some conservative or libertarian comedians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  There's PJ O'Rourke. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  There's yourself. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  There's Drew Carey. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=410.84s)]
*  But do you think that the medium of humor today has a slant politically one way or the other? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=412.4s)]
*  And what is that slant? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=418.44s)]
*  I mean, it is a leftist slant. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  But why? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=421.64s)]
*  Well, because that's what the cool kids think. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=422.76s)]
*  All the other cool kids are doing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=426.28s)]
*  It's kind of funny because it's not very subversive anymore. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=428.0s)]
*  It's what could be less subversive than the humor industry during the eight years of Barack Obama, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=431.2s)]
*  where we never made fun of Barack Obama. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=439.76s)]
*  He was the president. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=440.28s)]
*  And there were some funny guys, a Nobel Prize for doing absolutely nothing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=441.88s)]
*  But you just didn't, nobody made fun of him. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  As they continued pounding on, I'll never forget, and here I will be unable to sum up the details, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=446.64s)]
*  but it was one of the many White House Press Association dinners while Barack Obama was president. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  And he's there and Donald Trump's there. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  And I can't remember who the comedian was, but he spent the whole time ripping Donald Trump, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  who was at the time some schmo in the audience. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=463.64s)]
*  He wasn't the president sitting right next to him. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=466.23999999999995s)]
*  And it, to me, kind of epitomized the way it is. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, we're allowed to, you know, in the humor biz, beat up all we want on Republicans [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=470.88s)]
*  because they're stupid idiot Republicans and their followers are all redneck morons. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=476.48s)]
*  But at some point, that ceases to be even remotely creative. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=481.32s)]
*  I mean, that point was reached a long, long time ago. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=485.08000000000004s)]
*  So I think there was kind of a steep decline in the quality of American political humor, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  from which we haven't really recovered, combined with the fact that a lot of what passes for humor now [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=495.68s)]
*  on both sides is just vicious attacks. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=500.76s)]
*  And some of them are very clever and some of them are very funny, but it isn't really that, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=503.08s)]
*  it isn't that funny, it isn't that creative. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=506.56s)]
*  It's just sort of, I'm going to smear, you know, how many times do you have to be told Donald Trump has weird hair? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=509.44s)]
*  At some point, you would think this would be exhausted as a source of humor, but it's not. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you think there's room for a new right-wing kind of humor? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=522.08s)]
*  Maybe not a right kind of right-wing that you like, but say now there's alt-right, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=524.88s)]
*  it's at least perceived as new, it's outrageous to many people. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=528.56s)]
*  I think, well, is this the new direction of funny? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=532.68s)]
*  I know, I don't think. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=534.84s)]
*  Or is there something intrinsic about humor that it's left-wing, is a left-wing slant? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=537.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, definitely not. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=542.08s)]
*  I mean, humor should be subversive and it's a lot more subversive to be right-wing than left-wing, these days. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=543.68s)]
*  A pro-Trump humorist, I don't know if any exist, would be a lot more subversive than any of the 90 billion. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=552.6s)]
*  Trump himself is the pro-Trump humorist. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  In a sense, he's too funny to make fun of. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=560.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, or just too out there to, you know, he's such a caricature by himself that it's hard to character. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=562.52s)]
*  But, you know, like, okay, there's a guy, are you familiar with the blog Ace of Spades? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=575.2s)]
*  The guy's funny. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=575.72s)]
*  The guy is a funny, funny writer. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=576.52s)]
*  You know, I don't always agree with him, but he's funny. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=578.44s)]
*  He's really good and he's viciously anti-left. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=580.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's rare. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=586.04s)]
*  And but when you see it, it's like, wow, that's different. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=587.4s)]
*  You know, I admire the skill that takes to do what he does and I don't see it that often. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=590.04s)]
*  Malcolm Gladwell, in one of his podcasts, he criticized the Tina Fey skits of Sarah Palin. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=595.48s)]
*  Gladwell, of course, doesn't like Sarah Palin. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=601.4s)]
*  And he thought that Tina Fey, even by mocking Sarah Palin, since Tina Fey was a likable person, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=604.6s)]
*  a likable character, it humanized Sarah Palin for the audience and that the satire was counterproductive. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=609.96s)]
*  What do you think of that argument? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=615.96s)]
*  It's just like overthinking it so badly. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=617.24s)]
*  You know, that's not how any normal person reacted to Tina Fey's Sarah Palin, which was brilliant. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=620.2s)]
*  You know, so no, I'm sorry. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=626.6s)]
*  I don't know Malcolm Gladwell and I know he's a brilliant man, but that's way overthinking it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=630.44s)]
*  And Alec Baldwin doing Donald Trump. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=634.0400000000001s)]
*  How funny do you think that is? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=636.2800000000001s)]
*  It's pretty funny, but again, it's like this is a pretty easy target to be taking a swing. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=637.8s)]
*  I mean, there's a big pinata up there and everybody's got a stick and everybody likes [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=643.4799999999999s)]
*  to swing at the Trump pinata. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=647.16s)]
*  I personally have just kind of gotten to the point where I don't pay that much attention [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=649.0799999999999s)]
*  to Trump jokes anymore because they all seem to be the same joke to me. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=652.5999999999999s)]
*  Hey, look at what he said. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=656.3599999999999s)]
*  Like, he doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=657.4s)]
*  He's a moron, you know. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=658.76s)]
*  Now, some things cross borders fairly easily. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=661.0s)]
*  A lot of different kinds of foods, not all kinds of foods. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=663.88s)]
*  Some, but not all kinds of music. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=667.0s)]
*  It's striking to me that humorous movies cross borders less, it seems, from box office data [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=669.48s)]
*  than say action movies or even what would appear to be quite culturally specific dramas. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=674.92s)]
*  What do you think it is about the border that limits the appeal of humor? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=679.96s)]
*  Probably in part, you know, the English language. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=683.4s)]
*  I mean, if I just speak from personal experience, what little I know of, you know, anything I've [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=686.52s)]
*  seen in the mind that was translated and what little I understand of the other language, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=691.8s)]
*  it's extremely difficult to translate humor and have it come off the same way. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=695.72s)]
*  It's easy to, you know, translate somebody beating the crap out of somebody else. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=701.08s)]
*  So action movies are going to lend themselves, I think, far better. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, if it's English to English, I think probably American comedies do okay in English-speaking [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=708.6s)]
*  countries. I don't know for sure. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  I know English-speaking comedies from England do pretty well over here. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=716.12s)]
*  So Canadians, on average, seem funnier to me. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  That would be a selection mechanism. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=722.44s)]
*  Canada is the funniest country in the world. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=723.96s)]
*  It just hides it much better than... [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=725.56s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=727.4s)]
*  But so much British humor, I literally feel I don't understand it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=727.9599999999999s)]
*  There's something about it that's very flat to me. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=731.64s)]
*  In a sense that the British audience are in New Zealand, they're guffawing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=734.76s)]
*  And that word guffaw, I would never use the word guffaw to apply to myself. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=738.04s)]
*  Well, they don't actually guffaw out a lot of times. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=742.04s)]
*  They just acknowledge the humor of it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=745.7199999999999s)]
*  British way. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=746.1999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, yeah, you have to accept with British humor that no British person [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=746.92s)]
*  has ever in history ever said what he actually thought about anything. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=750.04s)]
*  Every British person ever says is meant sarcastically. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=753.64s)]
*  So it's because they're less direct. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=757.08s)]
*  They are way less direct. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  They refuse to ever say anything directly. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=759.88s)]
*  And that's kind of the wonder of them. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=762.12s)]
*  I'm the kind of person I hardly ever find slapstick funny. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=764.2s)]
*  Me too. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=767.4s)]
*  And if I look at old slapstick, it doesn't seem funny at all. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=767.96s)]
*  Intuitively, you would think slapstick being only physical would have a much longer half life. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=771.1600000000001s)]
*  What I find funny is very culturally specific references. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=777.4000000000001s)]
*  Am I strange? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=783.96s)]
*  Well, not about slapstick. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=785.8800000000001s)]
*  I never thought that when I was a little guy, I maybe thought the three stooges were kind of funny, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=787.24s)]
*  but that stopped a long time ago. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=792.6800000000001s)]
*  Some physical humor is still funny to me. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=794.36s)]
*  Abbott and Costello were pretty physical, but they were funny without being slapstick. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=797.0s)]
*  Just punch, you know, hitting each other in the nose and going, yuck, yuck, yuck. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=801.5600000000001s)]
*  Never struck me as funny at all. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=804.76s)]
*  I missed the second part of your, I've forgotten the second part of your question. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=807.56s)]
*  You mentioned Abbott and Costello. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  If you're willing, I'll talk about a few comedians or mention a few, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=813.16s)]
*  and you can tell me what you found funny with them, didn't find funny. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=816.04s)]
*  Let's start with Abbott and Costello. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=820.76s)]
*  Favorite of my father. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=822.52s)]
*  I've watched almost all the movies. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=824.12s)]
*  As a kid, I didn't find them funny, but I actually started to find them funny in [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=827.16s)]
*  retrospect after having watched a bit of Seinfeld and Larry David. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=831.4s)]
*  What's your take on Abbott and Costello? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=834.92s)]
*  Yeah, I can see the connection there. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=836.6s)]
*  It more relies on you letting the humor slowly develop and the characters themselves [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=839.3199999999999s)]
*  being the humor without coming right out and saying what's funny about it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=846.52s)]
*  The one who never understands what's going on, the one who's always [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=849.56s)]
*  losing his patience with the other one. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=855.0s)]
*  The first maybe three or four times, it's just mildly amusing, but after a while, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=857.3199999999999s)]
*  when you see it coming, that becomes very funny to you. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=861.4000000000001s)]
*  It's very rare to find that kind of patience and humor anymore. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=865.0s)]
*  I don't think the audience is as generous as it used to be, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=870.36s)]
*  allowing humor to build the way it did in an Abbott and Costello stedge. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=872.76s)]
*  And is Abbott or Costello funnier to you? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=877.08s)]
*  Abbott being the straight man. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=879.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think Abbott is funny. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=880.2800000000001s)]
*  I think he's much funnier. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=881.5600000000001s)]
*  Someone who just passed away. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=883.32s)]
*  I was watching him on YouTube recently, Don Rickles. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  It was Don Rickles was a funny man. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=888.68s)]
*  I always felt that he was one of the things I liked about him. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=893.56s)]
*  I saw he's a little out of control and I know that was contrived, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=896.2s)]
*  but I think at least early in his career, it was pretty real. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=899.32s)]
*  You see some of the older performance. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=902.52s)]
*  He says things sometimes on the old Tonight Shows that everybody's just dying. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=903.96s)]
*  And then you realize none of them really knows exactly why that was so funny. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=908.52s)]
*  It was just that he said something that nobody would have thought to say. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=913.48s)]
*  But he says some things that we, or at least I, wince at. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=916.84s)]
*  I mean, could there be a Don Rickles today? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=920.52s)]
*  He's a kind of equal opportunity insulter, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=922.28s)]
*  but a lot of it would at least seem to be in bad taste. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=925.4s)]
*  But since it's applied so liberally, I mean that word in the multiple sense. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=928.36s)]
*  Well, it would work anywhere except on a college campus [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=932.36s)]
*  where, of course, you can't say anything at all. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=934.6s)]
*  But I think we have to distinguish between college campuses and comedy clubs. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=937.64s)]
*  Comedy clubs, you can still say pretty well. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=943.88s)]
*  You can be racial. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=945.56s)]
*  A lot of comedians still are very racial. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=948.5999999999999s)]
*  And everybody says, yeah, it's fine. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=951.0s)]
*  He's kidding. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=952.8399999999999s)]
*  He's not really a racist. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=954.3599999999999s)]
*  He's just going on the stereotypes that everybody is aware of, whereas he can't say. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=955.56s)]
*  But I see non-white comedians being much more deploying racial humor than white comedians. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=960.5999999999999s)]
*  Generally, they can because they can. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=966.28s)]
*  Because they can. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=967.64s)]
*  But even, I don't know, even white comedians will do it as long as the understanding is, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=969.0799999999999s)]
*  hey, I'm kidding. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=973.8s)]
*  You know I'm kidding, which, of course, you can't do on a college campus anymore [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=974.68s)]
*  because nobody's allowed a kid. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=977.8s)]
*  Do you think there's anything people don't find funny anymore, even in a comedy club, campuses aside? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=979.64s)]
*  If I saw, I mean, yeah, I will speak from my own personal experience as a dad of a daughter. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=987.4s)]
*  If I saw a guy get up and doing underage rape jokes, it just wouldn't. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=995.64s)]
*  Even if it were really brilliantly funny, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1000.92s)]
*  the only guy who even came close was Louis C.K. did a really edgy joke not too long ago, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1003.16s)]
*  basically about pederasts that came really close to, you know, and even then everybody [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1009.64s)]
*  kind of winced when he did it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1016.5999999999999s)]
*  But it was daring and funny. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1017.7199999999999s)]
*  But I myself would draw a line there. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1021.4s)]
*  I want to say like the Holocaust, but I've seen people make incredibly funny Holocaust jokes. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1026.12s)]
*  Again, it all depends on the context and it all depends on your understanding of their [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1031.96s)]
*  sensibility and what you're really laughing at. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1035.72s)]
*  You're not really laughing at the Holocaust. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1038.1200000000001s)]
*  You're laughing at the anxiety or the something around it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1039.8000000000002s)]
*  But that takes certain skill on the part of the comedian. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1044.68s)]
*  It's kind of hard to say in general. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1048.0400000000002s)]
*  How about Eddie Murphy? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1049.96s)]
*  How funny is he? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1050.92s)]
*  Well, he used to be really funny. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1051.96s)]
*  I mean, his standup in his day was as good as it got. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  And his, you know, what was it, Beverly Hills Cop and a couple of movies like that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1056.3600000000001s)]
*  Coming to America is one of my favorites. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1061.32s)]
*  He was really, I don't know what happened. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1063.7199999999998s)]
*  I guess he just got too successful. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1065.48s)]
*  They need to be funny anymore. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1067.56s)]
*  Or maybe he just got tired of it, which I think happens. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, God bless him. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1073.0s)]
*  If you get tired of it, you don't have to keep doing it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1074.04s)]
*  Then that's fine. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1076.1999999999998s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1077.3999999999999s)]
*  You don't have to live up to my expectation, Eddie Murphy. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1078.1999999999998s)]
*  But he was really funny. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1080.4399999999998s)]
*  Now, one of your favorites, if you could tell us what you find a value in him. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1081.9599999999998s)]
*  And that's Robert Benchley. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1085.8s)]
*  A lot of what he wrote was in the 20s. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1087.08s)]
*  I was just rereading his essay on New Yorkers versus Midwesterners. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1088.6799999999998s)]
*  And who are the true Americans? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1092.84s)]
*  And I thought it was better than things I might have read last year on the same topic. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1094.4399999999998s)]
*  What is it about Benchley that makes a fair amount of it pretty enduring and influenced you so much? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1098.84s)]
*  Well, he was radiantly intelligent. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1104.4399999999998s)]
*  This was a very well-educated, cultured man who made a very good living as a critic. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  And would have been able to have a quite successful career as a theater critic or a literary critic. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1115.96s)]
*  He was a smart guy. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1123.24s)]
*  And he was in the movies like you. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1124.44s)]
*  His career in some ways. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1126.68s)]
*  He sort of, he was sorry that he did that in a way. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1128.04s)]
*  He took the money and, you know, he regretted, I think, at least on a... [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1131.48s)]
*  He might have regretted more if he didn't do it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1136.92s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1138.68s)]
*  And he did make some pretty funny shorts. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1139.72s)]
*  But the other thing, the reason that I loved him and still love him, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  it was that he was that rare comic writer who was willing to be really silly. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1145.48s)]
*  Silliness is an underrated part of humor. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1153.32s)]
*  Most people in the end would rather be cool than silly. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1156.36s)]
*  And, you know, snide and condescending and a lot. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1160.04s)]
*  Then just be out there and being genuinely silly. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1164.04s)]
*  Robert Benchley was silly. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1167.96s)]
*  He would take extreme left turns in the middle of an essay about one thing [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1170.04s)]
*  and suddenly be an essay about something completely different. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1175.8s)]
*  He didn't care. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1177.8s)]
*  As long as he thought it was funny, he went for it. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1178.84s)]
*  And that was the thing that when I was a kid just drew me to him. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1181.0s)]
*  I was used to being presented with Mark Twain as a humorist. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1185.8s)]
*  Now, Mark Twain is a funny guy and he wrote some funny stuff. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1189.1599999999999s)]
*  But you don't laugh out loud. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1191.48s)]
*  Well, you maybe do once every in a great while reading Mark Twain. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1193.0s)]
*  You smile and chuckle. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1196.52s)]
*  Robert Benchley made me laugh out loud when I was a kid. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1198.2s)]
*  And I thought that's what I wanted to do. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  How about jokes in books? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1204.12s)]
*  So say when I was a kid, I think I was eight, I had a book of jokes. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1205.8s)]
*  And there was one I kept on bringing around to my mother. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1209.1599999999999s)]
*  I read it to her about five times a day. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1211.72s)]
*  And the punch line was, I'm sick and tired of all this bickering about oatmeal. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1213.96s)]
*  Now today, if I say that sentence to myself in my mind, I still laugh. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1218.9199999999998s)]
*  But I know the joke was never funny. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1222.9199999999998s)]
*  Are just jokes listed in books. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1225.16s)]
*  Is that a joke? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1227.72s)]
*  Because I missed it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1228.44s)]
*  No, that's just only the punch line. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1229.16s)]
*  The joke is not funny. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1230.8400000000001s)]
*  I missed that one. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1233.48s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1234.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1235.16s)]
*  How funny are jokes listed in books? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1236.6000000000001s)]
*  It used to be you could buy these books all the time and now you don't see them much. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1239.0s)]
*  There's Chuck Lasterman, there's Sedaris, there's you. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1242.8400000000001s)]
*  But now we have Twitter and now we have the internet. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1245.72s)]
*  But even before Twitter, it seems those books were disappearing. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1248.68s)]
*  They were. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1251.24s)]
*  Is it because they weren't funny? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1251.72s)]
*  I'm trying to remember the line. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1252.68s)]
*  No, it's just people don't have... [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1253.72s)]
*  People don't read books anymore. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1255.8s)]
*  As far as I can tell. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1258.84s)]
*  But if they want humor, they look on their phone. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1260.76s)]
*  Whatever was funny now on their phone, that's what they're looking at. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1263.64s)]
*  A printed page with a bunch of jokes on it would seem incredibly archaic to somebody like my daughter. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1267.24s)]
*  Here's a movie, if you don't know it, will just pass. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1273.24s)]
*  But Mike Judge's Idiocracy. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1275.24s)]
*  Yeah, I never saw the movie. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1277.64s)]
*  So I do know the principle of it. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1279.32s)]
*  It's a way in the field. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1281.48s)]
*  Like some professional wrestlers, the president of the United States. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1283.32s)]
*  And everyone's an idiot. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1286.04s)]
*  The first half hour is brilliant, I think. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1287.0s)]
*  At least watch that much of it. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1288.76s)]
*  When did Mad Magazine stop being funny and why did that happen when it did? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1291.32s)]
*  I don't know if it stopped being funny. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1296.52s)]
*  I stopped reading it when I started reading like National Lampoon, which struck me as more, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1297.72s)]
*  I don't know, a little more grown up. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1303.16s)]
*  And maybe I was wrong because Mad Magazine was... [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1306.2s)]
*  Some of the old parodies in Mad were just brilliant. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1309.08s)]
*  It seems it was an influence on you, right? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1312.12s)]
*  It was. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1313.8799999999999s)]
*  I read a lot of Mad. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1314.36s)]
*  I mean, I read every issue of Mad Magazine when I was like 10, 11, 12, 13. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1315.1599999999999s)]
*  And I can't honestly say that it stopped being funny. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  I stopped reading it, so I don't know. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1324.4399999999998s)]
*  But maybe by the mid-80s, it became harder for it to be daring [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1326.6s)]
*  because you have other comedians and mainstream media. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1329.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, before the internet. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1332.04s)]
*  But being more daring, Eddie Murphy would be an example. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1333.08s)]
*  So Mad didn't seem so outrageous anymore. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1335.72s)]
*  Do you think that's it? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1337.72s)]
*  That could be. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1338.68s)]
*  And then we had a crossover into television. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1339.24s)]
*  Like Saturday Night Live, we brought the sensibility of my generation to TV, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1343.48s)]
*  a complete willingness to mock everything, mock commercials the way Mad used to. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1349.0s)]
*  Nobody on television mocked television. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1355.48s)]
*  And suddenly there was this show that was mocking everything about television. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1357.48s)]
*  And then the Larry Sandling show, where it became kind of a staple of television [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1362.28s)]
*  to mock television. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1368.12s)]
*  And Letterman was going to make a whole career out of that. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1369.56s)]
*  So maybe we didn't need a magazine anymore to say, hey, look how silly TV is anymore. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1372.76s)]
*  So, you know, CV was doing that for us. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1377.9599999999998s)]
*  You've said in one of your essays that you can't really pin down what makes things funny [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1380.12s)]
*  in a consistent sense, that there's something surprising about it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1384.36s)]
*  But you think a lot of humor stems from fear and despair. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1388.04s)]
*  What is it you think that we fear and are despairing of so much? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1391.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, the simplest thing is we fear that we're going to die. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1395.72s)]
*  And before we do, our lives are really pretty meaningless. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1399.88s)]
*  I mean, they're basically, you know, the world is a completely unfair, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1403.64s)]
*  ridiculously unfair place. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1410.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, things keep happening to people that should never happen to anybody. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1412.76s)]
*  And it seems to be pretty random how they happen. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1415.96s)]
*  And I think basically the two reactions to that are religion. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1418.92s)]
*  In other words, there really is a reason for all this. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1423.16s)]
*  And it really is going to end up OK. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1425.32s)]
*  And if you don't buy that, then there's humor, you know, like, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1428.2s)]
*  which is to me just this kind of weird psychological reaction human beings have developed [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1431.24s)]
*  to tolerate how scary and unfair the world is. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1436.6s)]
*  I mean, there's no good reason to have humor. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1440.12s)]
*  No practical reason that I can think of no evolutionary benefit to it, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1444.12s)]
*  other than it keeps us from going insane. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1447.8799999999999s)]
*  So in your theory, religious people are less funny because religion is their substitute. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1450.28s)]
*  Or they become more skilled at dealing with despair. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1455.16s)]
*  And so they're more funny. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1457.5600000000002s)]
*  I think they're less funny. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1458.92s)]
*  So comedians tend to be atheists. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1460.1200000000001s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1461.88s)]
*  I mean, I think that this is and this is not to dismiss religious. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1463.0s)]
*  My dad was a religious person and he was a funny guy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1467.24s)]
*  But that generally the two things, one tends to mitigate the other. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1469.88s)]
*  And to be really edgy funny, it's probably better if you don't believe in anything good is coming. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1474.6000000000001s)]
*  Is this why so many successful comedians have been Jewish in this country? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1482.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, that's assuming that Jewish people are more likely to be atheists, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  which is probably a pretty good assumption. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1489.48s)]
*  That and the fact that they're a historically persecuted group [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1492.8400000000001s)]
*  that managed to somehow find ways to survive using often their wits. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1498.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably part of why there are so many Jewish comedians. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1505.5600000000002s)]
*  That and the fact that everybody, if you're Jewish, everybody you know is funny, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1510.6799999999998s)]
*  like trying to be funny anyway. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1514.1999999999998s)]
*  It's like revered in that community, that skill, the ability to make people laugh. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1516.28s)]
*  Mormons historically have been a persecuted community. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1520.52s)]
*  And they're a wacky fun group. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1523.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1525.8s)]
*  But I don't know if there's any Mormon comedians. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1526.6799999999998s)]
*  Sarah Silverman. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1531.32s)]
*  They came along just for the purpose of giving, who are those guys, the South Park guys, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1532.28s)]
*  something to make fun of. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1537.8000000000002s)]
*  And that may be their divine purpose on earth. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1540.1200000000001s)]
*  They're also too libertarian oriented. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1543.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1545.0800000000002s)]
*  And we libertarians love the Mormons. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1546.0400000000002s)]
*  But social conservatives as comedians, that's a lot tougher, right? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1548.0400000000002s)]
*  Social conservatives. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1553.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, people who think there should be strict drug laws. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1554.68s)]
*  Have a prudish approach to sex. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1559.88s)]
*  Can't they be funny about something else? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1562.2s)]
*  You're not going to see that much. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1563.96s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1565.72s)]
*  But our ability to compartmentalize as human beings, just the fact that we could say, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1567.16s)]
*  at times, find a joke about the Holocaust funny, that suggests we're wonderful compartmentalizers. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1571.48s)]
*  But the people who are social conservatives, they can't compartmentalize? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1577.0800000000002s)]
*  What does that tell us about humor? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1581.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, I think you have to look at the reason they are social conservatives to begin with. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1582.76s)]
*  And it's probably in part because they are religious people, which goes back to my feeling. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1586.68s)]
*  It's not that it's funny that the world is set up the way it is. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1591.64s)]
*  It's because there's a divine plan for it and rules we need to follow. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1594.44s)]
*  This is not how a humorist thinks. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1597.4s)]
*  The humorist thinks, no, there's no divine plan and these rules are stupid. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1599.8s)]
*  You kind of have to be on some level pretty subversive, I think, to be funny. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1605.16s)]
*  Here's a question from Chuck Lasserman from his Cocoa Puffs book. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1611.64s)]
*  See what your answer is. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1615.88s)]
*  Every person you have ever slept with is invited to a banquet where you are the guest of honor. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1617.3200000000002s)]
*  No one will be in attendance except you. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1621.96s)]
*  The collection of your former lovers and the catering service. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1624.2s)]
*  After the meal, you're asked to give a 15-minute speech to the assembly. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1627.48s)]
*  What do you talk about? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1631.32s)]
*  I would try to seduce the catering service. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1633.72s)]
*  There being only people there, I haven't already slept. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1636.52s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1639.16s)]
*  That would be... [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1640.92s)]
*  I would complain about the catering service. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1641.8s)]
*  I think I would have to spend... [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1647.4s)]
*  First of all, it might be, in my case, not that huge a group, to be honest. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1649.88s)]
*  I could just address them individually. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1654.2s)]
*  It wouldn't take that long. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1655.56s)]
*  But it would include your wife. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1656.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1658.1200000000001s)]
*  I have slept with my wife. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1658.76s)]
*  Are there common targets of humor you think are unfairly maligned other than just the [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1660.1200000000001s)]
*  common tendency to attack, say, Republicans or the right, but at the social level? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1664.6000000000001s)]
*  Not so much anymore. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1675.4s)]
*  There was a time when half the jokes you heard, and this was in my lifetime, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1676.44s)]
*  were like Polish jokes, whatever. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1682.9199999999998s)]
*  Isn't we think back, it was kind of stupid. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1686.12s)]
*  Polish people are not less intelligent. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1687.3999999999999s)]
*  Chopin, right? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1689.3999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1690.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1690.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's joke about Chopin. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1690.84s)]
*  Yet, that was a staple of humor. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1692.6799999999998s)]
*  Some of those were pretty funny jokes. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1695.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't hear them anymore. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1697.56s)]
*  But now, yeah, I think now it's more likely to be a political target. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1700.28s)]
*  Whichever side it is, I'm inclined to view that kind of humor as lazier. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1705.3999999999999s)]
*  It's more like, I know you're on my team, so if I mock that person, we'll both get a good laugh, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1711.3200000000002s)]
*  and it also will prove we're smarter than that. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1716.6000000000001s)]
*  That's kind of the format, the template for a lot of the humor now. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1718.92s)]
*  For the most part, it's not really based on anything real. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1723.8s)]
*  It's kind of silly to pretend that all Republicans are stupider than all Democrats, in my opinion, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1727.16s)]
*  or the other way around. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1732.28s)]
*  It's kind of either way, it's kind of a dumb template to start with. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1733.72s)]
*  And yet, that is sort of the template now for both sides. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1737.24s)]
*  One of my readers sent in a question. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1743.08s)]
*  Would love to hear him talk about sentence structure and its relationship [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1746.36s)]
*  to the effectiveness of written humor. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1750.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, there is. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1751.8s)]
*  Do you have any comments on that? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1752.28s)]
*  I do. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1753.08s)]
*  I do. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1753.56s)]
*  This is my life, is writing sentences that are intended to make people laugh. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1754.36s)]
*  And you start with the idea of the joke, but then to execute it so that it actually works. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1759.32s)]
*  It's very similar to what a stand-up comedian does, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1764.44s)]
*  but he does it with timing and emphasis. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1766.92s)]
*  And in written humor, you do it with spacing and punctuation and a few other tricks. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1769.72s)]
*  But yeah, the key, and this is the most obvious example of why sentence structure is important, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1774.04s)]
*  and yet it is violated all the time in humor writing by amateurs, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1779.88s)]
*  is that the funny part has to come last. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1784.44s)]
*  And then when it comes, it has to end there and go on to something new. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1786.52s)]
*  And very often, the funniest part of the sentence, if it's poorly done, will be in the middle. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1791.0800000000002s)]
*  And then there'll be words after. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1795.64s)]
*  If you watch a stand-up comedian, he'll never deliver a joke where there's more words after [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1798.3600000000001s)]
*  the funny part. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1801.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1802.68s)]
*  But in written humor, that's done a lot by people who don't know what they're doing. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1803.48s)]
*  So yeah, sentence structure is really important. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1807.48s)]
*  And how formally do you think about grammar when you do this? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1809.4s)]
*  A lot. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1812.0400000000002s)]
*  For a long time, well, it seemed like a long time at the time. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1812.76s)]
*  Seven, eight years, I taught effective writing seminars to business people. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1816.8400000000001s)]
*  I was young, and I looked even younger. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1820.1200000000001s)]
*  But I had to get up in front of engineers, chemists, lawyers, sometimes accountants, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1822.76s)]
*  people who were accomplished in their fields, but were not necessarily good at writing. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1828.84s)]
*  And I was supposed to talk to them about how to write reports and letters and memos. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1834.28s)]
*  And they challenged me because I looked like I was 10 years old, and they expected to be bored also. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1837.64s)]
*  So I became a grammar fanatic just in self-defense because I got challenged so often. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1845.4s)]
*  Why do I say it's OK to end a sentence with a preposition when they were told that you can't [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1853.24s)]
*  do that? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1857.8799999999999s)]
*  Why did I say it was OK to start a sentence with and or but when they were told you can't do it? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1858.52s)]
*  They had all these rules that they were told that aren't rules of grammar and never were. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1863.0s)]
*  And so I became, I don't think I can anymore. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1867.8s)]
*  I could diagram sentences. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1871.56s)]
*  I could cite usage experts. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1873.4s)]
*  So I became very interested in grammar. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1877.48s)]
*  I was always a pretty good writer, but I was a much more aware writer when I came out of that [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1879.32s)]
*  experience. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1883.96s)]
*  Now, I mean, I use grammar more to mess it up for humorous effect than I do. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1884.76s)]
*  I don't try to teach anybody grammar. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1890.04s)]
*  But I did find the grounding I got was helpful. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1891.48s)]
*  Now, you once wrote that after eight years of trying to teach business writing, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1895.32s)]
*  you became convinced it would never get any better. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1898.6s)]
*  But this is now later. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1901.0s)]
*  We're in a different time. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1902.2s)]
*  There's the internet, which actually gets many people writing much more, not always for the [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1903.6399999999999s)]
*  better. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1907.56s)]
*  But do you think, you know, fast forwarding to 2017 has business writing in any way improved? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1908.28s)]
*  I'm not as on top of it as I was when I was reading hundreds of letters and memos, you know, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1913.56s)]
*  every week. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1918.28s)]
*  But my guess is no. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1919.56s)]
*  There are certain fundamental things that business people have trouble with. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1921.3999999999999s)]
*  And what's the main thing they get wrong from the business mentality? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1926.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1930.68s)]
*  The most consistent mistake, not mistake, but inefficiency of business writing, and it was [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1931.08s)]
*  very consistent, is the absolute refusal on the part of the writer to tell you right away what [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1939.96s)]
*  it is, what the message he or she is trying to deliver. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1945.96s)]
*  And I used to say to them, the most important thing you have to say should be in the first [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1949.32s)]
*  sentence. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1953.56s)]
*  And they go, oh, no, you can't. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1953.96s)]
*  I'm an engineer. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1955.64s)]
*  We did a 10-year study. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1956.68s)]
*  This is way too complicated. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1957.96s)]
*  And inevitably, they were wrong. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1960.76s)]
*  Inevitably, if they really thought about it, they were able to, in one sentence, summarize why [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1962.6s)]
*  it was really important. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1967.3999999999999s)]
*  But they refused to do that because the way they found out was by spending 10 years of [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1968.44s)]
*  study and all this data and everything. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1973.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's the way they wanted everyone to look at what they did. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1975.32s)]
*  They wanted their supervisors to go plowing through all they had done to come to this [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1977.8s)]
*  brilliant conclusion that they had come to. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1982.68s)]
*  Through their history, through their thought patterns. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1984.6s)]
*  Drag everybody through. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1986.84s)]
*  And it was the one thing the newspaper people were taught to do that made more sense. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1987.8s)]
*  You don't have your reader's attention very long, so get to the point. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1992.28s)]
*  And I found it was very difficult to get even really smart business people to get to the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=1996.36s)]
*  point. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2001.96s)]
*  And sometimes it was because they really couldn't tell you what the point was. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2002.2s)]
*  And what I wanted to say, but rarely felt comfortable saying, was if you can't tell [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2006.2s)]
*  them, if you don't know what the point is, then you can't really write this report. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2009.96s)]
*  But it was always too complicated for a layperson like me to understand. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2014.68s)]
*  That was the way they did it. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2019.8s)]
*  But then I was being hired by their bosses to tell them, no, we want you to write clearly. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2021.16s)]
*  And we want you to get to the point. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2027.8s)]
*  And we want you to... [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2029.0800000000002s)]
*  And why were they at this meta level resistant to your message? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2029.8s)]
*  Because nobody else was doing it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2033.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, when I would start the class, I have 32 people in the class typically. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2035.0800000000002s)]
*  And when they would turn in all their samples of writing, every one of them wrote the same [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2041.96s)]
*  way. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2046.92s)]
*  They all wrote business-ese writing. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2047.16s)]
*  This is my parody of it, but it's enclosed, please find the enclosed enclosure. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2050.6s)]
*  That kind of formal, nonsensical, meaningless flow of words. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2054.68s)]
*  Somewhere in there would be something important, something significant, or maybe not. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2063.64s)]
*  And were the women worse or the men worse? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2070.2s)]
*  Both sides were equally bad. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2071.9599999999996s)]
*  In the same ways? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2073.56s)]
*  Very, yeah. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2075.08s)]
*  I did not notice a difference based on gender. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2075.64s)]
*  I just found very few people... [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2079.0s)]
*  The very few people are naturally clear, concise writers. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2081.3199999999997s)]
*  That's not a common trait. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2084.6s)]
*  But it was more of a thinking issue than it was a writing issue. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2087.08s)]
*  It was just this inability to see the purpose of the document as anything other than a diary, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2090.3599999999997s)]
*  to make you see what I did, as opposed to to convey important information to you. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2097.7200000000003s)]
*  Humor is one area where the enforcement of intellectual property law tends to be weak [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2104.92s)]
*  or maybe even non-existent. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2109.32s)]
*  So there are always issues or problems with comedians stealing jokes from other people, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2111.1600000000003s)]
*  whether stand-up routines or in writing. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2115.96s)]
*  Do you think it works having an area such as humor where basically IP law isn't applied? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2120.52s)]
*  And there are various conventions, and you hope that other people punish those who break the [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2127.0s)]
*  conventions, but you can't rely on that. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2131.0s)]
*  Or is humor this public good that is actually under-produced, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2133.32s)]
*  because we don't have property rights in jokes? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2136.36s)]
*  Well, it's not under-produced. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2138.76s)]
*  There's plenty of it out there. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2139.88s)]
*  I think it's kind of self-policing. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2143.16s)]
*  People do steal. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2144.6800000000003s)]
*  I have had, over the years, ridiculous experiences, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2145.88s)]
*  especially when my column was syndicated. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2149.16s)]
*  Somebody would send me a copy of his local shopper [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2152.12s)]
*  and the local orthodontist wrote a weekly column. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2155.16s)]
*  And one week I would look at it and it would be my entire column, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2158.6s)]
*  word for word, with my name changed to his name. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2161.3999999999996s)]
*  And I'd write or call these people. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2164.8399999999997s)]
*  When I was younger and more naive and had more energy. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2167.16s)]
*  And it said, you stole my column. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2170.6s)]
*  You just took it. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2173.24s)]
*  And they would go, they were never apologetic. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2174.12s)]
*  It was like, oh, I just thought it was so great. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2177.0s)]
*  But you stole it. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2180.04s)]
*  You put your name on it. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2180.8399999999997s)]
*  They didn't get that that was wrong. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2182.68s)]
*  But I think it's harder and harder to get away with that. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2186.84s)]
*  If you are a successful comedian, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2189.8s)]
*  people are going to catch you if you're stealing somebody else's jokes. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2193.08s)]
*  There's just too many people out there consuming it, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2197.32s)]
*  and seeing it in too many different forms. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2200.04s)]
*  Who's a comedian who's not so well-known, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2202.84s)]
*  who you think is fantastic and ought to be better known? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2204.84s)]
*  Written, stand up, television, whatever. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2207.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2210.92s)]
*  The ones I would name are known. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2212.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not that... [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2214.6s)]
*  But even someone like Robert Benchley, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2216.12s)]
*  while he's on one hand famous, his Wikipedia page is quite long. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2217.7999999999997s)]
*  He's not actually known. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2220.7599999999998s)]
*  Most people haven't heard of him. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2222.04s)]
*  Nobody knows who Robert Benchley is anymore. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2223.64s)]
*  This is one of the things I've been using for years as an example of why [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2225.56s)]
*  I don't expect to be famous for anything in 20 years, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2229.16s)]
*  except for talk like a pirate day, which wasn't even my idea. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2232.04s)]
*  You know, but people who do humor with so... [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2235.08s)]
*  The rarest of exceptions do not last in the culture the way people who write [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2242.04s)]
*  Tender is the Night hang around for much longer. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2247.32s)]
*  We talk about the Marx Brothers, but [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2251.88s)]
*  who goes to see Marx Brothers movies anymore? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2254.92s)]
*  We know who they are, but people still go to see Shakespeare performed. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2258.04s)]
*  Not to compare. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2262.92s)]
*  But when there were repertory theaters, I went to see Marx Brothers movies, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2264.44s)]
*  and Duck Soup at least, I think, held up pretty well. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2267.72s)]
*  Yeah, because you're old like me, and they still showed the movies when we were younger, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2270.6s)]
*  but you don't go see any more of Marx Brothers. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2272.52s)]
*  Yeah, Duck Soup holds up great. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2274.04s)]
*  That's the best one, I think. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2275.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2277.24s)]
*  But even then, like there's stretches in Duck Soup where it's just like, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2278.04s)]
*  oh man, he's still like really kind of dumb, but it's so dumb it's kind of funny. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2281.4s)]
*  Now, your latest book is about Florida, so I thought I would go to news.google.com, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2287.72s)]
*  and just enter Miami, and this is one of the first articles that came back. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2293.4s)]
*  Miami Beach police say Sigmund Hernandez confessed Wednesday to [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2299.64s)]
*  slapping and possibly choking his tiny Yorkshire Terrier and leaving her in a public parking garage. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2304.76s)]
*  The reason, he told police, the dog vomited in his car. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2310.84s)]
*  I then went to your blog, and there is a story there of [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2314.76s)]
*  quote, Zachary Kelly, 30, became upset with Phoebe, a four-month-old puppy who was acting up. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2318.04s)]
*  They said he held the animal down and bit her on the ears, and he was quote, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2324.76s)]
*  just trying to teach the dog a lesson. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2329.8s)]
*  Teach the dog a lesson. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2331.48s)]
*  Now, what is wrong with the dogs in your state? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2332.44s)]
*  The dogs are fine, the people are not. Yeah, Florida, the guy who bit the dog, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2337.4s)]
*  I didn't know, you know, after hearing the expression, man bites dog nine trillion times. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2345.48s)]
*  I don't think I've ever actually seen an example where a man did bite a dog, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2351.08s)]
*  but if it did, naturally it had happened in Florida, and that dog will not do that again, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2354.7599999999998s)]
*  whatever it was. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2360.44s)]
*  Why has Florida evolved to become weirder, say, than neighboring states? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2361.64s)]
*  Well, many reasons. First of all, it's warmer than, you know. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2366.28s)]
*  Is it much warmer than Alabama? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2370.44s)]
*  Yes, quite a bit warmer than Alabama. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2372.12s)]
*  Come to Alabama in January, and then you'll want to come to Miami. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2374.9199999999996s)]
*  It's warmer, it's much more known as a vacation destination, it's got beaches everywhere, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2378.68s)]
*  people come there, not particularly serious reasons coming there. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2383.3999999999996s)]
*  Doesn't that make them calm, though, rather than weird? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2387.7999999999997s)]
*  Is it the giant insects that make them weird? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2389.96s)]
*  A lot of them drunk is what it makes them. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2391.8799999999997s)]
*  We have ready access to alcohol and drugs of every kind in Florida. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2393.96s)]
*  We have a lot of different communities that have absolutely nothing to do with each other, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2399.56s)]
*  living in close proximity. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2403.64s)]
*  Miami, where I live, is a good example, but the whole state is like 10 different weird [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2405.64s)]
*  little communities. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2410.92s)]
*  There is no Florida, there's no sense of state pride. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2411.96s)]
*  People don't go, I'm a proud Floridian. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2416.7599999999998s)]
*  They just don't. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2418.8399999999997s)]
*  So it's kind of like nobody owns the state, and there are people just constantly showing [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2421.3199999999997s)]
*  up in the state for various reasons. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2425.08s)]
*  I would say we're like the Ellis Island for stupid, weird people. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2428.3599999999997s)]
*  You want to pleasure yourself into a stuffed animal in a Walmart, you're going to go to [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2432.68s)]
*  Florida to do that. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2436.68s)]
*  You want to get naked by the side of the road for no apparent reason. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2438.28s)]
*  Florida is the place you're from. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2441.96s)]
*  Just nothing else because it's warmer there. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2443.16s)]
*  And the law enforcement is different. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2445.08s)]
*  But they caught this man biting the dog, they caught the man who kicked the dog through [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2447.16s)]
*  the parking garage, so it's tough on law enforcement. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2451.56s)]
*  We eventually do arrest people, usually, but sometimes it's the police officers doing [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2454.6s)]
*  these things. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2459.8s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2461.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's a state where every day is a thousand more people than there were the day before. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2462.6s)]
*  So there's a lot of people that just showed up ready, looking for something in the heat [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2467.2400000000002s)]
*  and the humidity with the bugs and the lizards and the boos. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2474.44s)]
*  And it's just a toxic stew of weird is what it is. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2477.2400000000002s)]
*  I was thinking, what to me is special about Florida? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2481.2400000000002s)]
*  And one thing that struck me, asking some others as well, is how many wonderful or at [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2483.8s)]
*  least interesting movies are set there. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2488.76s)]
*  So a simple list would be Body Heat, Spring Breakers. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2490.5200000000004s)]
*  Body Heat was an incredibly good movie. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2493.32s)]
*  Of course it is, as is Spring Breakers, Key Largo, Contact, Deux Bigelow, Ace Ventura, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2495.0s)]
*  Canadian comic, by the way. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2500.2000000000003s)]
*  Some like it hot. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2501.8s)]
*  All kinds of space movies. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2502.92s)]
*  Ulysse Gold, an old movie with Peter Fonda, Parts of Midnight Cowboy. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2504.76s)]
*  All kinds of gangster movies have scenes set in Florida. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2509.7200000000003s)]
*  So why is Florida such a wonderful place to set your movie? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2512.76s)]
*  Probably because I'm guessing it has something to do with unions more than anything else. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2517.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's warm. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2522.76s)]
*  So you don't have to worry quite as much about the weather down there. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2524.04s)]
*  And yeah, it has an image to it. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2527.96s)]
*  Florida, people don't think of Florida the way they think of Alabama, even though Alabama's [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2532.84s)]
*  right next door. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2537.56s)]
*  They think of Florida as more exotic. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2539.7200000000003s)]
*  And they're right, it is more exotic. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2541.4s)]
*  It's more exotic than any other state, as far as I can tell. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2542.6800000000003s)]
*  You live near Miami. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2547.0s)]
*  Let me ask you a question about that place, which I've been to many times. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2548.04s)]
*  Am I wrong in thinking that maybe 15 years ago, Miami was more culturally central than it is today? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2551.88s)]
*  Spanish as a rising language was arguably more important. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2559.08s)]
*  There was a sense Miami might become or be cemented as a capital of Latin America. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2562.92s)]
*  It seems now even Latin America in some ways has just turned its back a bit on Miami. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2567.8s)]
*  Not in a hostile way, but they've developed their own urban centers more at media empires [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2571.96s)]
*  outside of Miami more. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2577.16s)]
*  It seems to me a slightly forgotten city along with Los Angeles. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2580.6s)]
*  Art Deco people aren't as interested in anymore. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2583.88s)]
*  Maybe for the better of Miami. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2587.64s)]
*  Well, I don't want to get all chauvinistic, but I dispute all of those. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2589.48s)]
*  Okay, tell us. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2592.52s)]
*  All of those. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2593.08s)]
*  No, Miami has grown like crazy. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2594.04s)]
*  Oh, it's grown, but is it as central to the American consciousness as a rising urban center? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2596.76s)]
*  As it was 10, 15 years ago. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2601.96s)]
*  I think in the sense that everybody's more used to it now, that Miami is really the capital [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2603.96s)]
*  of Latin America, but I don't think it's any more than New York has become passe. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2609.8s)]
*  It's just cemented. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2616.2s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2617.4s)]
*  Miami is the center of Latin America, but it's exploding right now. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2618.44s)]
*  I don't have any statistics to back up this feeling I have, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2628.28s)]
*  but I haven't noticed that Miami's turned into some kind of backwater now. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2630.92s)]
*  We run our government out of Florida now, right? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2635.32s)]
*  At least the executive branch. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2637.56s)]
*  Mar-a-Lot, well, yeah. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2638.84s)]
*  That's up the coast a little bit with the rich people, but yeah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2640.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's not very far. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2643.56s)]
*  No, it isn't. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2645.08s)]
*  In linear distance, it's a million, trillion miles away in culture. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2646.6s)]
*  Palm Beach and Miami are separated by Boca, which is Long Island, basically. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2650.04s)]
*  Miami is, when you get across the Dade-Broward line, you are in Latin America. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2656.04s)]
*  80% of the city, I think, speaks Spanish as its first language, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2661.0s)]
*  and a lot of people don't speak any English at all. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2665.56s)]
*  You can function comfortably in Miami your entire life and never speak a word of English, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2668.52s)]
*  read a word of English. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2673.96s)]
*  You just don't need it. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2674.76s)]
*  Whereas if you are in business in Miami, you don't speak Spanish, you are in big trouble. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2675.96s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2679.8s)]
*  So it's still a very, very, very Latin city. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2680.84s)]
*  But when you get to Fort Lauderdale and then Boca, you're in New York. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2683.32s)]
*  Then you get a little farther and you're in Palm Beach. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2688.44s)]
*  You're just in rich person land. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2690.44s)]
*  I sometimes feel that parts of Puerto Rico are more American than parts of Miami, actually. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2693.0s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2698.44s)]
*  Miami is not American. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2699.8s)]
*  It's Latin American. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2701.32s)]
*  It is Nicaraguans and Colombians and Venezuelans and Dominicans. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2703.0s)]
*  All of these people like the United States, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2709.2400000000002s)]
*  but a lot of them are not really assimilated to the United States particularly well yet. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2712.92s)]
*  The one that everybody talks about is Cubans. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2718.44s)]
*  My wife is Cuban. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2720.44s)]
*  My in-laws are Cuban. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2721.32s)]
*  They are Americans. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2723.16s)]
*  I mean, they have totally, I mean, they've lost their country and they're okay with that. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2724.12s)]
*  They're still very Latin, but they're Americans. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2729.48s)]
*  But there are large sections of Miami where people are still living essentially in Colombia, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2732.12s)]
*  or might as well be. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2736.68s)]
*  And is there to you a central author or cultural figure who represents Florida in some way? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2738.12s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2742.44s)]
*  The closest you would get would be Carl Hyson. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2743.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's what comes to mind. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2745.7200000000003s)]
*  And he kind of represents the, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2747.16s)]
*  I'm really sick of what's happened to my state side of it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2748.92s)]
*  Carl does not embrace the changes of Florida. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2752.92s)]
*  Carl would be happy if it went back to just being mostly snakes and lizards. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2756.3599999999997s)]
*  You have Zora Neale Hurston and also Graham Parsons was from Florida. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2760.2s)]
*  Even though people think of him as somehow southwestern, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2763.8799999999997s)]
*  his country sensibility is very much eastern, actually. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2766.92s)]
*  You said in one of your writings, you've lived in the suburbs of New York City, Philadelphia, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2770.8399999999997s)]
*  and now Miami, maybe other stops in between. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2776.12s)]
*  Do you think the suburbs are underrated? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2778.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think as long as they're, I mean, you know, at least where I live in Coral Gables, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2781.3199999999997s)]
*  which is a city, but it's really a suburb of Miami. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2788.52s)]
*  It's a pretty great place to live. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2792.92s)]
*  And it's kind of what it has in common with the other places I've lived is it has access to [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2796.2s)]
*  a major metropolitan area with kind of the excitement and the diversity that that implies, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2802.44s)]
*  but you can be physically more comfortable. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2810.76s)]
*  And I like that. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2813.96s)]
*  I think there's nothing wrong with that. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2815.0s)]
*  I think there's a reason people want to have a yard and a driveway. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2816.12s)]
*  And I think every American should have a right to yard and driveway. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2820.76s)]
*  One thing that really struck me going through your life history [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2824.76s)]
*  is the depth and breadth and comprehensiveness of what you've done in so many different media. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2828.2s)]
*  You've written children's books. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2834.6s)]
*  You've been involved with television. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2836.12s)]
*  You've obviously been on the internet. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2838.68s)]
*  You wrote a weekly column for many years, business writing, worked with Walt Disney. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2840.44s)]
*  There's a rock group called the Rock Bottom Remainders that you were in for a while. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2847.08s)]
*  So my sense is there's something quite special about your work habits [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2851.7999999999997s)]
*  that is maybe the most remarkable feature about you. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2856.2799999999997s)]
*  So if someone were trying to build a career in some way and they said, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2860.04s)]
*  well, I want to learn from the work habits or career management of Dave Barry, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2862.7599999999998s)]
*  what has been going on behind the scenes that accounts for your extraordinary productivity [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2867.7999999999997s)]
*  defined along a number of different dimensions? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2873.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2877.3999999999996s)]
*  That's the most complimentary thing anyone's ever said about my work. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2878.3599999999997s)]
*  It's really striking. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2881.9599999999996s)]
*  But anyway, well, part of it is insecurity. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2883.0s)]
*  So I want to keep producing always. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2887.16s)]
*  So fear and despair. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2889.88s)]
*  Fear and despair. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2891.16s)]
*  Which makes you funny. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2891.56s)]
*  And the constant worry that you no longer can do it and that you're not funny anymore. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2892.52s)]
*  As soon as you start to be just pretty confident that anything you write is great, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2898.12s)]
*  then you're going to suck in any creative field, I think. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2901.16s)]
*  But then also, certain impatience or fear of getting into too much of a rut. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2905.72s)]
*  So wanting to try new things that you feel like are in your wheelhouse. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2916.2s)]
*  If I had said that I wanted to become a playwright, I think I would have been [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2922.6s)]
*  stretching too far. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2931.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know anything about being a playwright. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2932.7599999999998s)]
*  I wasn't trained. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2933.8799999999997s)]
*  I haven't studied, whatever. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2934.6s)]
*  But I did feel that if I could go from writing funny essays to maybe trying to write a funny novel, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2936.2s)]
*  if I looked at the funny novel as a series of funny scenes with some kind of plot, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2942.92s)]
*  which is a crude way of looking at it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2947.3199999999997s)]
*  But at least it was connected in a way that I thought maybe could make it work. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2949.3199999999997s)]
*  So it's a kind of combination of insecurity, needing to keep producing, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2955.7999999999997s)]
*  and kind of being fear of boredom, wanting to do something new that you still felt you could do [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2959.08s)]
*  competently, or at least not embarrass yourself. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2968.52s)]
*  What was it like playing music with Roger McGuinn? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2971.0s)]
*  That is sort of embarrassing myself. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2974.3599999999997s)]
*  This has been the most fun thing I have done as a grownup. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2977.08s)]
*  I'm writing a book now about things I've learned from my dog, essentially, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2980.8399999999997s)]
*  and one of the lessons I've learned from my dog is that you should not stop trying to have fun [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2985.32s)]
*  even when you get old. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2992.04s)]
*  And the most fun thing I have done as a grownup is be part of this rock band called the Rock [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2993.0s)]
*  Bottom Remainders, which is not a good rock band. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=2999.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm not a good musician. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3001.4s)]
*  What do you play? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3002.44s)]
*  I play guitar. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3003.2400000000002s)]
*  And I did it in college. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3004.2000000000003s)]
*  And I'm good enough that if you didn't know anything, you might think I could play guitar. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3005.32s)]
*  But if you know anything, you would know immediately that I can't, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3009.0800000000004s)]
*  that I just can fake it reasonably well. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3012.1200000000003s)]
*  But anyway, I got to play with not just Roger McGuinn, but Bruce Springsteen and Warren Zivon. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3014.6s)]
*  And Roger plays with us regularly, still does, although it's been a couple of years, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3019.72s)]
*  I got to admit. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3024.44s)]
*  And that has been the most fun, single fun thing, because it is unlike what I was just [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3025.88s)]
*  talking about where you want to be in your wheelhouse, you want to be where you can be [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3031.3199999999997s)]
*  competent. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3034.6s)]
*  It's an area where I know I'm not competent. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3035.16s)]
*  I don't belong. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3037.24s)]
*  And yet I get to be on the stage with this guy who's really, really great. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3038.36s)]
*  And what's Roger McGuinn like? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3043.8s)]
*  He's the nicest man. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3045.48s)]
*  And that's been the consistent thing with these musicians who have played with it. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3047.32s)]
*  Well, I guess you kind of have to be nice to be a great musician who's willing to play with a bunch [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3051.32s)]
*  of incompetent authors. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3055.48s)]
*  But Roger is like, I'll never forget the first time we played. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3057.4s)]
*  I can't even remember. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3062.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3064.6800000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3065.2400000000002s)]
*  We were playing somewhere. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3065.96s)]
*  And Roger wanted to stay on stage with us first. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3067.4s)]
*  He had done a series of Bird songs with Roger. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3072.36s)]
*  And I said, the last one we're going to do after that is La Bamba, Richie Valen's song. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3075.16s)]
*  And he goes, oh, OK. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3080.04s)]
*  I can do that. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3080.92s)]
*  And he goes, what key do you do? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3082.52s)]
*  And I go, G. And he goes, well, how does that lick go? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3083.48s)]
*  And I am going to know. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3086.36s)]
*  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3086.92s)]
*  I can play that lick. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3088.7599999999998s)]
*  And it goes like this. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3089.88s)]
*  And Roger's looking at it. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3091.4s)]
*  And I'm like, Roger McGuinn is looking at my left hand to see how to play a lick on the guitar. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3092.2799999999997s)]
*  And to me, that's better than winning a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3100.6s)]
*  It was really much more fun. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3103.88s)]
*  Now, you have a whole series of books. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3106.44s)]
*  Peter and the Starcatchers, based on Peter Pan. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3108.28s)]
*  Many have been bestsellers. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3111.0s)]
*  It's believed that more than half of the audience for these books is adults, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3113.32s)]
*  although superficially they might seem to be children's books. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3117.0s)]
*  They're that, too. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3120.04s)]
*  The original novel, Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3122.04s)]
*  I mean, how do you understand that book? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3124.44s)]
*  It's a deeply weird book. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3126.28s)]
*  And what's your sense of that book? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3127.4s)]
*  And then how you and your co-author Ridley Pearson modified Peter Pan? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3128.84s)]
*  We were really naive. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3133.88s)]
*  Neither one of us had really spent much time on J.M. Barrie. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3137.08s)]
*  Both of us had been raised in the United States. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3141.2400000000002s)]
*  And our view of the Peter Pan story was the Disney cartoon, the famous Disney cartoon, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3143.0s)]
*  and Mary Martin on Broadway hanging on wires, this 43-year-old lady swinging around the stage. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3148.28s)]
*  That was our view of the Peter Pan story. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3155.32s)]
*  And so all we were thinking about was that, the American version of the Peter Pan story, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3158.04s)]
*  the myth, which is a few simple elements. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3164.2s)]
*  He can fly, Tinkerbell, Captain Hook, the alligator, I mean, the crocodile. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3167.64s)]
*  The simple elements, how could we put those together in a backstory [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3174.84s)]
*  that would be entertaining for kids? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3178.92s)]
*  Little did we know we were sticking to a hornet's nest of British people [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3181.48s)]
*  who take J.M. Barrie very seriously. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3186.68s)]
*  It's like trying to revive Star Wars. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3190.12s)]
*  Right. They don't like Americans anyway. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3192.12s)]
*  So we got a certain amount of grief from purists. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3194.8399999999997s)]
*  We had to, from the start, say, we are not trying to... [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3201.24s)]
*  We don't say we own this story. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3204.7599999999998s)]
*  We're not saying we're experts on this. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3205.96s)]
*  Here's what we're doing. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3208.04s)]
*  We're a couple of American guys taking the American view. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3208.7599999999998s)]
*  That was our idea. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3211.48s)]
*  And it worked out really well for us. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3215.0s)]
*  One of J.M. Barrie's siblings claimed that J.M. had never had sex. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3217.0s)]
*  Now, we know from one of your earlier answers, that's not the case with you. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3220.68s)]
*  Is this a dark vision, Peter Pan? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3226.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, I went back and read it. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3228.9199999999996s)]
*  And yeah, it's more, I would say, more weird than anything else. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3230.8399999999997s)]
*  Just kind of a strange story, the way it's told. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3235.64s)]
*  And I honestly can't say I was a huge fan of it. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3239.96s)]
*  You know, it's hard to... [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3244.52s)]
*  Mary Gatesgill wrote recently that it's about how young men are not interesting [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3245.7999999999997s)]
*  and women of all sorts are completely replaceable. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3250.2s)]
*  And you go through life with these relationships [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3254.8399999999997s)]
*  and they're all transitory and meaningless. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3258.04s)]
*  And somehow from that comes a book that people are dearly attached to. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3260.8399999999997s)]
*  And that, to me, is strange. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3264.9199999999996s)]
*  It is strange, but I've always kind of felt that what they were attached to... [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3266.2799999999997s)]
*  Because if you listen to people, they don't quote, you know, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3269.3199999999997s)]
*  long passages from Peter Pan. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3272.12s)]
*  In the end, it's like when you ask almost anybody, certainly any American, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3274.44s)]
*  what's Peter Pan about? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3278.92s)]
*  It's a little boy who never grows old and can fly. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3280.44s)]
*  All of which is true, but you don't get... [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3283.0s)]
*  But that's a little sick in a way, right? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3285.24s)]
*  A little boy who never grows old and who can fly? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3287.56s)]
*  I mean, would you want that life? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3290.44s)]
*  When I was eight, yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3291.88s)]
*  And in retrospect? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3294.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, I could not. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3297.96s)]
*  It's a kind of punishment. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3299.24s)]
*  One of Dante's circles of hell. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3300.68s)]
*  And not to get all heavy on it, but in our books, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3302.44s)]
*  we do try to deal with the fact that Peter has to accept [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3305.08s)]
*  that his friends are all going to grow old and leave him, as Jan Berry does. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3308.52s)]
*  I mean, that is, in a way, the sad part of it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3312.44s)]
*  Although mostly it's like, isn't it cool that he can fly? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3317.4s)]
*  But your Peter Pan is more of a Bildungsroman, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3320.2000000000003s)]
*  where Peter develops in a healthy direction. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3322.6s)]
*  So it's more for Americans. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3325.08s)]
*  And there's a girl who's really great and strong and nice and... [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3326.28s)]
*  And does she really love him? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3330.92s)]
*  She does, they do, but they can't ever be really in love [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3332.84s)]
*  because he keeps the same age and she keeps getting older. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3336.52s)]
*  And are you ever tempted to be funny in those books? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3340.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3342.84s)]
*  There are a couple scenes where I go for humor, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3346.04s)]
*  but one of the things I like about writing novels [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3349.8s)]
*  is that you don't have that burden on you. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3352.28s)]
*  When I write a humor book, it's my feeling is every sentence is supposed to be funny [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3354.2000000000003s)]
*  or leading to the next sentence, which will be funny. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3358.52s)]
*  And with a novel, you're telling a story, which to me is a much more kind of [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3361.64s)]
*  relaxed process, less frantic when I'm writing it. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3368.52s)]
*  Like, what would he say then? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3371.32s)]
*  And what would he say then? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3372.84s)]
*  And what would they do then that would keep you engaged, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3373.64s)]
*  but it doesn't have to make you laugh, which is a lot of pressure. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3376.6s)]
*  And to close, could you give us any hint as to what you're planning on doing next? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3379.56s)]
*  Continued immaturity followed by death is my plan. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3384.36s)]
*  Now, I'm writing a book, it's like I said, it's about dogs. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3387.96s)]
*  It's about my dog, whose name is Lucy. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3393.2400000000002s)]
*  And it'll be called, I think, Lessons from Lucy. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3395.2400000000002s)]
*  But it was like, I'm going to turn 70 this year and Lucy's going to turn 70. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3397.8s)]
*  She's 10. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3401.8s)]
*  So in dog year 70. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3403.4s)]
*  And I was thinking about it, when I was thinking about a dog book, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3405.08s)]
*  and I was thinking, she's still really happy. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3407.4s)]
*  She is unchanged in that sense, in the happiness that she's changed in her, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3410.52s)]
*  in her appearance and what she can do and everything. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3417.3999999999996s)]
*  But she's still pretty happy all the time. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3419.3999999999996s)]
*  And I'm thinking, what does she do that I don't do? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3421.64s)]
*  I'm pretty clear, I'm not as happy as I was when I was 19. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3425.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I'm happier than I was 19. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3430.2s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3431.7999999999997s)]

*  Well, I'm way past that. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3437.08s)]
*  So I'm on downhill slope. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3438.68s)]
*  So I'm looking to my dog for help. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3440.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3442.52s)]
*  And if she doesn't give it, I'm going to bite her. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3443.3199999999997s)]
*  Dave Barry, it's been a pleasure chatting. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3444.76s)]
*  Same here. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nTSMbf52rw&t=3447.6400000000003s)]
