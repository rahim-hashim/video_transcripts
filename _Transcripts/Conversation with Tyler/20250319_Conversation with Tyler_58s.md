# Ezra Klein shares how Operation Warp Speed balanced innovation and equity | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8)
*  And I always find two things really remarkable about that story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  One is that they really did quite a bit under Donald Trump. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=2.72s)]
*  And it's very unfortunate, I think that this both policy and structure [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=5.84s)]
*  of policy got disowned afterwards. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=9.28s)]
*  But they did quite a bit to speed the ability to not just bring these [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=11.38s)]
*  things to research and to market, but the government was very active in there [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=15.52s)]
*  trying to figure out how to make sure supply constraints and secondary items [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=20.04s)]
*  like vials, because you know, the vials need to be refrigerated and so on, that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=24.64s)]
*  wouldn't retard the rollout. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=28.64s)]
*  I thought the government was doing a good job on that with Operation Warp Speed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=30.6s)]
*  And then when it came out, because the government had done a lot for it, there [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  was a very strong equity component in it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=35.52s)]
*  When that came out, it was not that the richest people were the only ones who [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=37.72s)]
*  could get COVID vaccines, but the cost of that vaccine at the beginning was zero. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=41.52s)]
*  And it was zero for everybody in America and people could go and they could get it [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=46.08s)]
*  at CVS. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=49.28s)]
*  I mean, we really did pair a aggressive supply side policy with an aggressive [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=49.84s)]
*  demand side policy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=55.0s)]
*  And I don't think we do that enough. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0scFvxAfSQ8&t=56.64s)]
