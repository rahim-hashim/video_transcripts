# How can we adapt to the growing drone security challenge?  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ovt9pPFYLQ)
*  Is there a forthcoming era of assassination by drone?
*  Do we know this?
*  Can we prepare for it?
*  What will that look like?
*  Presidents never step outside?
*  To be honest, it's not outside the realm of possibility.
*  I mean, you can ask the question today,
*  what US military installation or important government site
*  is adequately defended against an extremely advanced,
*  unprompted surprise drone attack?
*  I would guess the number is very few, if not perhaps zero.
*  And there are people now very actively,
*  not only at Homeland Security, but in the Department of Defense,
*  looking at how you defend against this.
*  But it's very hard.
*  Drones are small.
*  We don't have early warning radars in the same way
*  that we missed the Chinese spy balloon that are tuned to detect drones.
*  So now people are asking questions.
*  Can you use cell phone tower transmissions
*  and use AI algorithms to process from that
*  and detect flying small drones that we don't expect to be there?
