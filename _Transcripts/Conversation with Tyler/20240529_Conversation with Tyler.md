# Michael Nielsen on Collaboration, Quantum Computing, and Civilization's Fragility  CWT
**Conversation with Tyler:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4CoSJtVWxA)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm here in San Francisco chatting with Michael Nielsen.
*  Michael is hard to introduce and also difficult to prepare for because he knows and has done
*  so many different things.
*  He's from Australia, has a PhD in physics, has written what is perhaps the best-known
*  text or co-authored it on quantum computing, is one of the leaders of the open science
*  movement, has co-authored with Patrick Collison on progress in science, has worked at Y Combinator,
*  is an extraordinarily prolific writer, reader, commentator, tweeter, mentor to others, mentee,
*  and many other things, and currently is thinking about the fragility of civilization and much
*  more.
*  Michael, welcome.
*  Thank you so much, Tyler.
*  So you were saying there should have been a metaculous on the opening question.
*  Why is the universe beautiful to human eyes?
*  Is it selection?
*  I have no idea.
*  I mean, selection is a very attractive kind of an idea.
*  I mean, kind of to think not just instinctively.
*  But yeah, I don't know.
*  Why are there simple rules?
*  Why do we have simple rules governing the universe?
*  In fact, why is simplicity and arguably truth somehow associated to beauty?
*  I just tend to assert that this is the case, but I don't think anybody really knows the
*  reason why.
*  How beautiful do we in fact think the universe is?
*  So people don't buy paintings of the universe, people like you might, right?
*  I have a painting.
*  I have the Hubble Deep Field on my wall, of course.
*  But the most expensive paintings are not of the universe.
*  They're of people, they're of boating scenes, right?
*  I don't think that's really true.
*  The James Webb Space Telescope was about, I think was $10 billion and is arguably a machine
*  for producing that kind of image.
*  It's got to be one of the most important sort of image factories and most expensive image
*  factories ever made.
*  So I'm not sure I buy that.
*  What's the most beautiful image of the universe?
*  The image of we have a sort of a sequence of improved images of the three degree
*  microwave background is, I don't know, is it the most beautiful?
*  It's maybe the most extraordinary.
*  It really is sort of a photograph of the universe as a whole.
*  You can look at that and it says something about structure out in creation.
*  Why do the sounds of the universe not appeal to us so much?
*  Right. So it's beautiful visually, but orally, you know, we create very complicated
*  things, which we call music, which are beautiful.
*  Yeah, that's a great question.
*  I don't know why music is beautiful.
*  People have made attempts, you know, there's things like sort of chirp sounds that might be
*  produced near a black hole and sort of ideas like this.
*  And you're right. They tend not to be all that beautiful.
*  The only ones that I can think of that sort of offhand, you know, it's being produced by
*  evolution. Birdsong is beautiful, but we're actually quite closely related to birds.
*  So it's maybe not so surprising.
*  If I think about things like what's his name, Ron, Ron Sexsmith, I think his name is a
*  composer in Toronto has made these musical pieces based on the different periods in the solar
*  system. So the time that the earth takes the one year to go around the sun, but also then Mars
*  and Jupiter and all these, and they are noticeably not particularly attractive musical pieces.
*  So, so yeah, that's a good question.
*  I wonder if the beauty of light isn't part of the reason for the beauty of the universe.
*  So as human beings, maybe we're evolved to be attracted to light.
*  It gives you an integrated theory of the beauty of the universe and beauty of paintings.
*  Vermeer, great painter, he's very attractive to people because of how he uses light.
*  When you look at the universe, you're typically seeing signatures of light.
*  In many cases, you look at the Milky Way, right?
*  It's pretty strange. I mean, we see in such a tiny, you know, band of wavelengths,
*  we're really not seeing almost anything. We're not seeing into the infrared and the radio.
*  We're not seeing into the ultraviolet and the X-ray. So a lot of what we view as beautiful
*  locally, I mean, it's got this sort of evolutionary explanation again, why the large scale structure
*  is beautiful. Okay. I can maybe attempt to sort of, I partially believe this explanation,
*  which is that we do seem to be sort of programmed to recognise and find attractive instinctively
*  novelty, which is associated to structure somehow. And so we look and we see spiral galaxies or
*  things like that. It's reflecting something, which is interesting. We don't necessarily know quite
*  what, but maybe there's kind of an evolutionary explanation for why that is attractive at least.
*  But I can apply that explanation to your question about sound. It's equally interesting
*  and equally as good. And unfortunately it just doesn't seem to hold there. So I'd be, I'm not
*  that confident. Now you've written that in the first half of your life, you typically were the
*  youngest person in your circle and that in the second half of your life, which is probably now
*  you're typically the oldest person in your circle. How would you model that as a claim about you?
*  I hope I'm in the first 5% of my life, but it's sadly unlikely. But say you're 50 now and you
*  100, right? Which is plausible. Which is plausible. And you would now be in the second half of your
*  life. Yeah. I mean, I can give shallow reasons. I can't give good reasons. The good reason in the
*  first half was so much of the work I was doing was kind of new fields of science. And those tend to
*  be dominated essentially for sort of almost sunk cost reasons. People who don't have any sunk costs
*  tend to be younger. They go into these fields. And so this kind of early days of quantum computing,
*  early days of open science, they were dominated by people in their twenties.
*  And then they'd sort of go off and become faculty members. They'd be the youngest person on the
*  faculty. Now, maybe it's just because I found sort of San Francisco and it's such an interesting
*  cultural institution or sort of achievement of civilization. We've got this amplifier for
*  25 year olds that lets them make dreams in the world. And that's for me anyway, for a person
*  with my personality, very attractive for many of the same reasons. Well, let's say you had a
*  theory of your collaborators and other than, yes, they're smart, they work hard, but trying to pin
*  down in as few dimensions as possible, who's likely to become a collaborator of yours after taking
*  into account the obvious. What's your theory of your own collaborators? They're all extremely open
*  to experience. They're all extremely curious. They're all extremely pro-social. They're all
*  extremely ambitious. They're all extremely imaginative. And do you think that ends up
*  pairing you with collaborators who are more different than you? So a lot of collaborators
*  are very similar and then other types are very different. So almost always as well, I will select
*  for somebody who has at least one very strong skill, which I do not have. And that's sort of
*  enough diversity from my point of view. And that may account for some of the age differences
*  Yeah, sure. But also then there's also just this local selection effect when I live in the Bay
*  area. There's a lot of really amazing 29 year olds around and it's just incredible.
*  I was told to ask, what's the influence of Simone Weill on you?
*  Oh, what an interesting question. She's one of the maybe the best examples of sincerity
*  that I know of. The fact that she wrote what she wrote for herself, she wasn't attempting to
*  get published. It was just this deep internal colloquy that was going on. And it's reflected
*  in every aspect of her life. She went off to fight in Spain at a time when women did not go off to
*  fight in Spain. She did all these, everything that she did, she did at 500 miles an hour is really,
*  she's remarkable as kind of, she's an extreme, very extreme type of a human being in a way that
*  I find very interesting. If you and she collaborated, what would it be on?
*  I don't think, I'm sure she was a difficult person. Although her brother Andre Weill was a
*  very great mathematician and you can sort of see in some of the stories about the two of them
*  that she must have quite liked the sort of scientist types. Maybe we would have found
*  something to collaborate on. Why is Charles Sanders Perce
*  still an important thinker? I don't know enough about
*  P.S. to be able to answer that question. You and I were both fans of Olaf Stapleton,
*  who wrote the dual classics, Last and First Men and Star Maker. What's the biggest analytical
*  mistake he made in those narratives? So a lot of implausible things happen, right? But those are
*  too simple to point to. Where is his understanding of the social world going wrong? You know, he was
*  both to certainly to some degree a socialist and certainly a pacifist. Though in World War II,
*  he switched out of pacifism. He did, as did many people. I find myself as I read those
*  books actually becoming a little bit more sympathetic. I'm not a priori particularly
*  sympathetic to them. And I start to think, here's this very long view of history. I mean,
*  much longer than most people who say they have a long view of history. And I think he sort of he
*  sees some of his pacifism in that light. It's kind of questions about, you know, what's actually good
*  for a species or in fact, not even a single species, but across multiple species. Is it good
*  to be pacifist? And there's a really interesting point of view. It's hard to reconcile with kind
*  of a selfish gene kind of a point of view. But of course, this is an ongoing problem in evolutionary
*  biology. It actually seems like, you know, group selection doesn't quite work, but something at
*  that level there has to be a little bit true. So if you take that seriously, then maybe his pacifism,
*  which just seems like a sort of an outright mistake. Maybe it's actually justifiable
*  in some way. Actually, I'm not answering. I've answered the inverse of your question,
*  which is to justify the bits that I, a priori, find most implausible. But yeah, I think those
*  are mistakes. I worry that he too quickly assumes collective action problems are solved, which is
*  close to your answer. So he thinks the League of Nations can be effective for a long period of time,
*  which I suspect was not really contingently possible. And he has this Hegelian sense,
*  what Hegel would call a national spirit. For him is a civilizational or certain stage of man spirit
*  that so shapes how people think. And I hang out with a lot of economists. I think that's much
*  stronger than the economists believe your overall view of the world and what's important. But I
*  don't think it's nearly as strong as Stapleton believed. So the way in which collective spirit
*  rules millions, billions or trillions of beings, I feel he's overestimating the efficacy of that.
*  Yeah. I, the comment about the League of Nations is really interesting. I think, you know, there's
*  this spirit at the time, lots of people wanted this idea to work. Lots of his friends would have
*  wanted it. I think it's a sort of a shallow kind of a mistake that he made there. That your comment
*  about collective action problems seems much more to the heart of it. I think he didn't really
*  believe in them or actually sort of understand just how difficult they are to solve, how difficult
*  to supply public goods and these kinds of things. He always does away with it sort of narratively.
*  It's assumed away without really a mechanism being given. And he assumes a lot away in those books.
*  But when the problems are interesting, he usually doesn't. And that problem is interesting and he
*  still assumes it away. I'm not very sympathetic to that at all. I'm not sure how big a mistake
*  League of Nations was. So clearly it didn't work and I just criticized him for it. But if you think
*  about 1815 up through the First World War, almost a century, you have an unprecedented degree of
*  peace in much, not all of Europe. And everyone has just lived through that and they maybe thought
*  that was not possible. And maybe that is itself still a bit of a mystery. And then there's World
*  War I and you feel you can get back to some version of what you had. And the League of Nations appears
*  to be the closest path to doing that. And it might have been more plausible at the time.
*  1. I'm just saying there's a gap between aspiration and what actually happened.
*  With the League and then later with the United Nations. I think all the, you had the hopes and
*  then you had what actually happened. There's a very large gap. Although I mean, of course,
*  as prototypes over the next few centuries, maybe these things are terrific. Maybe we learn a lot
*  from them. Things like, I don't know, the Montreal Protocol have been possible without the United
*  Nations, probably not. 2. I have a very concrete question for you. And this is to clear up a
*  confusion of mine. So I've asked experts in quantum computing, what's the status of quantum
*  computing right now? Some of them say we already have it. Some of them say the others will tell
*  you we already have it, but we don't. Others will say we're on the verge of having it. And there's
*  two or three other answers I hear, often people who nominally would seem to know what they're
*  talking about. So let me ask you, Michael, what is actually the status of quantum computing right now?
*  I am the wrong person. I am determinedly very agnostic about this. I stopped, I worked on it
*  from 1992 to 2007. And actually I do keep up with friends. In fact, I'm going to have a coffee after
*  this with somebody who's still on the quantum train. But I don't, impressive is, it's very
*  impressive progress each year. It is an extremely difficult problem. It's not solved. There's no way
*  it's definitely not solved. But the fact that there's sort of order a hundred qubit systems,
*  which you can apparently manipulate as you will suggest to me, we just wait. It's going to happen.
*  We don't know what it will mean. What's your maximum likelihood estimate
*  for the first year when it will do something useful?
*  Useful to me or useful to civilization?
*  Useful to anyone.
*  And the most interesting thing would be to discover that quantum mechanics was wrong.
*  From my point of view, the other most interesting thing is probably discovery of new materials.
*  How would it discover new materials?
*  Just by being able to do simulations very, very rapidly. It's very hard to do simulations of
*  stuff down at the quantum scale. The ones that we have are pretty terrible. But it's very, very
*  the quantum scale. The ones that we have are pretty terrible and often produce wrong results.
*  The fact that we may actually have a very high throughput way of doing lots and lots of
*  simulations, which give correct results. It's like being able to do a thousand times as many
*  experiments as before. That will just speed things up in so far as there's anything to discover. I
*  can't tell you what we'll discover.
*  Will there be quantum money? Will all money be quantum money in this world whenever it comes?
*  I actually don't know. I mean, there's this whole idea of Steven Vizner, which he called quantum
*  money. It's meant to be uncounterfeitable. I don't know.
*  But isn't everything else counterfeitable if quantum computing is up and running? And thus
*  you need a quantum money to protect against just your counterfeiting. Most of the 19th century
*  monies, they were often counterfeit. We don't know the exact percentage, but we believe it was quite
*  high.
*  Yeah. Well, it's still true in the world today, nevermind the 19th century, as we've talked about
*  before. I won't be surprised if we end up with systems like that. It's hard to make it stable.
*  That's the issue. But my guess is that in the long run, we actually will find ways of making
*  quantum systems surprisingly stable. That's speculation on my part, but if I come back in
*  a hundred years time, and that's true, we may just have quantum coherence everywhere.
*  Do you think that leads to a mass privatization of a lot of social activity? So something like AI,
*  we're in San Francisco, the private sector does it. No government is really close to doing it,
*  right? You have to pay high salaries, hire the most talented people. So if AI and quantum computing
*  are done by the private sector, what is government in that world?
*  I don't know. I mean, it's an interesting fact that work on nuclear weapons was actually
*  nationalized in I think 1948 or something like that. So potentially that's just one answer,
*  right? Sort of contingently.
*  But that seems more of a brute force thing than what I say open AI has done.
*  I'm just saying that that's a potential outcome. I think quite a plausible potential outcome. I
*  don't think it's likely, but it's not 99% unlikely either. Yeah, I mean, that's certainly,
*  it's kind of a very Neil Postman point of view. You have this basically, you almost Larry Lasek,
*  code is law. You just keep building more and more sort of governance infrastructure into the
*  technology and you're moving it out of the hands of the population and into the technology. And
*  that seems to be certainly the story of the last hundred years and very likely the story of the
*  next hundred years. Is the status of linear algebra rising?
*  That's a great question. It probably has. Yeah.
*  It's prominent in quantum, right? It's prominent in AI.
*  Google is built on, you know, magic's multiplication. You know, it's prominent for a lot of reasons.
*  Well, what should we infer from that about the whole nature of the world?
*  So if differential equations were rising in status to a similar degree, we might
*  infer one set of things, but linear algebra, you almost feel a bit more grounded, don't you?
*  Because when I took that class, I felt I understood it.
*  I never quite know what your status questions mean,
*  Tyler. I don't know what it means for something to rise in status.
*  Well, AI now seems more important than it did five years ago. And matrix multiplication is a big part
*  of that. If quantum computing happens, as you're predicting it will, well, that I think would also
*  make matrix algebra rise in status. Like, oh, this is a really important tool. It's behind all our
*  quantum money. Do you mean it's going to have more money go to it, more power go to it, more glamour
*  go to it? Are people going to regard this as sexy or what? All of those. But you would revise your
*  ideas about the fundamental nature of the universe. Just like our current understand
*  of quantum mechanics. It might be incorrect, but at least in the short run, it seems like
*  probability theory is somehow more important than Einstein might've thought. And as you know,
*  he famously asserted God is not playing dice with the universe, perhaps incorrectly.
*  I mean, the people who remake this understanding are very good at ignoring status.
*  But others aren't.
*  But others aren't.
*  I think I'm inclined to think, I mean, maybe I don't care. I actually just don't care that much.
*  I mean, if you're searching for comparative advantage and doing creative work,
*  you want to know where status is, but mostly so you can avoid it.
*  Yeah, absolutely. Be short status, as Peter D. likes to say.
*  Yeah, exactly. That's it. It's well put. Yeah.
*  Is there any chance Roger Penrose is right and the human brain is some kind of quantum computer?
*  I would love it if he was right. I think the answer unfortunately is not really.
*  It's only possible that there's some very interesting structure in there that is quantum
*  mechanical in some really interesting way. I mean, lots of structure in there is quantum
*  mechanical. The reason why atoms are stable has to do with quantum mechanics, like all these sorts
*  of things. But like an interesting unsuspected way would be, that would be terrific. And I think it's
*  not completely out of the question, but it probably doesn't affect anything about consciousness or
*  anything like that. I would be very surprised if that were the case.
*  How are we going to make progress toward a theory of quantum gravity,
*  a general understanding of everything? We seem to be stuck. Many people hate string theory.
*  Many people hate ever at many worlds. Those seem to be two major contenders.
*  Where are we at and what's going to happen next?
*  One fun reason for working on quantum computing is you're trying to build the largest scale,
*  fully quantum coherent systems that have ever been built. Whenever you push on into a new regime
*  like that, there's some chance that things break down. If something was to break down there,
*  that would be fantastic. Because we'd learn a lot.
*  Because we'd learn a lot. And that's kind of what, the problem in some ways in physics has been that
*  the fundamental theories have been just too successful for the last 50 years. Yes, you're
*  right again is very attractive for sort of a few years, but over 50 or 60 years, it's terrible.
*  And I think that's certainly part of the issue with quantum gravity.
*  Does it bother you that so many people hate string theory, think it's now low status,
*  think it's not aesthetic, think it's unintuitive? Does that carry any weight with you or do you want
*  to be like short status again on this one? I mean, there's the question of inside and outside.
*  Well, there's a question of inside and outside the profession. There's also the question of
*  inside and outside the group of people who know something. And those two are not exactly the same
*  group, but there's a lot of overlap. So I mean, outside, it affects funding a little bit. Well,
*  actually maybe quite a bit. And so in that sense, it matters. But internally, I think
*  I'm more interested in the question of just how much diversity of opinion is there. Are people
*  pursuing lots of different ideas? One of the things that I've noticed over many years is I
*  find mathematicians when I talk to them, it's such a healthy culture because each mathematician is
*  really, well, a lot of them are very unique. They've got their own sort of particular path
*  and their set of beliefs. Physics, theoretical physics often seems just a little bit more
*  monotone that can sum themselves up in a few words when they're talking to their professional
*  colleagues. And that's not so healthy. So I'm really not so interested in the question you asked.
*  I'm much more interested in the question of how do you generate that kind of diversity?
*  And do you feel that ultimately the final theory of a universe or metaverse ought to be simple?
*  Who's declaring aught here?
*  But when someone presents a theory to you, do you ever say, no, that's too complicated. It might be
*  an intermediate theory at some level, but it's not going to be the final theory. Because I hear this
*  for many people, a lack of satisfaction. You won't surprise. I mean, it's the same when I've,
*  you know, the little tiny pieces of economics I've learned when I hear about, I don't know,
*  Ricardian comparative advantage or something like this. There's just a nice little element of
*  surprise. You're getting a free lunch somehow. So I'm more interested in that than I am maybe
*  in the question of simplicity. What makes for physicists who age well?
*  I spent quite a bit of time thinking about this as actually in my late 20s and went to look and see
*  what seemed to distinguish older physicists who had aged well and older physicists who had
*  maybe gotten a bit too complacent. As far as I could tell, having younger mentors
*  was really the key. And why is that important?
*  I don't know. I mean, I have theories. This was an empirical observation.
*  Yeah. But what's your best theory? What I think is probably the case,
*  it's almost a network effect. Basically, if there is some slight sort of downhill
*  slide and most of your friends, you know, are not quite at the edge anymore, that's going to infect
*  you. But if you still have mentors who are 25, 28, extremely active, and they're active in the
*  latest ways, you get to partake of kind of the positive network effects. And so I think
*  that's why it's very important not just to have, not to have people who work for you.
*  Lots of 70 year old physicists have 23 year old students, but actually to have 23 year olds,
*  28 year olds who you really learn from and you regard as your mentors.
*  And holding constant your degree of power and influence, what's the best way to attract
*  younger mentors? Find people whose work you admire and befriend them.
*  And you think that works pretty well? Yeah.
*  And just being nice? I'm not sure being nice is the right...
*  But you have a lot of younger mentors. You're known famously for being very nice,
*  right? So this is partly a question about your own self-awareness, but has you being very nice
*  helped you get more younger mentors or are they attracted to other aspects of you?
*  I am extremely disagreeable, but in a polite way, I hope, and a kind way, hopefully.
*  So you are very nice then? Well, people often find people who are
*  disagreeable actually quite difficult, but if you look at all of the younger mentors I've had in the
*  last, say, seven or eight years, they're all people who enjoy disagreement. They say the
*  thing that they think is obvious and you say, here's another way of looking at it. And they're
*  like, oh, they want to engage. Some people get insulted or they get threatened or they get
*  annoyed when you do that. And those people are not going to be good collaborators. They're not
*  going to be a match. As the years pass, do you think your
*  probability for God existing is going up or down? Do you mean...
*  Which type of God are you referring to here? Are you referring to like the Abrahamic God or what?
*  No, not a particular religion, but some explanation that would seem to stand
*  prior to and outside of what we call physics and would be mystical in some way.
*  It's been... That hasn't changed since I was seven years old.
*  But that's weird that it hasn't changed, right? Why shouldn't... You've learned a lot. Why
*  shouldn't it change in whichever direction? I suppose I learned... I had explained to me
*  three basic theories of cosmology when I was seven, one of which was the Big Bang. And then there
*  were two others, which the Steady State Theory and a third whose name I don't even remember anymore.
*  And they leave some questions unanswered. Why is there anything? But as far as I can tell,
*  we haven't made any progress on sort of those things in the 40 odd years since.
*  Yeah, it's frustrating actually that that's the case. I mean, I think you're correct to say,
*  you've learned a lot. Why haven't you changed? And my response to that is I've learned a lot.
*  Gosh, it's really annoying that I haven't... That it hasn't impacted that question more.
*  I think my P has gone up a modest amount over time. So when I was saying in my young 20s,
*  I thought physics was going to make more progress than it has at fundamental theoretical levels.
*  And the fact that it hasn't, it nudges me a bit to wonder, well, these other types of explanations
*  that I was not so keen on, maybe they're a bit more important than I had thought.
*  That hasn't happened with you? No. The thing that's an interesting... It hasn't really. I think
*  I just don't think 40 years is very long. If it had been 100,000 years, I'd...
*  But it's all I've got in a sense. I mean, I'm going to have a bit more, but...
*  Hopefully, yes. My opinion time span is going to be 40 plus something.
*  I think my appreciation for God has gone way up. I appreciate the construction of the religions far
*  more than I did. What sort of notions of God do for people, I'm vastly more appreciative.
*  But my probability, I don't think has really changed.
*  And what about evolutionary frameworks where there's some Darwinian process,
*  some kinds of universes within a broader metaverse, they reproduce at greater frequencies,
*  that shapes the properties of what we live in. Isn't that a kind of substitute
*  for a good explanation and that rises in probability just a bit?
*  No. I mean... Why not?
*  It's... You're relabeling what you mean by universe. If you just sort of use a term that
*  means everything that is, then that hasn't changed. Our model of what it might be has
*  potentially changed quite a bit over the last few decades. But the...
*  But maybe there's a simple theory for the metaverse, but we can never ever see it.
*  It's like Gnostic religion. And then our own universe, there's not a simple theory,
*  but we do know the parameter values we got are enough to drag it across the finish line.
*  And that takes some of the burden off physics in a way. Just like, well, the platypus, it seems
*  an unlikely creature, but it has in fact survived.
*  Okay. You're just sort of saying that...
*  The universe is like a platypus.
*  Some of the things that seem arbitrary.
*  And being a good Australian, you appreciate the platypus, right?
*  Appreciate the platypus quite a bit. It's good for fooling,
*  visiting Americans about whether or not this animal can exist or not.
*  Yes.
*  I still don't find that compelling. I think because there's always...
*  We've always known that there seems likely to be fairly contingent facts about the universe.
*  I mean, it shifts the level at which they are. It's more interesting
*  if the value of the fine structure constant is actually a contingent fact.
*  That is interesting. Or if some of the other couple of constants are
*  changing over time or sort of models like this. But it's not particularly...
*  It's still not getting at the essential question from my point of view. I mean,
*  why is there something rather than nothing?
*  That I've long thought is an impossible question.
*  So we might have theories of parameter values or be able to predict how things interact or
*  what happened a long time ago. But the Heideggerian question, I don't think it's a meaningful question
*  at all because the word why is already embedded in some context, which it sends a self-undercutting
*  query. Open science, why do some fields have preprint platforms and others not? Is there
*  an actual regularity or is that random and path dependent? I think a lot of that probably comes
*  down to individuals. One of my favorite things, years ago, before they'd started to spread in
*  biology, I would often ask physicists and biologists this question. Why is there preprints in physics
*  but not in biology? And the biologists would say, well, biology is so much more competitive than
*  physics that we can't possibly bear to share our results too early. And the physicists would say,
*  physics is so much more competitive than biology that we have to share them as rapidly as possible
*  to get the word out. But with COVID, didn't biology go the route... At least some parts of biology go
*  the route of physics? And it just seems like it's just a cultural problem. It turns out it's a little
*  bit more like fashion or something like that. It does need to be solved. If you look at what
*  was done in the early days of the physics preprint server, some very clever things, actually things
*  which are reflected in some of my favorite economists, some of their ideas were done by
*  Paul Ginsberg when he was starting up the preprint server. He went very narrow. He didn't try and
*  solve the problem all across all the fields. And he went and kind of twisted the arms at some level
*  of some very high status, high profile physicists to say, I would like you to use this service,
*  send me your best paper. So on the first day, what's his name? Andy Strominger, who I think is at
*  Harvard, and then was on the preprint server and Ed Whitten showed up very quickly. So these are
*  very prominent people and you get this sort of just, it's a tiny community, but then you can
*  agglomerate. You can start to attach other communities. But that was just, that's a very
*  contingent fact about history. It could have happened in some sub-discipline of biology as well.
*  AC Why does so many crummy journals survive? And they can be quite expensive. You might also have
*  to pay to publish in them. They seem terrible that if a good piece were in them, the journal would
*  not certify the piece. If anything, the piece would help certify the journal. Why can't we get out of that?
*  Yeah. I mean, there's a complicated set of things going on. One is that libraries pay not to
*  individuals usually for subscriptions. So they're not actually really the person getting the utility
*  is not the same as the person making the buying decision. That's always bad. There's also the
*  fact that since the 1990s and the rise of the internet, we get economies of scale. You don't
*  subscribe, libraries don't subscribe to individual journals for the most part. They subscribe to
*  all these giant bundles, which is actually a terrific idea at some level. It's a way of passing
*  on economies of scale and publication to the customers, but it does go some way to explaining
*  why these crummy journals persist. AC But you think in part libraries are inefficient at
*  capturing rents for themselves. Did they get this budget? They spend it on bad journals.
*  It might be better for the world if they just took the money home and bought ice cream, right?
*  AC Or did whatever. Yeah. There's many other things that could be done with that money.
*  It's difficult for them to reason about having talked to many librarians. They will do things
*  like they will use impact factor. I mean, that's the differentiator that they tend to use. So
*  they'll try and get all impact journal, impact factor, whatever it is, and above journals.
*  That's the kind of the way they seem to think. They're just using a very imperfect proxy. They
*  understand as well as anybody that their proxy is imperfect, but they don't have anything better to
*  do as far as I can tell. It's a very unfortunate situation.
*  AC And right now, how high are the marginal returns to greater openness?
*  So put aside terrorists manufacturing new pathogens, put aside people figuring out how
*  to make their own nuclear weapons, AI problems. So putting aside the very negative, just if the
*  good stuff were more open, how much more rapidly would science progress?
*  AC Openness per se, I mean, that's a very weak word. You need to be sort of much more specific.
*  If you look at, say, the culture around Jupyter notebooks in machine learning,
*  I think having those very openly available and widely available really has driven a lot of
*  progress. You can just write your Jupyter notebook with your experiment. You make it available to
*  other people and that can really drive a lot of progress. It's not the same as making your journal
*  article openly available. It's a much more active kind of a material. Do I think that that is an
*  important component in really significantly speeding up science? Yes. But it's not-
*  AC It's not going to be 2X.
*  AC I think that there's much larger than 2X possible and this is a small, this is a piece of that.
*  AC Yeah. But it's not 2X on its own.
*  AC No, it's actually, it's too undefined a term. Openness is always with respect to what platform,
*  with respect to what set of institutions, with respect to what set of norms. With the current
*  sets of norms and institutions that we have, it buys you a little bit. I don't think it buys you
*  that much. But the norms and institutions, they're going to change in response. The way in which
*  people work will change in response. I mean, the Jupyter notebook example I gave is, I think,
*  a good example of that. AC Why are science textbooks so expensive?
*  Is it marginal cost? Is it third party payment problems? Is it something else?
*  AC I don't know. AC Is it instructor lock-in because
*  the notes are geared to the text they've worked with for 15 years?
*  AC Yeah. Very few professors make that much money from the textbooks that they write. But
*  they're often very protective. I see people complaining on Twitter that they're not going
*  to get the $400 check next year for their textbook under a new open access policy.
*  And they're really up in arms about this $400. That's interesting. It's hard for me to empathize
*  with psychologically. I don't understand. I mean, a priori, I wrote this Neural Nets textbook,
*  which I put online for free. And that massively, I mean, that's really made a really large difference
*  to the impact which it's had. In fact, even if I just think purely financially, I wasn't doing it
*  and thinking, oh, financially, this will be better off. But the greater impact has actually
*  benefited me much more financially than any amount of royalties ever would.
*  AC You mean like giving talks or being invited? AC Yeah. And just in general, people know
*  who you are, what you've done, what you're interested in, and they're much more likely
*  to provide all sorts of different opportunities, including jobs. So I think from the point of view
*  of the authors, it really actually doesn't make that much sense. From the point of view
*  of the publishers, though, it might make more sense. I mean, the textbook market is not huge,
*  but it is multi-billions. AC You have a well-known article with
*  Patrick Ollison on progress in science slowing down. And it's published at a point, say, right
*  before mRNA vaccines, right before GPT-4, other developments. How well can we know the progress
*  of science at any point in time? Isn't there often an everything all at once effect? And in fact,
*  those years we were building up and investing in things that very suddenly then flourished?
*  AC Yeah. It's amusing to think about different points at time, which you could try and write
*  the same article. Probably the years before the Principia, you would have been able to do the same
*  thing. There is some question about what certain types of institution make possible. Actually,
*  I don't know. I think really the high of a bid in my response is going to be something like,
*  I just think AI is not yet 100% clear, but I think it's very likely to drive a lot of scientific
*  progress over the next few years. And that's just a case of, we're moving all of our, so much of our
*  cognition and eventually also the actuators, the way we operate in the world out into these devices
*  where all of a sudden it becomes much more mutable and hopefully improvable.
*  RK Do you think the private sector wages of scientists are a good proxy for progress in science?
*  If science is declining in value, you would think scientists would be paid less and less,
*  but over the last 40 years, mostly those wages haven't fallen.
*  MG I don't think it's a good, I mean, you know,
*  Isaac Newton wasn't the richest person to ever live, but he probably did more for human understanding.
*  RK But there's more of a market now. The Isaac Newton of today would probably be pretty wealthy.
*  Einstein could have been wealthy had he done more media, right?
*  MG But he wouldn't have been wealthy for what he did well.
*  RK But still, his wage would have reflected
*  his fame. He could have endorsed, you know, ski boots and other things.
*  MG Famously, he asked for $3,000 a year when he moved to the IAS and they gave him 15.
*  So I think he wasn't very good at negotiating. RK But just say that the wages for private sector
*  pharma scientists, they seem to go up for quite a while. When the drug pipeline seemed slow,
*  should we have inferred from that? Well, we're building up to some big things, some blockbusters
*  or not? MG Yeah. This is a question for you,
*  Tyler. It's not a question for me. RK Well, that's why I'm asking you.
*  MG Right. Good reason to do so. I think I'm inclined to think.
*  And there's always this interesting balance. Actually, AI is a really interesting example
*  at this point in time. There's this theory, which has become widely believed by almost everybody,
*  that scaling is very important. Scaling is a very capital friendly story. So it actually moves some
*  of the power, the negotiating power from individual researchers, I think, to the centers of capital.
*  But it is just a story. I think it's quite interesting that it, in some sense,
*  gives the individual researchers less negotiating power. Whether or not
*  this is going to eventually result in a diminished ability to build personal brands
*  and then capture value from that, I don't know. I'm really interested actually to see what will
*  happen over the next few years. It used to be that the big companies published a lot of papers
*  very openly and that is gradually going away. And as that goes away, it damages the individual
*  researchers because they're not able to build their brands publicly in that way. They're not
*  as easily able to say, I am the person who did. RK But this is a small city. Doesn't everyone know?
*  I had dinner with a bunch of AI researchers last night. They all seemed to know each other's
*  relative importance. And you look at their salaries. So there's rumors.
*  RK They're doing fine. RK That top researchers
*  can be offered five to $10 million a year. Those must be some of the highest science salaries ever.
*  And you're saying AI is such a big thing. You seem to be coming down on the side of the wages
*  predicting something. RK I think actually, I mean, they're all, yeah,
*  I think so much money is going in and it's going in on the basis of brand to some extent.
*  We've hired such and such a person who did such and such a thing. And if that can make your
*  company valuation go up by a few hundred million dollars, then offering them another extra million
*  dollars a year makes sense. But I don't have a grand, this is all local storytelling. It's
*  not grand theory of what's actually going on. I haven't thought it through in enough detail
*  to have any confidence there. RK And now you're working on what I think you call the vulnerable
*  world hypothesis. Yes. RK That's what I think Bostrom. Yeah, that's his term.
*  RK What do you think is the cost at which a nuclear weapon could destroy a city? So if that costs
*  only $50,000, it seems to me the world's in big, big trouble pretty quickly. What's that cost level
*  where you get very, very nervous? So if it's $10 billion, maybe things are fairly safe. If it's 50k,
*  we're done for. What's the threshold? RK The cost and expertise, but let's say the
*  expertise is comparable. So somebody who has 50k is probably able to get the expertise as well.
*  Yeah, that's not great. RK That's my fundamental worry,
*  with or without AI, that just that cost becomes low. RK Honestly, I mean, there's some question
*  about what exactly you mean by nuclear weapon. Like, is it portable? Is it... RK It would render
*  a mid-sized city uninhabitable for a few decades, at the very least. RK Sort of a multi-megaton,
*  but not... RK It would make the headlines. RK It would make the headlines. A very small nuclear
*  bomb will make the headlines if detonated. Yeah, I mean, if we're getting down to hundreds of
*  thousands of dollars. The thing is, the issue is right. Nuclear weapons are terrible, but they're
*  not civilization-threatening directly. RK Sure, but enough of these go off. Life as we know it
*  is over. RK They can certainly be destabilizing. That's... RK It would be like the fall of the
*  Roman Empire, maybe worse. RK Yeah, that's what it starts to seem like.
*  RK But in what year do you think that the cost will be low enough that that happens?
*  RK I mean, at this point, I don't have a good sense. I suppose I'm actually more concerned
*  about other threats. RK But if this is a... RK Fire safety is the obvious thing.
*  RK I wouldn't call it a certain threat, but if you simply think technology will advance...
*  RK Here's the thing. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty means that we actually have a lot of
*  controls of the ability to produce fissile material. RK But that's like League of Nations,
*  right, ultimately? RK Yeah, I mean, it is. It's really coming out of that same... We have this
*  cartel of whatever it is, 10 countries or something. RK It'll fail when the cost is low.
*  RK It will eventually fail, but that's many decades away.
*  RK But do you have reason to think we're going to last a thousand years in a civilized state? Not
*  every person dead, but... RK I think getting off planet Earth and
*  establishing a civilization elsewhere is very, very important. Yeah. Very hard for economic reasons,
*  but utterly crucial. RK Robots, in a sense, make it harder because you could send robots to Mars
*  to do whatever might be economically useful there. Means you never work hard on having humans do it.
*  RK Yeah, that's true. I mean, we're pretty curious.
*  RK But the robot will take perfect footage. Whatever is there, the robot will send back to us.
*  You'll have your whatever is the current version of Apple Vision Pro on, right? It will seem very
*  realistic. RK You're an economist. I'm a romantic, I think. It might be the difference.
*  RK But we'd have to settle them at scale. So 20 people on Mars limping along.
*  RK Oh, we're talking about like a million people, not 20 people.
*  RK But if we can do a million, we can do a billion, I would think.
*  RK Sure, sure, sure. I'm saying you want to get, you know, it's still not going to be,
*  it's not going to be self, what's the right term? It's not going to be an autarky or whatever the
*  right term is. It's not going to be completely self-sustaining, but at a million people,
*  it has a lot of the civilizational infrastructure. And so I think that's the right sort of scale.
*  Casey Hanmer is a nice book. I think it's, you know, How to Build a City of a Million People on
*  Mars or something like that, which I think is, it's way too optimistic in many of its
*  assumptions, but he's got the right scale. RK Economics aside, what's the main
*  scientific constraint that has to be overcome? Is it gravity? Is it effective radiation on the
*  human body? Is it water? RK I mean, to some extent, we're not going to know until we go.
*  There was this great experiment done a few years ago where there was a pair of twins. One went up
*  into space for a year. The other one stayed on earth. And so that was the first time we actually
*  got to do a controlled, somewhat controlled study where we see what the impact of being in
*  space for a long period of time does to a human body. And I mean, they just discovered so many
*  things. This is still below the Van Allen belts as well. So we don't, I mean, we just don't know
*  the answer to those questions. There's a whole bunch of problems. The regolith on Mars is terrible
*  for human beings. I'm sure that the low gravity is going to be bad for them. What else is this?
*  There's shortages of, there's nitrogen, fortunately, which we don't really have on the
*  moon. RK So you're making me think civilization as we know it won't last a thousand years.
*  RK Yeah, I think that's a no, I also have a lot of, I guess, faith in long run economic growth.
*  Basically at the moment for us to go to Mars is, you know, very, very, very expensive given the
*  return or to establish a permanent human presence in space. If we continue to have economic growth,
*  relative cost is just going to keep going down. At some point it's actually not going to be that
*  difficult. RK Does a vulnerable world mean near universal surveillance?
*  RK Unfortunately, I think probably yes. RK Doesn't that then become the great point
*  of vulnerability? RK Oh, absolutely. Yeah, it's hard.
*  RK If you could ban universal surveillance from here on out forever, would you press that button?
*  RK No, I mean, I think, you know, the history of justice to some extent,
*  the term surveillance, it's funny, you know, it has negative connotations. People, you know,
*  they think of Bentham and the Panopticon and the Gulag Archipelago and the Stasi and all these things.
*  But in fact, our ability to supply justice is dependent upon having a good understanding
*  of what has occurred in the present and in the past. So to the extent-
*  RK But maybe it needs opaqueness as well. It's this optimal mix of surveillance and opaqueness
*  that you actually have some latitude to break certain laws, to misbehave,
*  that keeps the system stable, limits the abuses of power,
*  limits how much power the powerful have over us.
*  RK Yeah, there has to be some sort of Madisonian point of view where you're bringing the powerful
*  institutions into conflict with each other. We do that very imperfectly at the moment,
*  you know, ideas like search warrants and things like this. They're supposed to be checks and
*  balances, but it seems like the organisations which do the surveillance are too powerful.
*  They don't have a strong enough, you know, a strong enough foundation to do the surveillance.
*  Checks on them. I don't know whether, you know, just as a practical matter,
*  the United States is capable of doing this well. I'd be much more comfortable if it was
*  in other countries. RK And a strong AI future, where do the economies of scale lie?
*  Say within your lifetime, not 500 years from now. There'll be one company, there'll be one chipmaker.
*  MG What are you pointing to? RK Well, we're all trying to figure out
*  how AI will shape the future, right? So one model is everything is supplied competitively,
*  maybe a bit like fast food today. I suspect that's not true, but it could be true.
*  There's the oligopoly model, there's the one company races ahead of the others,
*  and then its own AI does R&D at an accelerated pace and they stay ahead forever.
*  Or there's one country, one company, you want something, controls all the chips.
*  Where do you see the monopoly power evolving? Because it's essential, I think,
*  to the predictions of the model. MG When I talk to people who know much
*  more than I do, they all point at ASML as having been surprisingly hard to duplicate.
*  Just the ability to sometimes do the lithography, but do the lithography at scale,
*  which seems to be very, very hard. RK So we should be long Netherlands.
*  MG Probably. Yeah. RK Yeah. That would be an amazing conclusion.
*  MG It would be an amazing conclusion, but return to the Dutch Renaissance.
*  RK So it's like agriculture and lithography, drawing on 17th century strengths.
*  MG Human services, maybe. RK That's right.
*  MG Yeah, yeah, yeah. RK The return of Vermeer.
*  MG Yeah, yeah. What do you think of the Netherlands as a country?
*  RK Oh, I love it. I've never spent, well, actually, I spent a month there once. Who am I kidding?
*  MG That's a lot of time. RK That's a fair amount of time in Leiden, actually.
*  RK It's a lovely place. It has many problems, of course. I mean, their altitude is not great.
*  In some ways, actually, in some ways, it's good. Yeah, they're an interesting sort of a test case.
*  They show what a strong, determined civilization can do in response to nature.
*  MG Yeah. I like the flatness of it. I like the water being everywhere. Not everywhere,
*  but most parts, at least of Western Netherlands. I find that very attractive.
*  RK There's this stereotype I sometimes encounter. People sort of view it as being a little
*  orderly. I've heard people say it's dull, but actually, I think some of the most
*  interesting experiences of my life were there. I went to a, it was like a jamboree in the field
*  a week, five days long, called Hacking at Random in 2011, where some people from Anonymous spoke,
*  a whole bunch of cryptographers spoke. It was really sort of hacker culture.
*  It was just intellectually wild in the most interesting way. It grew out of Dutch hacker
*  culture. I think there's a lot of, that spirit of the Dutch Renaissance is still visible.
*  MG How would you describe the quality of those conversations? What were they like?
*  Different than what's in San Francisco? RK Oh, yeah.
*  MG And how different, how are they different?
*  RK They're not captured by capital to the same extent.
*  Conversations in San Francisco, particularly with younger people,
*  tend to be extremely idealistic and often very pro-social. But then later there's this sort of
*  negotiation that goes on where they need access to capital to make their dreams come true.
*  A certain amount of compromise is made, although they also often keep a lot of their original
*  sort of pro-social and idealistic character. In the Netherlands, in those particular events,
*  there had been less of that. They also had less access to capital.
*  MG If someone's going to travel to the Netherlands, they have a tech background.
*  What should they do or what advice do you have for them? How should they try to learn more
*  from the Netherlands? RK It's been years since I've been there.
*  I'm not the right person. MG But since you have good memory
*  through spaced repetition. RK Yeah, maybe. I mean, yeah, I love going to the museums in Amsterdam,
*  just partially. Rembrandt is maybe my favorite painter. It's hard actually to think of anything
*  else when I think of the Netherlands other than Rembrandt's late self-portraits,
*  which I think are some of the most extraordinary things ever done.
*  RK Let's say we all had better memories. How big is the social gain there? Is there any social gain
*  at all? So you've been an advocate of spaced repetition for improving your memory. It works
*  for medical students. It probably works for languages. But are there social gains,
*  especially with AI coming? RK I wouldn't say I was an advocate.
*  MG But you do it. RK I do it.
*  MG And you teach other people how to do it. RK I get benefits from it and some other people
*  get benefits from it. I'm very enthusiastic if they do. Lots of people try it and are like,
*  this isn't working for me. I will stop doing it. Same as if you listen to Bach and don't like it,
*  stop listening to Bach. To what extent do I think? There's a long sequence of papers trying to
*  elucidate the connection between deep practical expertise and the role of memory, I suppose,
*  most famously. People like Herb Simon and Anders Ericsson and people like this have tried to
*  understand what relationship, if any. It's a little bit murky. They all make very strong claims
*  about an expert as somebody who's acquired 50,000 chunks of information and things like this.
*  They're nice stories. They certainly seem to be born out, but I don't know what the causal thing
*  is. If I talk to you about economics, you can tell me, not just an astounding number of things
*  about economics, but about a lot of different things. But I don't know, are you an expert
*  because you know those things or is it downstream of something else? I'm sure it's part of it.
*  If you had a magic memory, it might help you a little bit. But I suspect actually it's downstream
*  of something else, your determination, curiosity, something like that.
*  AC There's some evidence that students learn better when they take notes of what's being said.
*  Do you feel there's something for some people with memory a bit similar, that until they have
*  memorized it, it's less real for them? I don't just mean that they remember it more, but the
*  initial impact somehow is created or defined by the later act of memorization. Like people who take
*  trips and until they photograph something, they don't feel they've seen it.
*  CB Yeah. In fact, they very likely didn't see it.
*  AC Perhaps, yeah.
*  CB It's part of the reason why I take photos. I will look more closely. That seems to be
*  I mean, it's part of the reason I will take notes. It is part of the reason why I do spaced
*  repetition. It provides me with another way of paying attention to the world.
*  AC At some margins.
*  CB Those things are very valuable, right? Any general purpose strategy you have,
*  which will cause you to pay attention to the world, is incredibly valuable. And so I collect
*  things like that. Why did I say yes to coming on the podcast? A huge part of it is because I know
*  it's going to make me pay attention in different ways. I know that you're going to ask me questions
*  that nobody else is going to ask me. And so for me, like the reason I do spaced repetition and the
*  reason I will come on a podcast with somebody like you who asks very interesting questions,
*  it's kind of the same.
*  AC But in some other ways, you're a fan of non-legibility, as am I, at other margins.
*  And there's some tension because when you take the photo, when you remember something,
*  when you write it down, there's less legibility. And how-
*  There's no tension at all there. You're constantly expanding the legible. And when you do that,
*  there's this sort of penumbra of illegibility that surrounds it. That moves, but it gives you
*  access to those other spaces. You go to the Netherlands, you travel in general, you make
*  more of the world's culture, you make people much more legible to yourself, but that expands what
*  you're able to see as well at the edge of that. That's part of the reason for doing it. That's
*  part of the reason for wanting to make things legible. AC What's underrated about travel other
*  than that? AC Oh my God, almost everything. You denied saying this, but somebody once said to me
*  that travel is the only education. And it's really stayed with me as expressing some deep truth. I
*  think mostly just the world is so incredibly deep. AC Absolutely. AC There's whatever,
*  there's 8 billion people. AC It's the only way to see that depth and breadth.
*  AC Yeah. And it's just unbelievable. I mean, you pick almost a random person anywhere,
*  and you could spend a great year with them just learning things. And you can't unfortunately do
*  that 8 billion times. But yes, it's very, very underrated. It's been very underrated in my life.
*  I haven't traveled nearly as much as I should. AC Why is the midway aircraft carrier? Why is
*  that so interesting? AC There are many reasons. AC That's in San Diego, right? AC It is. Yeah.
*  So for about 10 years, it was probably the most dangerous object in the world.
*  It carried nuclear weapons, I believe. Having 5,000 people on it, basically you have,
*  people have been making objects like that for centuries, many centuries. They keep getting
*  better at it. There's so much sort of built knowledge built into that environment. It
*  expresses so much very deep expertise. And then you have four, four and a half thousand people,
*  all completely dedicated to a single purpose. They all care an enormous amount about this purpose.
*  They don't suffer like large organizations have all kinds of bloat and all kinds of problems.
*  So many of those problems have gone away there, but partially because when you're on a boat,
*  it's not so easy to empire build. Like there's real reasons to trim fat.
*  You have amazing sort of unity of purpose, what the captain or what the Admiral, there was both
*  on the boat say that that goes, you know, you're not arguing about what the right corporate strategy
*  is. So you have incredible clarity. You have incredible belief in this purpose. It actually
*  is a high purpose in their case, you're talking to some of the sailors, you know, they felt very
*  strongly that they were protecting a civilization that they cared about a great deal. You know,
*  they speak with so much pride about it. So it's almost sort of the perfect
*  floating civilization in some regards. It's just immensely interesting.
*  Here's something you once wrote and I quote, the great talent identifiers I know or know of all
*  seem very idiosyncratic. They're rather like Michelin chefs. This is getting us back to the
*  tension between the opaque and the legible. Why do you think that's true that they're idiosyncratic?
*  Actually, it's just because the boundaries of knowledge at any given time tend to be
*  idiosyncratic almost by definition. Like they haven't been commoditized yet. There is a best
*  person at making superconducting circuits in the world. There is a best person.
*  Thomas Schelling, I think was your PhD supervisor.
*  Yes.
*  When you read Schelling, you realize that some of the things he did, he did very well and he
*  must have been remarkable to talk to him, but he's a little bit illegible.
*  That's right.
*  Even though he's a very, very...
*  And he was when you would speak to him as well.
*  I'll bet he was, yeah. But that's the part of the value. You're like, oh,
*  this person is actually out on the edge of civilization. And I think that people who are
*  good at identifying people who are able to expand boundaries like that, they need to have some sense
*  of that edge.
*  And here's a question you wanted me to ask you. Quote, you initially were skeptical of
*  Emergent Ventures, but you've changed your mind and become enthusiastic about it. What caused the
*  switch and what would you change about Emergent Ventures?
*  I mean, the biggest single thing is just empirical. I've met a bunch of EV grantees. I've
*  encouraged a bunch of people to apply, some of whom you've given grants to, and they're great.
*  Also, they were not... You have not funded the people... You haven't funded in the way I might
*  have expected. I was talking to somebody. I've actually forgotten who it is. And they clearly
*  had some sort of socialist, quite anti-libertarian ideas, and you've given them a grant. And I thought...
*  Might have been a mistake, of course.
*  So typically, Tyler, he's trying to figure out, do they actually believe in this idea? Do they
*  actually really care? And then you don't mind that they're certainly not coming to the Mercatus
*  Centre to carry forward the libertarian flag. And somehow...
*  I think seeing so many people who
*  are doing very worthwhile things, which have no or very little institutional chance of support,
*  being amplified, that I care about a great deal. And it seems like EV is one of the places that is
*  doing that the best. That really... Yeah.
*  What do you think we can do to attract more non-legible but excellent people?
*  Find other people like yourself. Well, they're going to be like you in this abstract way,
*  but actually very unlike you in other ways. I think about people like Stuart Brand and
*  people like that in the past who've just been wonderful at talent identification, but they're
*  not identifying the same kind of talent as you. To some extent, they become human marketplaces
*  as well. They're actually... They're at a crossroads. They're connecting people to opportunity.
*  Right. And that's a very special type of a person. I have maybe met
*  five to 10 people in my life who seem like that. Well, really strong.
*  Here's something else you wrote in my quote. I internalized a lot of Ivan Ilyich, John Holt,
*  A.S. Neal, and Paulo Freire as a kid. What did you mean? You were talking, I think,
*  in the context of agency, but how did that shape you?
*  At the time, as a 12 or 13 year old, it mostly probably made me insufferable to my parents
*  because I hated school already. But that's a good thing, right?
*  It gave me a real way of expressing that and they dealt with me very patiently.
*  I think over the long term, the most important of those was... For many years, I would have said
*  Ilyich. Maybe still say Ilyich? And basically, his point is about the question... It's about
*  the question of what's the relationship between human beings and institutions and how paternalistic
*  are those institutions towards the humans? So in De-schooling Society, he really makes the point
*  that in fact, schools do not treat children as human to some extent at all. Denies them the most
*  basic kinds of agency. And just thinking about that kind of a relationship, what relationship
*  should our institutions have to individuals was very, very important to me as a teenager and then
*  sort of through my entire life. Is it why you didn't join OpenAI in 2015?
*  No. And do you regret that decision?
*  Yeah, I suppose I did consider going as they were getting started. It would have been an interesting
*  life choice. I had a lot of doubts about the wisdom of pursuing artificial general intelligence,
*  which would... I mean, not at all resolved then. They were just fears.
*  So that was part of the reason. Honestly, really the main reason at that point, though,
*  it's this point about comparative advantage. It was like, AI is happening. It's become very
*  fashionable. If you kind of wake up in the morning and it turns out that some institution is mad
*  keen to pay you to do whatever it is you're doing, you should actually think about whether or not
*  you're in the right line of business. I tend to think, unfortunately, for creative work,
*  there's an anti-correlation between how valuable what you're doing is and what you're being paid
*  often. Well, it's kind of the anti-economist point of view. It's not right, but there's a simple model
*  in which that is right. Actually, a simple, very much kind of an economist model. So I have felt
*  for more than a decade that AI was... It had become sort of around 2011, 2012, when I decided
*  to start writing my book about neural nets, it had become sort of this unstoppable force in the
*  world or very difficult to stop. It was clear it was going to attract more and more capital,
*  more and more people. And so also to some extent, I just felt like I should go and do something else
*  if that's the case. In the next 20 years, what do you think your comparative advantage will be?
*  Tell you after 20 years. But you face a year coming up now, right? Yeah, the problem is...
*  There's a step before you. The problem is, of course, it's very helpful for motivational reasons
*  to have answers to that, but your answers never turn out to what the correct answer was. Probably
*  my ability to write. And your Twitter biography says, and I quote, searching for the numinous.
*  What does that mean with respect to you?
*  Yeah. Just trying to find the deepest possible experiences in the world,
*  in people and things and ideas and places. And final question, what do you think it is
*  that you will learn about next? You love to ask this question. I've heard you ask it before.
*  I will learn much more deeply about religion than I have in the past.
*  And that involves travel, going to church, reading books, talking to people, all of those things?
*  It involves all of those things, yeah. I'm going to see the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul in the near
*  future. That's gorgeous. I've wanted to see for almost all my adult life and I have never been.
*  Have you been to Amritsar? No.
*  That to me is the most religious feeling site I've ever visited. So I would recommend going there.
*  And it's not a hard trip in any way at all. I've never been to India.
*  You must go to Amritsar. And the old cliche, something like when it comes to religion,
*  every Indian's a millionaire. It's not really true, but I still think India is the best place
*  to go to think about religion. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. I'd
*  love to go to Jerusalem as well. I think for somewhat similar reasons, but there you think
*  about tension. Yeah. The religious aspects of tension, but you think I think more about
*  tension than about religion per se. And it's very useful for that. Michael Nielsen,
*  thank you very much. Thanks so much, Tyler.
