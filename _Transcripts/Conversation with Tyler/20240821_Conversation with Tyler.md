# Nate Silver on Risk-takers, Politicians, and Poker Players  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhs3YqQUFaA)
*  Hello everyone.
*  And welcome back to conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm in New York city chatting with the great Nate silver.
*  It is late July, 2024 and Nate has recently risen in status.
*  You might say he has a new book out, which I thought was excellent, informative,
*  fun on every page on the edge, the art of risking everything.
*  Nate, welcome.
*  Thank you, Tyler.
*  Now, if we simulated the world a thousand times, how many of those scenarios would
*  you end up more or less where you are today?
*  Of course, a question I asked Peter Thiel and other people in the book.
*  Your father was a political scientist, presumably very smart, got you
*  connected to politics.
*  Well, I mean, this is a hard, I mean, it's, I feel unfair that you're asking me
*  this question that I, this unfair question I asked other people, but no, I
*  think like, I think I would wind up somewhere in this vicinity, like 20% of
*  the time, or maybe less than that.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, because the fact that you had this big breakthrough or I did
*  in the kind of 2008 election, which really was, did involve like a lot
*  of happenstance in certain ways.
*  I had been like an online poker player.
*  Um, and basically the U S government shut down online poker.
*  I mean, technically they shut down payment processing for online poker.
*  Um, but that got me very interested in the 2006 midterms because I wanted the
*  people who had passed that law to lose their seats in Congress.
*  Um, meanwhile, I lost my source of livelihood.
*  I couldn't play poker and press buttons for, for 24 hours, or not 24 hours
*  for 40 hours a week, right?
*  Um, so founded five 38, um, just kind of on a lark and that kind of changed everything.
*  So yeah, there's a lot of circumstance and luck, and there are probably, you
*  know, many ways that life could have unfolded in a way where I was unhappy at
*  some consulting job or something tragic happened or, or whatever else.
*  But poker players, they're ornery, they're individualistic.
*  I don't always want to hire them and you're one of them.
*  So isn't it, if not inevitable, likely you would have ended up
*  with some kind of independent.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's the thing is like, cause now, cause now I'm doing like three or
*  four different things, right?
*  Which in some ways makes it feel like, I mean, I sometimes feel like I'm living
*  out multiple versions of the simulation anyway, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I'm diversified in different ways.
*  Um, yeah.
*  And there might be worlds where I had won like a big poker tournament early
*  on or something like that, but like, yeah, I'm someone who's.
*  I get pretty unhappy when I'm bored.
*  Um, and I also can focus and work pretty hard.
*  So I think I would have, you know, wound up in interesting places a lot.
*  Um, but I feel very blessed and lucky to have wound up in
*  this particular place, I think.
*  What do you maximize?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, in the short run, some combination of like, um, uh, like, look this year,
*  it's kind of easier to answer that because you can have like a shorter or
*  more medium term, right?
*  Everything's thrown at you.
*  You've got to get through the day simply.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, I'm, I'm 46.
*  So there's some extent to which I feel like this year's important as far as
*  like, um, earning a fair amount of, of income, I think, because it is very
*  cyclical with election cycles and other things like that, um, of kind of having
*  good options for the second half of my life, basically, um, you know, I found a
*  lot of energy recently this year.
*  Um, I think I probably worked fewer hours than I once did, but probably
*  worked much more efficiently, have a little bit more balance.
*  Um, but yeah, it's kind of like, I am trying to like, get as much productive
*  work done as I can, um, over the next, you know, four or five months until,
*  until the election happens.
*  Um, I'm trying to build the newsletter, silver bulletin in the longterm.
*  Um, but, but, you know, I've matured a little bit.
*  I mean, I do, I, you know, I tend not to work most evenings.
*  For example, I take my share of, we were talking about travel before, right?
*  Um, I do my share of travel.
*  I have poker tournaments, which are, are fun and kind of stressful, but also
*  like a lot of hard work and kind of are an escape in different ways.
*  Um, so yeah, like I want to, I want to get to a point where for the rest of my life,
*  I can do intellectually challenging and stimulating work, I think, um, and
*  experience different things.
*  And, but this year there's like a little bit of hustle, I think, required to
*  help kind of ensure that in the longterm.
*  There's a Steve Levitt paper you cite in your book that indicates people make
*  better decisions when they flip a coin to avoid status quo bias.
*  A, do you believe that paper and B looking forward, will you be flipping any coins?
*  No, I literally will like flip coins for, um, for like, do we want to
*  go get Italian food or sushi?
*  Bigger decision.
*  Even just where should I go on my next vacation?
*  You could randomize that.
*  Do you do it?
*  That like a vacation location might be up to the max of what I would
*  randomize, I think, right.
*  But not something really important.
*  I tend to be pretty analytical about like really important, like career
*  and life choice decisions, I think.
*  Right.
*  So you don't think you have that much status quo bias?
*  I'm sure I do, but like, look, I mean, I've done a lot of different things
*  and I bounced around quite a bit and I'm kind of inherently, inherently restless.
*  I mean, one thing I think is like, you know, some of the common personality
*  flaws that flaws is a jaded loaded word, right?
*  Um, some of the common personality traits that a lot of people have, I think
*  maybe poker players overindex a little bit toward, toward the other way.
*  You know, poker players are, are pretty good at going with the flow when you're
*  playing a poker tournament, everything is contingent, right?
*  Cause the tournament could last five more days or five more minutes.
*  And so you're like, yeah, I'll go to dinner with you conditional on being
*  knocked out of the tournament and not entering this other tournament and X and
*  Y and Z.
*  And so you're kind of, you're very used to, um, to dealing with different stressors
*  and contingencies and things like that.
*  And I think that's, I think that's somewhat unusual.
*  So if you're very restless, does that seem to you like a bias in your decisions?
*  You want to counteract with nudges or something you should double down on?
*  I would say you should double down on it.
*  I think closer, closer to double down.
*  Double down.
*  Yeah.
*  So what's your main bias when you make decisions?
*  Um, I think I'm probably more emotional than people might think on, on the surface.
*  I would think you're pretty emotional.
*  Yeah, that can come out like on Twitter and things like that a little bit.
*  Um, I mean, I'm trying to think, um, you know, look, people who are very
*  competitive and I, and I put myself in that category, right?
*  I think can sometimes be like a little bit irrational about like continuing
*  to fight even if they've, even if they've already won in some ways, I think
*  that can be a bias potentially in, in certain ways.
*  Who was the first human to think probabilistically with a
*  reasonable degree of consistency?
*  I mean, or have we seen one yet?
*  No, look, I think people are actually more intuitive probabilistic reasoners
*  than, than maybe the kind of conventional wisdom holds, right?
*  I mean, if you're thinking about like some hunter gatherer, right?
*  They're reading like context clues about where there might be like the
*  particular wild beast they want to kill and want to avoid being killed by.
*  Um, you know, gambling goes back very early in many cultures.
*  It's apparently not quite universal, but probably very common in most.
*  But that's a sign they don't think probabilistically because most
*  gambling is negative sum, right?
*  At best zero sum.
*  So we should see very little of it.
*  I mean, it's originally divine from, um, from kind of divination literally, right?
*  And then kind of becomes gamified and kind of commodified.
*  Um, you know, the notion of like, um, uh, but it has plays almost like a
*  spiritual role, I think in ancient, I don't know this anthropology super well.
*  I would read a couple of books on it, but like it almost is like a spiritual
*  divination role, right?
*  The notion of like, um, gambling halls or casinos, I think kind of dates back to,
*  you know, maybe 16th or 17th century Europe, roughly like that's, that's
*  potentially newer, um, but the notion of like tempting one's fate, I think, um,
*  which is still a romantic notion.
*  I think some gamblers have, right?
*  Like Irving Goffman, who I cite in the book is like, um, this is someone who
*  has like on we or whatever, maybe I'm using that term wrong, but like they're,
*  they need to prove, um, that they're capable of taking a chance.
*  It can be a little bit gendered.
*  I think he thinks of it more as like, uh, uh, you know, post world war II
*  American male who feels like he has fewer chances to like demonstrate his bravery.
*  And that's, that's always been kind of one conception of, of gambling
*  is a simulation of, of actual risk.
*  Why shouldn't people gamble only in the positive?
*  Some games.
*  So take the U S stock market.
*  That certainly seems to be one of them and manufacture all the suspense you
*  want, learn about the companies, the CEO, get your thrill that way and don't do
*  any other gambling.
*  Why isn't that just better for everyone?
*  Yeah, look, I'm not necessarily a fan of like gambling for gambling sake, right?
*  You know, I don't, you know, twice a year I'll be some in casinos
*  and in Las Vegas a lot, right?
*  Twice a year I'll have like a friend who's like, let's just go play
*  black Jack for an hour and have a couple of like free drinks and things like that.
*  Right.
*  But like, I, I, I like to make bets where I think at least in principle, I have an
*  edge or at least can fool myself into thinking I have an edge sometimes with
*  the sports stuff.
*  It's like, you probably know deep down and you're kind of roughly breakeven
*  or something like that.
*  You're doing some smart things, like looking at five different sites and
*  finding the line that's best, which wipes out some, but not all the house edge.
*  But no, I, I, you know, I'm not a huge fan of like, of like slot machines.
*  Certainly I think are kind of very gnarly and addictive in various ways.
*  They limit your sports betting, don't they?
*  Yeah, I've been limited by, by six or seven of like the nine New York retail
*  sites.
*  And what's the potential edge they think you might have.
*  It's just that if they think, if you have the pattern of some, so if you're
*  betting $2,000 on like the wizard's hornets game, the moment the line comes
*  out on draft Kings, right, you're clearly not a recreational better.
*  So just the hallmarks of trying to be a winning player, meaning betting lines
*  early, cause the line's early and you don't have price discovery yet, right?
*  The early lines are often very beatable.
*  I'm betting on obscure stuff like, you know, will this player get X number
*  of rebounds or things like that?
*  Um, but like it's, you know, if you have a knack for, if draft Kings has a line
*  at minus three and a half and it's minus four elsewhere, then then it can be called
*  steam chasing where you bet, um, before a line moves in other places.
*  If you have injury information, I mean, it's like, it's a very weird game.
*  And I think people, I think one thing people, I hope people are more aware of
*  is that they are a lot of the sites and some are, some are better than others,
*  right?
*  But they, they really don't want winning players and their advertising is
*  actually has changed.
*  It used to be, they would say for like daily fantasy sports, which was the
*  predecessor, Hey, you're a smart guy.
*  I mean, it was the ads are very cynical, right?
*  You're a smart guy in a cubicle.
*  Why don't you go, uh, do all your spreadsheet stuff and actually draft
*  this team and make a lot of money.
*  And like literally you'll be sleeping with supermodels and in two months, you
*  win the million dollar prize from draft Kings.
*  And now they don't even try to advertise it as a skill game anymore, which in
*  some ways, which in some ways is a mistake because the appeal to like the
*  male ego is like a huge, is a huge way to get new customers for sports betting
*  and things like that.
*  Um, every, every sports fan thinks he knows has some proprietary edge or
*  knowledge or, or, or insight.
*  Um, so, but no, they, they, they really don't want, I mean, I think, you know,
*  I guess like plus EV sports betters are like not a big lobbying group
*  and not a big cause exactly.
*  Um, but you know, I think there should be regulations on like, uh, how much
*  can you kind of price discriminate between your customers, right?
*  Cause literally they'll take like a million dollar bet from somebody and
*  like, wouldn't take even a $50 bet from me on the same game and things like that.
*  Um, which also creates problems because, you know, money has a way to flow,
*  uh, you know, if, if Tyler, if you are able to bet a million dollars, right.
*  And I'm able to bet $50 and I'm a winning better than there's certain ways in
*  which information will probably flow from, from me to you in an inefficient
*  way, but eventually, um, but, but no, the industry is, is, is very cynical in
*  some ways and, and, you know, the kind of old school Vegas idea of we're going
*  to post our line and everybody gets a crack, right.
*  Um, you can bet X amount at a time when you make a bet, then we may change the
*  line and you can bet again like that attitude has been lost to kind of more
*  of this European UK style where you're doing lots and lots of customer
*  segmentation and, and trying to maximize your, um, the amount of money you make
*  from whales, which are, which are bad degenerate gamblers and, and not take
*  much action at all from, from sharps.
*  Of course you lose like the price discovery element of that.
*  It's a pretty interesting industry economically.
*  So like what happens is there are a few sharp sites that will say, Hey, we will
*  take 5,000 bucks from anybody and that helps us have better pricing and discover
*  better lines, right?
*  Because by the time you get to, um, you know, kick off or tip off of a game, then
*  you're taking $50,000 bets or more.
*  So, so to have someone who's willing to give someone a small plus CV bet.
*  For a smaller amount, because then you'll get your retail customers later on.
*  That was like the old, the old model.
*  Shouldn't they just stop the betting on say how many rebounds a player pulls
*  down because it encourages corruption.
*  It's not actually a suspenseful act, whether it's seven or eight rebounds.
*  Whereas who wins the super bowl presumably is a suspenseful,
*  meaningful act for many people.
*  That's right.
*  No, it's, it's, um, or, you know, if you have like a Jalen Brunson, I'm a
*  Knicks fan, right, or someone who's like a major star, then it might make sense.
*  But, but no, uh, these books have way too wide a menu of events and the, and the
*  sharper books don't, the sharper books will kind of pull a line down if, if, um,
*  if Steph Curry is questionable for the game, right?
*  You can get a gigantic edge.
*  If you have any inside information about like, whether he's going to play or not.
*  So they will just like not take that bet or they won't do the more esoteric
*  player prop stuff or things like the NFL draft, which is very, if you, you know,
*  if you are an NFL reporter for ESPN, then you could probably absolutely crush
*  NFL draft bets.
*  You might get fired if someone finds out, but like, but so, um, but the retail
*  books are like, yeah, we can put bets up that a knowledgeable person could make
*  money on, um, because we won't let the knowledgeable people bet in the first
*  place and that's, that's the kind of, I think, relatively, you know, I guess
*  it's a sustainable equilibrium in the long run.
*  I'm not quite so sure.
*  One thing that sites like draft Kings are relying upon is they are basically
*  piggybacking off, off the sharp sites.
*  Um, because you can kind of just set your line based on, on like Pinnacle,
*  for example, or Circa, these are books that are, are sharp and they actually
*  do take bets from winning customers.
*  So drafting is kind of piggybacks off them.
*  If we could enforce a outright ban, what's the cost benefit analysis
*  on banning all sports gambling?
*  I mean, I'm more of a libertarian than a strict utilitarian, I think.
*  Um, what's the utilitarian price of being a libertarian?
*  Look, I think most of the studies on gambling says that it's kind of a, a
*  good transaction in terms of like, you know, people get some degree of
*  enjoyment and excitement out of it, but maybe you have like, you know,
*  5% of the population that becomes very addicted, um, and that 5% of the
*  population that becomes very addicted and that 5% can account for a large
*  share of volume, right?
*  Like, look, if it were me, if I were kind of the gambling czar, um, I
*  would probably ban slot machines and, and let everything else go more or less.
*  I think, um, I think from like, if, you know, the utilitarian part of me for
*  slot machines, um, is maybe enough to outweigh the libertarian part.
*  Um, I think it's not really designed to, to be addictive.
*  Um, it's not very transparent, um, kind of what the odds actually are.
*  You can't actually go and, and it doesn't say you have a nine, negative
*  9% ROI at this particular slot machine.
*  Um, if you look at the demographics of slot machines, it's much lower income.
*  I mean, you know, sports betting and poker, which are the two kinds of
*  forms I participate in myself are like, are mostly done by fairly high income
*  to lose, but, but yeah, slot machines are nasty things.
*  Speaking of scale, if we put you in a time machine, send you back to 1970
*  and you're playing poker, why exactly is it that you would win so much?
*  Um, so one way to put it is that, so poker actually has been solved more or
*  less with game theory, um, with a big complicated programs called solvers
*  that calculate the Nash equilibrium for, for any situation given certain inputs.
*  But when you're at the table, that's of limited use to you, right?
*  No, I mean, because like, uh, yeah, I mean, the strategy.
*  So if you think about like the history of like Texas Hold'em or poker, like
*  probably 99% of poker that's ever been played, every hand that's been played
*  counting online and things like that has been played in like the last 10 years.
*  Right.
*  Poker is not that old the game.
*  It kind of goes back to the kind of Mississippi riverboats for many years.
*  People weren't really trying to use computers or anything to solve it.
*  When Doyle Brunson played, right.
*  Just like actually he would literally by hand simulate hands by like dealing out
*  a deck hundreds of times to see does a pair of dues, twos, dues, this pair of
*  twos beat ace king offsuit more often than not, right.
*  Um,
*  why isn't there evolution across temperament?
*  So say people back then, they don't know to be aggressive enough because they
*  didn't study game theory, but the ones who are aggressive enough naturally,
*  they're just going to win more money.
*  It will become somewhat obvious over time.
*  That's the way to play.
*  And you might be slightly better than the others in 1970, but not have a
*  huge advantage, like is the abstract knowledge that powerful compared to
*  market evolution?
*  Well, so what are we, are we seeing if I went back today,
*  everything, you know, time machine, you sit down, you're going to do really well.
*  Right.
*  I would, I would, I think dominate the games.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And it's because you know, game theory and they don't like Thomas Schelling was
*  what 1960 from Norman Morgenstern, you know, just after world war two,
*  like game theory is not that new.
*  What exactly is it, you know, to be like a tight, aggressive player with your
*  strategy, tight aggressive, tight aggressive.
*  I saw that in a lot of old movies, tight aggressive is part of it.
*  Right.
*  But like, it's very hard to maybe intuitively know, um, what the right
*  bluffing frequency is and in a certain spot, right.
*  Um, you know, for many years, people would also give away lots and lots and
*  lots of tells, um, if you go back and like, watch like footage of like the 1987
*  world series of poker, there are incredibly obvious tells.
*  And I think it just kind of, it's kind of just like, there's pressure on the
*  market to like compress it into a diamond or what am I even talking about?
*  But, but like, I think we were just kind of very early in the lifecycle of the
*  competitive pressures on the game and in poker, um, and in some ways it's like
*  kind of a metaphor for like other kinds of capitalistic ventures.
*  But I think, I think, I think you, while people may be under underestimating
*  the efficiency gains that are to be had when there are kind of proper incentives
*  and proper technology, basically the kind of combination and just like the sheer
*  volume of the number of kind of nodes on the game tree that have been explored.
*  So let's say you're a poker champion.
*  You want to quit.
*  You can prove you are a champion.
*  You're still young.
*  Who is it who wants to hire you in the actual world?
*  Oh, for sure.
*  I mean, you know, where would you go?
*  Like a trading firm or.
*  Oh, I mean, hedge funds.
*  I mean, you know, some of them like Susquehanna or Jane street in
*  particular are known for, um, for hiring X poker players.
*  Uh, and what's the main flaw those individuals have as traders,
*  whatever their virtues may be.
*  I mean, I feel like chess players have flaws as traders, math Olympiad
*  types have flaws as traders.
*  What's the flaws of the poker players?
*  I mean, I've only been on the poker.
*  I have done a little bit of consulting for financial firms.
*  Um, you know, my experience doing that is, is that it's
*  actually very similar, right?
*  Um, because if you're like.
*  Working for a trading desk, um, and you're being asked, what's your
*  opinion of how event X will affect opportunity wide trade in the market?
*  Um, it's very much a game of estimation and it's very much a game of incomplete
*  information and it's making decisions quickly, which is, which is very, I think.
*  Poker like, um, and there can be value in like kind of running a formal model and
*  being more, more complete about something.
*  That's kind of what I do for like the election modeling type stuff, but like,
*  but the trading opportunities pass, pass very quickly and the premium on, on
*  speed relative to, you know, I mean, journalism actually, there's a little
*  bit of premium on speed too, right?
*  But you know, to negatively stereotype.
*  Academia would be the contrast to that, right?
*  Where there it's like, you can have the perfect answer, but like it takes you a
*  year to publish a paper, whereas, whereas can you have a good answer in.
*  In five minutes, right?
*  If you're, if you're trading some commodity and, and, and Joe Biden has kind
*  of a face plant at this debate, um, you know, you have to make a decision within
*  a couple of minutes about that.
*  Um, likewise in sports betting, you see some line that clearly doesn't make sense.
*  And you have to infer, is this like a golden opportunity or did like Patrick
*  Mahomes just get injured or something like that, right?
*  And you have to make inferences very, very quickly.
*  And so I think, I think, I think the poker players probably do pretty,
*  pretty well in that environment.
*  Now you've run five 38.
*  Now your newsletter has evolved into being like a true business.
*  Do you seek to hire top poker players or you avoid them like the plague?
*  Like one is enough.
*  I'm enough.
*  You know, we don't need any more of that scale.
*  Get lost fellow.
*  I would for sure.
*  I mean, so poker players are sometimes a little bit lacking in organization and
*  probably I'm a little bit lacking in an organization, right?
*  And poker players are people who are kind of, um, sometimes they're a little
*  bit irreverent, which is a quality I like, but like, but you know, I think I
*  knew people who were like, you know, the, um, the elections analysts to hire now.
*  I mean, he is somebody who, um, you know, he's never failed to like, he's great.
*  Eli never failed to like return like a text message.
*  Within like 15 minutes or something like that, right?
*  I don't know when he sleeps and I need somebody like that.
*  Cause I'm running all over the place and, and I can be like a little run hot
*  and cold and be like a little bit moody.
*  So I think you want someone who's a little bit more, more steady, um, for the
*  newsletter, I think also, you know, the writing skills are very important.
*  I mean, I don't know if it's becoming more important or less important in the
*  kind of world of chat GPT and so forth, but like, um, just the ability to like,
*  I mean, working on the book and then the newsletter, just to, you know, to
*  write every day, I mean, I feel like you can get like two X or three X, like
*  faster at writing, like literally, if you just kind of get a lot of reps in and
*  things like that, um, but, but for sure there are like, you know, I was very
*  blessed by, it was the first time I've ever kind of hired someone for this job
*  as opposed to like at five 38, um, and I was very excited by kind of how many
*  smart, mostly young people there, there were out there.
*  And so hopefully I'll find other ways to hire, to hire more of them in the
*  future, but like, but yeah, um, but people who are a little bit more directed,
*  I think, and, and, and organized
*  and running five 38 and now your current ventures.
*  What have you learned about social science, economics, game theory that
*  you didn't know to begin with?
*  I mean, I think I've, I feel like I've learned more in the past three years.
*  I mean, formerly I've been away from five 38 for like a year and change now, right?
*  Informally, there was kind of a lame duck period where I was, you know, I was
*  allowed under my contract with Disney to write a book.
*  Um, so it's kind of probably focused on the edge.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it took three years and just like, if you take three years and just like
*  talk to like 200 really smart people, that's, that's, that's an amazing thing
*  to do.
*  I mean, it's kind of what you do, but like, but like, I wish I kind of
*  spent more of that time in my whole life, but, um, but no, look, I mean,
*  uh, at five 38, I mean, the constant frustration was that we were kind of
*  brought in during a period of, during a peacetime period for, for ESPN before
*  we went to ABC news, where they felt like they had the world's best business
*  and could just kind of print money and we could be like a, a loss leader for them.
*  Um, and so you never actually had any incentives in place to, to run an actual
*  business.
*  It was no, no one was going to lose their job because five 38 lost X amount of
*  money every year when you have a company that's making hundreds of millions of
*  dollars a year until you face, you know, headwinds and like cable TV and theme
*  parks and all these things all of a sudden are like become very challenging
*  businesses in, in a lot of ways, the movie industry during COVID and things
*  like that.
*  Um, so yeah, I mean, it's a shame because, um, based on the early growth of the
*  newsletter, I mean, I think, I think five 38 could have been a very, very good
*  subscriber business.
*  And we kind of tried to push that internally, but like in a big company,
*  the logic doesn't make sense.
*  You're like, well, we have, um, Hulu plus launching and therefore we can't have
*  another subscriber business that would distract from Hulu plus, right?
*  It just, it's just very strange.
*  I'm not sure how much of that is a result of being at Disney in particular,
*  because they're all about gigantic scale, right?
*  It is theme parks.
*  It is NBA and NFL contracts for hundreds of millions of dollars over a period of
*  time.
*  It's being in every kind of household in America, every movie theater.
*  Um, so I don't think they saw the value of like, uh, a small to medium size
*  business that could still be a good business and a prestigious business
*  and profitable on its own merits.
*  Um, and that was frustrating.
*  Just to go for like, you know, given that I am tend to be pretty incentive driven,
*  like to have spent like 10 years at a company where you basically had like no
*  incentive to work hard and sometimes some probably for the first eight years of
*  that, I worked my ass off anyway, but it just, it just so nice to like actually
*  kind of own your own, own your own work product.
*  And like, you know, with subscriber newsletters in particular, the incentives
*  are pretty, are pretty linear, right?
*  If you post more, you tend to get more, more signups and a long run, make more
*  revenue.
*  And so, and so that's, that's a very nice change of pace and very motivating.
*  I think.
*  Do you think that sports analytics has made sports too homogenized and more
*  boring?
*  So right now, for instance, the New York Knicks, they're in a way trying to copy
*  the Celtics.
*  Well, everyone should be a good shooter and everyone should be a good defender.
*  In the 1980s or nineties teams were more different.
*  Should I be happy about this?
*  I think it's a, I think it's the better version of the critique, right?
*  Because some sports, like, I think the average NBA style is fairly attractive
*  now, right?
*  Like I want 23 point shots, I would say maybe a little bit, but like, I mean, if
*  you go watch, like, if you go watch footage of like a game from like the
*  nineties or something, right?
*  I mean, this is, this is more aesthetically appealing.
*  It shows off some of the athleticism, I think, but no, the fact that you have
*  less variety, this is true in poker too, by the way, right?
*  There are fewer different varieties of like loose aggressive versus tight
*  aggressive poker players.
*  You can't get away as much with having like a, a flawed eccentric strategy and
*  then making up for it in, in other ways, which is kind of a, kind of a shame.
*  Maybe in the long run, it means we're not exploring different branches of the tree
*  as well.
*  And that can be problematic.
*  But yeah, I mean, it's, it's, you know, it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a
*  it's a bad time when things get hyper efficient, then then maybe the quirky
*  players, I mean, even I saw a video yesterday about like major league
*  baseball batting stances.
*  And I used to be guys that had like very, very funky batting stances and things
*  like that, right.
*  And those have, those have largely disappeared, right?
*  If it kind of costs you two hundreds of a point of batting average, you hit
*  two 89 instead of two 91, then like there's enough money on the line and
*  enough kind of resources and training and enough kind of sports science where
*  we're probably get beat out of you potentially.
*  Well, Joel Embiid ever win a title.
*  I know Darrell Morey pretty well.
*  And he, I think I'm probably a fan of yours.
*  And so, uh, I'd say yes, I think.
*  I mean, and you think Paul George was a good idea.
*  I think it was a bad idea.
*  He's 34.
*  He's had a history of being flaky.
*  He's a very talented player, but he doesn't seem like the kind of guy to put you over
*  the edge and they need more of a glue guy.
*  I mean, so, so Darrell Morey is very good at finding like the league average players
*  that can like, that can provide the glue guy.
*  No, I think, I think it's a good move.
*  I mean, I think like, um, you know, look, Darrell understands the importance of,
*  of swinging for the fences if healthy.
*  That's a very big, big three.
*  And then he'll find ways to, you know, acquire the minimum salary guys or
*  whatever loopholes there are in the salary cap to get the $10 million a year guys.
*  Um, and, and, you know, if healthy, that's a team that can
*  challenge the Celtics.
*  I think, I mean, if healthy, I mean, what's the conditional probability in all three of
*  their big three being healthy, probably below 50% frankly.
*  Um, but, you know, but you don't want like the average outcome and also the incentives
*  in the NBA.
*  And if you, if you try to like model out what the true discount rate is for sports
*  general managers, um, I mean, they have some absurdly high discount rate, like 30% or
*  something like that or 50% because they, their jobs last for like five years on average.
*  Right.
*  Um, and so, and so, you know, I think it's a, I think it's a, a fairly smart play to
*  swing for swing for the fences.
*  Luca overrated or underrated.
*  Well, I lost a fair bit of money trying to bet against the Mavericks in the
*  playoffs, so I can't call them underrated.
*  Um, or can't call them overrated, I guess.
*  Um, I think Luca is properly rated.
*  Properly rated.
*  And who's the most underrated player in the NBA?
*  I use 2024 for our listeners.
*  I mean, I think Jaylen Brunson in some ways, and now that's the next fan coming out,
*  although he was, I think fifth or sixth in the MVP voting potentially this year.
*  Yeah.
*  He was pretty high.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, as a Knicks fan, that's kind of one that comes to mind a little bit.
*  I mean, I think some of the Celtics, like, you know, Derek White, I think is a very
*  underrated player.
*  Um, you know, because I'm not, I mean, I like Jason Tatum and Jaylen Brown, right?
*  But I think, I think, you know, they are maybe respected to like the seventh or
*  eighth and like the 23rd best player in the league, and they were like a great
*  historic team.
*  And I think that, you know, the holidays and the, and the, and the Derek Whites
*  and players like that are, are, are, you know, maybe like top 30 NBA players,
*  like really, really good.
*  I think I'd say Jokic, who to me is the greatest offensive player ever.
*  Not necessarily recognized as such certainly has a very high reputation,
*  but maybe not as high as it should be.
*  No, people are, I mean, even this year, right?
*  You saw people were willing to kind of turn on him a little bit.
*  I don't think people, I mean, I think, you know, I think the consensus now of
*  smart NBA nerds that he's the best player in the league.
*  I think people might not realize that this is one of the highest peaks of any
*  player in NBA history.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think that's widely recognized.
*  How will AI improve sports analytics?
*  I mean, I think it will improve things in areas like computer vision things and
*  classifying plays and things like that.
*  I think we'll help a fair bit.
*  Um, I mean, sports is weird because it's kind of in this medium data environment,
*  um, where it's not quite a big data problem.
*  Although you could have more data if you put money into it, right?
*  Yeah.
*  No, I think it'll help more in the sports where they're kind of like less linear.
*  I think things like, you know, classifying strategies and like soccer and football,
*  where you have like a lot of things happening at once and you can't kind of
*  have your nice little regression model.
*  I think, I think, you know, as compared to say baseball where baseball is kind of
*  very easy to represent with kind of classical statistics.
*  Um, so, you know, I mean, I think it'll probably, there'll also be ways where it
*  enhances like the sports viewing experience in different ways.
*  I think it'll help like sports video games a lot.
*  Um, yeah.
*  So our hockey and combat sports going to use more analytics in the future.
*  I mean, one of my friends, uh, named Sonny Metta, um, is an analyst for the
*  Florida Panthers and assistant GM.
*  And, and he's an analytics guy, former poker player, former jazz musician, and
*  just won the Stanley cup in Florida.
*  So, um, so it's transitioning in, in all the sports, I think, I mean, hockey,
*  probably of the big four in the U S, um, is considered the most old school.
*  Um, but yeah, look, I mean, the market's fairly, fairly efficient.
*  And I think people have, you know, we're kind of long past the old boys network
*  in most of the sports, probably in hockey.
*  If you talk to Sonny, he'd say maybe, maybe two thirds of teams are fairly
*  smart and one third of them are still kind of, are still kind of dumb.
*  Um, you know, I think, but I think, I think we've, I think we've probably
*  passed the low hanging fruit from money ball gains stage, right?
*  Um, question I was asked during a Jane street talk once, what is the most
*  underrated basketball statistic for judging a player?
*  Um, well, it's contextual because they, you know, I think like we've gotten
*  to the point now where like offensive rebounding has gotten underrated actually.
*  Um, if you try to tease out the effect of rebounding and statistical models, then
*  there are various kinds of things where different variables are correlated where
*  basically, I think if you look carefully, then offensive rebounding is
*  actually quite, quite valuable.
*  I mean, you regain a whole possession that's worth, like that's worth a lot.
*  Um, whereas defensive rebounding is kind of, um, you know, rarely is an individual
*  player doing something right to get a defensive rebound, whereas an offensive
*  rebound requires like a lot more skill and provides a lot more value because
*  the expectation is 75% chance that like you lose the ball.
*  So, um, so if you get an offensive rebound, that's like adding like,
*  you know, seven tenths or eight tenths of a point, basically, you
*  get a whole possession back.
*  My answer was team wins.
*  At least if you've been on more than one team, like does a good team want you
*  that's picking up your intangibles.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, I think uniquely in basketball because it's five players, um, in a
*  lineup at any given time, um, and a good player can control, you know, half the
*  offense or, or more literally Luca type player or Steph Curry type player.
*  Um, yeah, I think that's a, that's a more adequate test in, in basketball than
*  other sports, um, or maybe for an NFL quarterback, right?
*  Um, I grew up kind of in baseball was my favorite sport for a long time and there
*  it's more individual and there I was always kind of fighting against the team
*  wins argument, like I think it's like not, um, not a major indictment of Mike
*  Trout that the angels haven't been very good, but it's not just you causing
*  possible wins even before you've played for the team, the fact that they want you
*  says something good about you.
*  So like KCP has been wanted by good teams.
*  His stats are good, but not awesome.
*  But that is a good sign about his quality.
*  I think so, although we, we start to get into circularities and people become
*  kind of aware of that kind of thing.
*  I mean, I feel like this way a little bit with like prediction markets too.
*  And I, you know, I consult now for poly markets, so I'm kind of officially a
*  champion of prediction markets.
*  Um, but kind of when people believe, oh, the traders must be doing something
*  really smart, therefore it's trustworthy.
*  It kind of can become circular logic.
*  I think sometimes where, um, where you can make yourself vulnerable to
*  thinking you have blind spots and kind of having like a bystander problem.
*  Basically.
*  Um, but, but yeah, I mean, you have to, someone actually has to have alpha
*  they're providing value add they're providing, and then other people can kind
*  of, can kind of, uh, uh, drift off that or what's draft off that I'm thinking
*  about the cycling term, um, but now and then someone thinks that everyone else
*  has vouched for somebody.
*  It's kind of like the story of Sam McMinn Fried in the book a little bit
*  that everyone assumed that because he has such prestigious, um, coattails
*  that he's hanging out with Anna Wintour and hanging out with, um, you know,
*  Bill Clinton and Tony Blair and like, uh, he has his name up on a basketball
*  arena in Miami and he's getting his praises sung by everybody and Sequoia
*  capital and things like that.
*  Um, that like, you know, at the heart of it, I mean, it was kind of a big fraud.
*  I mean, that's the term I'm choosing intentionally.
*  And what's your model of his risk taking behavior?
*  I mean, I think he, I mean, like interviews with you, I mean, I think, I
*  think he is quite insane.
*  I think as a term, I, you know, irresponsible and insane, but like, you
*  know, I think he was very literal about like, he'd literally be willing to like,
*  take the St.
*  Petersburg paradox bat where like, if you could improve his version of
*  utility by 2.00001 X, um, like he would like literally say, Hey, I'm a
*  strict utilitarian.
*  I'm willing to take that gamble.
*  I think, I think he was like, you know, in my interviews with me, he was almost
*  proud of the high risk of ruin that he was taking.
*  Um, and he would say things like, if you're not willing to like actually
*  literally ruin yourself where you're literally a laughing stock, then
*  you're doing something wrong.
*  Is asking whether he might have been a sociopath, a substitute for a
*  risk analysis of his behavior, or is it a way of getting at the proper
*  risk analysis of his behavior?
*  No, I think that, I think that term is, is properly used because he's also
*  engaged in with other people and running a giant company that people have
*  deposited millions of dollars with and invested hundreds of millions of dollars
*  in, and I think, I think, I think that's a proper frame, right?
*  I mean, the kind of combination, the book is all about people who have this.
*  I was going to say risk taking gene.
*  I realize it's like a little bit imprecise.
*  I think probably is genetic in part.
*  Um, but you know, but how does that pair with other different qualities?
*  Um, you know, the most common pairing in the book is being really risk
*  taking with really analytical, which is a very powerful, I think, pairing.
*  Um, and you use the phrase, what those people are in the river on the river.
*  What is it called?
*  I call the community, the river.
*  So it's got the river is the, the virtual community of like-minded people, but
*  that includes everything from, um, from poker to Silicon Valley, if you go kind
*  of further upstream, as I call it, even things like effective altruism and
*  rationalism, like one thing that I found in the book is I kind of had this
*  outline of like, here are all these areas that are interesting to me and kind
*  of literally start out.
*  I mean, the first act I took for the book was I flew to Florida, my first trip on
*  a plane after the pandemic, um, and went to a giant casino in Hollywood, Florida
*  and played a poker tournament and just kind of like, and branched out from there.
*  But like, but the commonality you have between how the, how all the different
*  analytical nerds think, right?
*  How the effective altruists and the hedge funders and the poker players and
*  the VCs, I mean, it's like not exactly exactly different groups though.
*  Don't some subsets of those groups get fooled to an especially high degree?
*  So, um, not the hedge fund people, right?
*  They face very strict discipline, but the effective altruists, the
*  rationalists, there's something to me a bit clueless about them.
*  Maybe systemically.
*  Yeah.
*  I think the EA and look, the book has a very long discussion of EA and, and in
*  the spirit of EA, I'm sure it'll get reviewed on these different forums.
*  And I hope that it's a fair.
*  I mostly like EA to be clear.
*  I mostly like them too.
*  There's still some epistemic defect in the people that I observe.
*  I think they're a little bit, I think they're a little bit too
*  trusting is one thing.
*  Um, you know, I think there is a lot to be said for having, um, skin the game is
*  a term that I didn't invent, but like, you know, um, you know, I think poker
*  players, one of their best qualities is they have really good BS detectors.
*  Right.
*  And they've seen like lots of smart.
*  SBF like nerds who go on a winning streak and win a couple of tournaments
*  and like, and, but are bullshitters and like, aren't all they're cracked up to
*  be, and I think, I think EA is maybe kind of lack that, that BS detecting ability.
*  Um,
*  you ever see that old YouTube video when Ollie G presents to Donald Trump,
*  pre-presidential Trump and Trump just dismisses him immediately and walks away.
*  Right.
*  So Trump has the BS detection ability.
*  And how does that fit with your model of the river people?
*  Isn't he in other ways, almost the opposite of the analytical river people?
*  So I will say if you take the EAs and put it in a separate camp, I mean, they are
*  unusual because they have this analytical skillset, um, but they are, are less
*  competitive, I think.
*  Um, but then kind of the movement gets usurped by this guy, Sam McManfrey, who's
*  extremely competitive, um, and I think run circles around them in some ways, even
*  though he's kind of lying about things in other ways.
*  Um, but yeah, look, I mean, um, maybe competitiveness is, is good.
*  And like, you know, I mean, the book is also against, um, kind of the Peter
*  Singer form of kind of selfless utilitarianism where, um, where, you know,
*  I worry that people aren't that aren't, I mean, some of this comes from like your
*  critiques, I think of, but like people that aren't like a little bit partial, then
*  I worry that everything just kind of falls apart on some level, right?
*  There's no incentive compatibility without some partiality.
*  There's no incentive compatibility and, and, and, you know, it's interesting.
*  I think Peter Singer too, talks a little bit about how like, he almost thinks
*  people that are like, um, somewhere on the spectrum are actually better moral
*  reasoners, he thinks in some ways, right?
*  There's evidence for this in some papers.
*  In fact, yeah.
*  Um, they have less status quo bias.
*  They're more impartial in some ways.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there might be something to that, but like, but like, and there are lots of
*  people in the book that probably would be classified as being on the spectrum
*  where we classify themselves that way.
*  Um, but, but, you know, I, you know, poker uniquely, I think.
*  Involves some combination of analytical skills and, and street smarts.
*  If you totally lack the street smarts, then I think it's still pretty hard to
*  get ahead in a kind of competitive world.
*  You're too likely to be taken advantage of.
*  Now your father was an academic.
*  Did you get your street smarts from him or from somewhere else?
*  Um, probably not.
*  I mean, my dad's, you know, a sharp guy and he would do things that were difficult
*  problems, like he tried to basically, he was a Sovietologist back in the day.
*  Um, and we'd try to interpret from.
*  Rigged Soviet data, like what the real vital statistics were, right?
*  How many bursts deaths?
*  So he's like, yeah.
*  So it's, yeah.
*  Things have become more like criminology all the time in US politics.
*  Yeah.
*  So that involves like making differences from, from incomplete data, right?
*  At one point he was, um, you know, offered me part of a team to kind of figure out
*  how many deaths there had actually been in the Holocaust.
*  I think thankfully turn that down because that would be a thankless task for sure.
*  Um, but yeah, but, but he was starting out by working with data that was
*  imperfect, inadequate, sometimes fabricated and trying to find the
*  real inferences from there.
*  Um, but no, look, a lot of it comes from, from, from being very competitive, right?
*  Um, being on debate team and things like that in high school, um, you know, playing
*  poker for, for many years now, um, you know, having a fair amount of.
*  Of life experience.
*  I mean, we kind of kind of talked before about how, like, I'm a little bit
*  rambunctious and easily dissatisfied.
*  And I've, you know, I, at this point, I think I've traveled, not like you, but
*  been to a lot of different places and things like that and talked to a lot of people.
*  What's the stupidest risk you're willing to take?
*  Though it could be, oh, I'd go in a submersible with a billionaire or, you
*  know, I take a helicopter ride every week or what's your stupidest risk?
*  Maybe not thinking enough about, I've tried to become more healthy over time.
*  It's a boring answer, right?
*  But like, you know, I think I still probably have like too much of a short
*  term bias in terms of like, kind of, you know, not doing enough things to, um,
*  help extend my lifespan and things like that.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I mean, I've, I've, you know, one time when I was like, uh, like 10 or 11 years
*  old, the one at sleep away camp, right.
*  Uh, one of the instructors like dared me to like, go walk around this pond with
*  only a flashlight at midnight or something like that, right.
*  And for some reason I did it.
*  I don't know why.
*  I think they got fired.
*  It was like a big scandal or something.
*  Um, but that doesn't sound risky.
*  If you're walking around the pond, you're not walking on the winter ice, right?
*  No, to be fair, right.
*  But like you're 11 years old and you're by yourself and you have only a flashlight.
*  It's probably not the smartest thing in the world.
*  Um, but yeah, I think my stupidest risks might just be road trips in places
*  where the drivers are bad.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, I should do less of that.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you go to, um, I went to Costa Rica a couple of years ago, right.
*  And you're like, it's very rainy there.
*  Obviously at least the part of Costa Rica that I was in.
*  Um, yeah.
*  And you're probably doing things like, um, you know, going swimming on these, I mean,
*  the waves in Costa Rica are really something, right.
*  But it's probably, probably like objectively pretty dangerous to be, you
*  know, in the Pacific ocean without a lifeguard nearby.
*  It's probably fairly dangerous, right.
*  Yeah.
*  Or, um, or going up some gravel road in the middle of a rainstorm.
*  Um, but I think people need some, you wouldn't want to take that risk constantly.
*  Right.
*  But you have to, I think you have to like live a little bit, you know,
*  but what's the way you would describe or think about what it adds to your life?
*  Because I do know people who don't do any of that.
*  Maybe they're missing something, but what is it?
*  What is it exactly?
*  I mean, I think there is, I mean, I think probably it is genetic in part.
*  There is some like quote unquote thrill seeking gene.
*  You know, I like, I like spicy food, for example, right.
*  Um, you know, I like travel.
*  I like experiences that are more visceral.
*  I mean, I think they're, I think there has to be some innate component and people
*  I've talked to that, like I've talked to in the book, it's like mostly quants
*  and things like that.
*  It's like, you know, hedge fund people and poker players.
*  There is one section of people who are physical risk takers, people who are
*  like literally like explorers.
*  I talked to an astronaut for example.
*  Um, and they'll say, yeah, if you talk to the people who were, who were mountain
*  climbing, right.
*  Scaling the seven summits where you're up 28,000 feet and you actually have some
*  risk of dying, like they, their community thinks there's something, something
*  genetic about it.
*  Um, they think it's like related to a certain type of stoicism almost.
*  But what's the richness they get added to their lives that maybe I would not.
*  Cause I'm somewhat risky with travel, but I'm not at all risky with physical
*  activities.
*  I think the notion of, of cheating death has to be kind of, has to be kind of
*  thrilling, right.
*  Um, I mean, you know, I think some of them are maybe a little bit depressed in
*  some ways and it's kind of like a, not quite self-destructive or suicidal, but
*  adjacent to that, right?
*  Like maybe you figure, well, you know, I'm a little depressed and so I can kind
*  of like, um, I can have a lot of fun and cheat death or if I die, then maybe it's
*  not that bad.
*  I mean, I know it's kind of going to a dark place, right.
*  But like some of like, some of Sam McMinn Fried's confidants who are I think in
*  a very different category than like these mountain climbers or things like that.
*  Right.
*  Um, they would say things like, well, he was kind of miserable anyway, right.
*  So he wouldn't necessarily mind going to jail because his day-to-day life, he
*  just, he was depressed and kind of unhappy.
*  And so therefore, you know, that's probably a pretty bad reason to be
*  massively risk-taking.
*  Um, but I think there might be some, some element of that.
*  I mean, maybe if you think of like a, it's going to a slightly dark place, but like
*  an Anthony Bourdain type, right.
*  As someone who you would think of as being very risk-taking and like, you know,
*  like probably traveling to places where it's objectively pretty dangerous.
*  I'm sure he'd like a very adequate crew with him and things like that.
*  Um, but like, but you know, that.
*  He never struck me as a risk taker.
*  I mean, he's always going to places that look dangerous and aren't would be my.
*  Sense of what he did.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I guess maybe I kind of revisiting now in, in, in light of his
*  suicide, right, but like, that's a personality type that like, but you know,
*  but he liked to, um, he liked to drink and do drugs and eat spicy food and things
*  like that.
*  And I think, I think, I think you kind of see like a cluster and he had the, you
*  know, some obviously a penchant to travel and things like that.
*  I think you see some cluster of personality traits there.
*  Do you ever think much about how broader world history of politics and political
*  leaders may have been shaped by drugs and alcohol?
*  So there's a book about how many of the Nazi commanders were high on
*  different kinds of speed.
*  I don't know how true that is.
*  There's a book about Soviet union.
*  It's called vodka politics, Sam bankman free.
*  There's various allegations, what he was taking.
*  You see the photo of whatever on his desk.
*  How important are drugs in all of this?
*  I mean, I'm not a historian of drug culture or things like that.
*  You've talked to all these people.
*  You've thought about it, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Look, I think in the case of SBF that like drugs are maybe less a part of it in
*  some things, but look, I mean, look, I think in general, that history is often
*  quite contingent on, on very flawed human beings.
*  There's a good Matt Iglesias post about this in the context of decisions about
*  whether people run for president or not from Joe Biden, design a step down to
*  like Teddy Roosevelt and things like that.
*  And when you kind of do have some access to really smart people and kind of the
*  halls of power, I mean, people are often, are often kind of winging it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They're making usually, yeah, big decisions with limited information.
*  No second chances.
*  Really often no second chances.
*  You know, I do think that people who are risk taking tend to prevail for various
*  reasons, right?
*  Because they are the people on the, on the, on the right tail of the graph.
*  You know, I think kind of financial risk taking probably has some positive
*  correlation with risk taking as far as substance use, not that high, but maybe
*  like 0.2 or 0.3 or something like that.
*  Right.
*  So yeah, it wouldn't surprise me if more important decisions than we think in the
*  history of the world have made in various states of intoxication.
*  If the status quo bias should political leaders take drugs more?
*  You know, before Joe Biden dropped out, right?
*  I mean, it would have been a funny scandal if maybe, maybe Joe Biden should
*  have slept with the porn star, right?
*  And, and taking some shrooms, it would have like changed his, his evaluation
*  the way people viewed him a fair amount.
*  And we've had a couple of like teetotaling presidents twice in a row, which
*  is one of the, which is interesting.
*  I think I'll probably give like the standard kind of centrist left of center answer,
*  which I, you know, I think like, you know, I think that's a, that's a
*  standard answer, which I, you know, I think like, I think probably psychedelics are
*  probably, are probably for some people, pretty good, probably pretty
*  dangerous for, for other people.
*  You know, otherwise I, I, I don't know.
*  I mean, I think, I think there's probably, I think probably some people are able to
*  kind of simulate different states of consciousness in different ways naturally.
*  You know, if drugs are one way to kind of get to play, to role play a different
*  person a little bit, then, then I think that probably is helpful for
*  fair, a fair number of people.
*  Is the U S presidency now in an age of what you might call parity in NBA terms,
*  a series of one term presidents, one after the other, just like the NBA champions
*  keep on turning over and there's no dynasty.
*  So we had this long era of dynasty, you know, Bush Clinton, my
*  goodness, whatever else.
*  And now it's over and there aren't going to be repeats or what,
*  what's that going to look like?
*  So I think part of it is a result.
*  And yeah, so if Trump wins again, then it'll be limited to one term.
*  So you would therefore have three one term presidents in a row for the first time
*  since I think like, like 1892 ish, I was trying to look that up the other day.
*  So I think one thing that happened is that like the cannon, so again, I'm 46.
*  So Carter was president and I was born.
*  Right.
*  But like the kind of cannon that you emerge into when you're kind of first
*  covering politics is post-World War II.
*  Politics kind of, you know, 1946 through, through Bill Clinton, 1996 or whatever.
*  Um, that was a period of historically very low polarization in the United States.
*  I mean, you have lots of things going on, right?
*  It's like de facto three party system with Northern Democrats and
*  Republicans and Southern Democrats.
*  Um, but you know, but you had relatively low partisanship, a lot of bipartisanship.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, a lot of things are going well.
*  Things are going pretty well.
*  It's a good time for the U S um, when common presidents get reelected by, by
*  landslide margins, very often there's a lot of goodwill.
*  Um, if you go back though to like the kind of turn of the previous century.
*  So the kind of Grover Cleveland years of every year, the election is
*  separated by two points, right.
*  Um, and you bounce back and forth quite rapidly.
*  Um, like that's kind of, that's an area of era of high polarization and kind of
*  more like the era that we're in right now.
*  Um, so yeah, I mean, even before Biden's age and other problems, um, the
*  incumbency effect, if you tease out carefully has really dissipated, um, in
*  elections for Congress, we have a fairly large sample size, um, and in the
*  presidency, um, you know, you may not have two incumbent presidents in a row who
*  are voting out of office.
*  I mean, technically it will probably be Kamala now, but, um, but yeah, so, so
*  there is precedent for it, but, um, but this kind of era of comedy, this kind of
*  post world war two era of comedy that we think COM ITY, not COM EDY that we all
*  think of as being normal is actually kind of more of the, more of the outlier
*  in some ways.
*  How long will it be before we have AIs who are better predictors than you are?
*  It depends on, so it's like, let's say it's a centaur model.
*  So the AI sits down and says, Nate, you know, please talk to me for half an hour.
*  Tell me your thoughts.
*  Tell me what you know.
*  You give it your best half an hour worth of consulting on say the next
*  presidential election, and then we just get rid of you.
*  I mean, we send you out off to pasture and the AI does the work and you're
*  paid like a small fee and it does the actual prediction.
*  How far away is that?
*  I think election forecasting is kind of like a oddly hard problem where the
*  mathematical structure of it is fairly complex.
*  The data is quite sparse and you often have to make kind of judgment calls
*  based on incomplete information.
*  So that might be kind of one of the relatively more robust areas.
*  But it gets half an hour of your time, right?
*  It could pay for more if need be.
*  Okay.
*  Then where, then where's the line between like me using an AI?
*  I mean, in some ways, like the book is like, you know, in a very limited way, but
*  the book is kind of like AI enhanced and different ways, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and so look, I, I, I look, I'm not like a, I am not convinced necessarily
*  that we're going to achieve super intelligence.
*  I think it's, it's plausible ish that it kind of like, uh, plateaus at very smart.
*  Generalist human capabilities and is very good in certain areas, but, but I'm not,
*  I've become a little bit less convinced.
*  Um, just kind of in the last six months, I kind of had to send the book
*  into, to the printer basically of, of the inevitability of achieving super intelligence.
*  I mean, I think the,
*  maybe it's not super, but let's say until an AI is as good as one of Phil
*  Tatlock's super forecasters, I would say that's three to four years away.
*  It would be my guess, maybe closer to three, maybe even two.
*  What would you say?
*  I would take, I would take the over I think on that, but over as in 200 or over
*  as an, oh, it's five years away.
*  Uh, 15 or 20, 15 or 20.
*  That's a long time.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So GPT five is not going to wow you.
*  I'm look, I mean, it wows me in certain ways.
*  I mean, as someone who's kind of fascinated with, with language, right.
*  Um, you know, I'm fascinated with, with the way languages are
*  mathematicized in different ways.
*  And, you know, one of the, in the book, there is a lot on AI, including
*  like reasons to be optimistic or pessimistic about P doom.
*  Um, uh, your readers probably know what P doom is.
*  I assume.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  If they don't know they deserve P doom, right?
*  But it does seem plausible to me that like large language models reveal more
*  about the kind of mathematical structure of language than about just the
*  intelligence of, of AI, right?
*  They can now do math Olympiad problems.
*  Right?
*  So there's one forecast by someone working on this that within a year,
*  they'll win math Olympiads.
*  It could be wrong, but when you say that it's only a year away, I
*  would take that pretty seriously.
*  I think prediction is actually a pretty hard, I think.
*  Pretty hard skill that, um, that probably life experience helps.
*  I mean, you know, sometimes a prediction, right?
*  If you're trying to like predict, like you have a phone book of millions
*  of records, right?
*  And you're trying to predict, you know, what's the likelihood that this spam
*  email will be responded to and result in additional sale?
*  I mean, I'm sure like AI is already better than humans at that.
*  Um, but things that are less structured, I think are, are, are harder for
*  AI's and hard for, and hard for humans.
*  And why do businesses not seem to care that much about most predictions?
*  Surely this has puzzled you.
*  So for 20 years, I've been waiting for prediction markets to take off.
*  Obviously in politics, sports, it's more than up and running,
*  but most areas they're pretty weak.
*  What's the actual problem on the demand side?
*  I think this may be changing.
*  I mean, you know, one of the things I, I did in trying to kind of figure
*  out my next steps after, after five 38 slash Disney is, you know, the talk
*  to different financial firms and hedge funds and Wall Street firms about
*  different types of consulting arrangements.
*  Um, you know, clearly there are players in the market who were, who were
*  thinking carefully about political risk and other types of risks that you can
*  price adequately by prediction markets.
*  And I think, you know, I think there probably is some notion of critical
*  mass where you have, when you have enough kind of liquidity, um, and enough
*  volume, uh, to have relatively efficient pricing, I mean, I think we may now
*  be, you know, at that threshold, but we weren't like four years ago
*  or something like that, right?
*  Um,
*  take a truly important commercial question, like will China invade Taiwan
*  or when will they invade?
*  I've looked at different markets or pretend markets on that.
*  I just don't take those seriously.
*  It's not that I feel I have a better estimate, but they don't
*  cause much updating from me.
*  I think that the time horizons might be too long to be actionable.
*  Necessarily, um, in the same way in sports betting, um, you can probably
*  make money on futures bets, right?
*  If I were to bet right now on like who will win the NBA title in 2024 or 25.
*  Um, there are probably some plus EV bets there on the surface.
*  However, that means I would have to like tie up my, um, capital for a year.
*  Right.
*  There might also be some risk that the site I've been on goes belly up or
*  something, or that I die or something.
*  And so like, it's not, it's not, um, these long-term bets, I think are,
*  but that's not very long-term.
*  I mean, that's less than a year away and T bill rates, they're higher than
*  they were, but they're not that high.
*  You have some marginal funds and things like T bills.
*  Well, you're in good enough health.
*  You don't want to do the submersible with the billionaire.
*  Like oftentimes your edge in sports betting is like, is like two or three
*  points, right?
*  Two or 3% as an ROI.
*  So if you're like, if you know, you can put it in the S and P 500 and to make
*  8%, then it's becomes a negative EV bet.
*  But that gets back to my point.
*  People should only bet in essence on us equities and nothing else.
*  And they're sort of fooling themselves in these other areas.
*  And if they want to spend their money that way, I'm libertarian enough, but
*  I'm not that enthusiastic about it.
*  And I don't bet myself at all really on anything other than buy and
*  hold and diversify.
*  I mean, it is, it is fun.
*  So it's not fun for me somehow.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I'm a person who's never bet.
*  I go to Las Vegas.
*  I'm not even tempted.
*  I don't bet on any games.
*  I don't do slot machines.
*  Like what's wrong with me from your point of view?
*  No, it's probably, it's probably rational and, and various robust and
*  narrow senses of the term.
*  And again, I'm not somebody who's like that big on in casino gambling, but
*  like, but look, it's the intensely competitive nature of things.
*  I mean, if you look at, there's something called like an a-gram, do you know
*  this like one of the different personality?
*  Yeah.
*  Um, so the two rarest, an a-gram types are the type that, uh, the type that's
*  really analytical basically, and the type that's really competitive.
*  Um, and if I take my an a-gram chart or anagram, I'm not sure how you say it.
*  Those are the two where I have the highest scores.
*  So something about, you know, cause typically you think about, Oh, who's
*  someone who's like analytical?
*  Well, maybe they're kind of like an actuary type they're, they're calculating.
*  Um, you know, maybe they're somewhat risk-averse, maybe they're somewhat,
*  maybe they're on the verge of being like a little bit neurotic, right?
*  That's kind of the stereotype.
*  Um, and the people in the book are not that right.
*  They're analytical, but they want to like, uh, you know, look, a lot of times they
*  had things in their childhood, like a lot of people like Elon Musk or, or, um, or
*  Jeff Bezos, for example, I mean, they had childhood trauma, but not so traumatic
*  and they had enough privilege in different ways that they were able to still, you
*  know, have people take their phone calls and things like that.
*  Um, but like it's often people who, who something I think went a little bit
*  haywire and they're, and they're not necessarily kind of strictly
*  rational in some sense.
*  Last two questions first, where do you want to travel next?
*  Um, so I have a good friend who's Korean American.
*  We're hoping to go to Korea, uh, in, in December.
*  Um, we're talking about this world.
*  I've done that.
*  In fact, I love Korea.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about December.
*  I've been very little to the middle East.
*  I'd like to go, I like to go there more.
*  We're talking about Israel a little bit before.
*  Yeah.
*  Last question.
*  What is it you want to learn about next?
*  One of the problems with writing a book where you kind of take all the things
*  that you really love is that like, you kind of use a lot of your ideas.
*  I think a lot, you know, I'll give you a dumb.
*  I'd like to learn more about potlimid Omaha, which is a former poker
*  that I haven't played very much yet.
*  Yeah.
*  I have this like list of things.
*  Like I want to learn more about like, um, you know, European soccer potlimid
*  Omaha and like, and like, and like wine, basically, those are all things that I
*  think I would like very much for like, I've never quite explored fully again
*  to repeat Nate's book on the edge, the art of risking everything Nate silver.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Tyler.
