# Joseph Stiglitz on Pioneering Economic Theories, Policy Challenges, & His Intellectual Legacy  CWT
**Conversation with Tyler:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFTaS1HbgWU)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm with Joseph Stiglitz.
*  He has won a Nobel Prize in economics, and if they did such things, he could have won
*  several Nobel Prizes in economics.
*  He has a 153-page VEDA online, which is neither complete nor really has any shaft.
*  Most notably today, he has a new book out called The Road to Freedom, Economics, and
*  the Good Society.
*  Joe, welcome.
*  Nice to be here.
*  I'd like to talk about just how your career has evolved.
*  So there's an anecdote I read.
*  Your breakthrough piece, we're going back now to about 1970.
*  You're writing with Michael Rothschild on the issue of increasing risk.
*  And I read that these two pieces, they actually came from an eight-hour lecture you gave in
*  Japan.
*  Is that true?
*  Well, actually, not those two pieces, but a series of pieces on corporate governance
*  and market value maximization came from an eight-hour lecture I gave in Hakone, Japan.
*  How can you lecture for eight hours?
*  It's easier to lecture than to listen for eight hours.
*  I didn't understand that then, but I now understand it a little bit better.
*  Easier to talk than to listen.
*  Did your audience even understand you?
*  Did you have that sense?
*  Oh, I did.
*  I did.
*  I did have a sense.
*  They understood me.
*  They understood the major themes.
*  Much of what I was talking about was mathematical, and it was a more mathematically trained audience,
*  so they could follow the scribbles.
*  But I also think they could follow the idea.
*  One of the ideas was whether a firm that maximized its value, if all firms did that, would that
*  lead to the well-being of society, the well-being of welfare?
*  And the result of that was that shareholder value maximization did not, in general, lead
*  to welfare maximization.
*  And in those talks, did you outline what's sometimes called the unanimity theorem?
*  Yes, I did.
*  When shareholders agree?
*  Yes, that was one of the ideas in that long lecture.
*  And the lecture then got published in about four or five different papers, and one of
*  the papers was Sandy Grossman, was an articulation of that unanimity theorem.
*  That theorem said, what were the conditions under which all shareholders would agree with
*  each other, regardless of what their beliefs were or perceptions, just if they knew what
*  prices were?
*  And the answer was very, very restrictive conditions.
*  So when you're presenting ideas to an audience, do you find that as you talk about the idea
*  that you actually develop the idea itself, or is it simply something prepackaged and
*  it stays as it was?
*  No, every lecture is a learning experience for me.
*  I learn often questions will stimulate me to think how do other ways of other developments
*  of the idea, other aspects I hadn't thought of.
*  Most importantly, I come to understand better the mindset of the listener, how they think
*  about the topic, and then what are the difficulties, obstacles they have to understanding my perspective.
*  And in future lectures, then I can adapt my presentations to better reflect how they're
*  seeing the world and hopefully do a better job of explaining.
*  This is really part of the art of pedagogy, the art of teaching.
*  How did being a debater earlier in your life influence your intellectual career?
*  It had an enormous influence.
*  Debating was a very valuable skill in terms of organizing ideas, making you see both sides
*  of the topic because the peculiar way that debating is organized in our high schools
*  is you have to take both sides.
*  You don't know until you go to a debating tournament are you on one side or the other.
*  And of course, after you study a topic, you may wind up on one side, but you have to be
*  able to think, to understand the other side so well that you can even present their argument.
*  And so that's a really important skill.
*  The other aspect of debating that was really important for me as I was growing up is it
*  really got me interested in economics and public policy issues.
*  I still remember one of the issues that we debated way back in the 50s was should the
*  government be providing support to the agricultural sector subsidies?
*  And that's an issue that we are still debating 60 years later.
*  Okay, so you were a debater when you were at Amherst.
*  You were also head of student government, right?
*  And you voted to abolish fraternities.
*  Isn't there good evidence that fraternities raise wages?
*  That was unions raise wages.
*  Fraternities, I was opposed to fraternities because Amherst was a small college, a thousand
*  boys, men, and they had the effect of dividing the community.
*  The philosophy that I had was that we should be one community.
*  And the fraternities tended to interfere with that.
*  Students from one fraternity would always sit at dinner at the same tables with the
*  members of their fraternity.
*  There were class aspects of fraternities.
*  They were just, I thought, very divisive in a small community.
*  And it turned out that my perspective eventually prevailed.
*  A number of years later, Amherst did abolish the fraternities.
*  It's an important lesson to me in my political life.
*  Sometimes you begin a campaign knowing that in the next year, two years, while you're
*  actually there, you may not succeed.
*  But sowing the seeds of discussion, debate, maybe in five, sometimes ten, sometimes 15,
*  20 years, things turn out and you wind up winning the debate.
*  So you didn't think it was efficient t-bill clustering for networks.
*  If you hang out with a bunch of people, you get to know them very well.
*  They recommend you for jobs.
*  That's why the wage is higher.
*  Well, my view is you can hang out, you can form networks, but the way the fraternities
*  were organized was more divisive than the positive benefits that you talk about.
*  Amherst with a thousand kids, 250 in a class, our objective was to have a network of all
*  the kids working together.
*  And of course, within that, there'll be tighter clusters.
*  There are the physics majors.
*  There are the kids that are interested in sports.
*  There are multiple networks within that small group.
*  And it was tried to foster that kind of diversity of networks that we wanted to emphasize.
*  The late 1960s, for how long are you in Kenya and where are you spending your time?
*  The late 1960s, I got invited by the Rockefeller Foundation to go to Kenya just a few years
*  after it got independence.
*  In fact, if you remember the history, before independence, there was the Mao Mao attacks.
*  A lot of Europeans, colonialists got killed.
*  One night I looked under the bed I was sleeping at in Karen, which was a suburb of Nairobi,
*  and found a machete underneath there that the people who had lived there had kept there
*  to protect themselves.
*  It was striking.
*  It was an eye-opening visit, teaching, research, because one saw both the colonial heritage,
*  the fact that there weren't enough civil servants, people trained to run the government,
*  that the colonial masters had failed in their duty to enable it to be a well-functioning government.
*  And the legacy of colonialism was very present.
*  But it was also very interesting to see what it was like to live in a developing country and to think
*  very deeply about what one could do to promote development.
*  You know, I went back to Nairobi 50 years later to give a lecture at the University of Nairobi.
*  And what had happened in those 50 years was so striking.
*  Nairobi had grown from a small city to a huge metropolitan area, one of the largest in Africa.
*  The university had grown to be a very large university.
*  It was a really heartwarming event, my lecture, the response, the engagement of the students.
*  So 50 years, it was a big transformation.
*  What was it that had puzzled you about Kenyan sharecropping back then?
*  Back then, one of the issues that, of course, as public finance economists, we worried about was
*  the adverse incentive effect on taxation.
*  And if government takes 50 percent of your product, we all say, oh, that's a terrible system.
*  It discourages work.
*  And what General Sengs in the United States says is that even the top rate shouldn't be higher than 40 percent.
*  I think that's wrong. But that was certainly a sentiment, a very strong sentiment.
*  Well, here you had sharecropping not only in Kenya, but many other countries around the world,
*  where one half to two thirds of the produce was taken by the landlord.
*  That was equivalent to a tax of 50 to 67 percent.
*  And yet this was a prevalent form of tenancy, a way that people, the arrangement that they had with the landlord.
*  And one had to ask, why was that?
*  How could this seemingly inefficient system persist for thousands of years?
*  And that was what motivated one of my most influential papers.
*  That was the idea that there was a risk incentive tradeoff,
*  that in the absence of perfect information and presence of a lot of risk,
*  farmers couldn't bear the risk of land ownership.
*  If they owned the land or rented the land more accurately, they rented the land,
*  they'd have to absorb all the residual, the fluctuations in the weather and all the other fluctuations, disease that would they would confront.
*  And with sharecropping, they divided that risk and a lot of the risk was borne by the landlord.
*  And that was a model of what came to be called the principal agent problem.
*  It's part of the incentive model that now is really fundamental.
*  It was a first formalization of that basic incentive model that is now basic to modern economics.
*  And is some of that that the landowner was providing fertilizer, machinery,
*  that there's a principal agent problem on both sides and you need to weigh off the marginal incentives?
*  Or was it just monopolization of the land?
*  No, it included, I had a separate paper where I looked at this issue,
*  several papers where I looked at the role of the landlord in providing seed fertilizer and credit.
*  And what was called interlinking of markets.
*  You might ask again, why not have separate markets for credit, separate markets for seed, for milling the grain at the end of the harvest?
*  And the answer was that in the presence of these incentive problems,
*  it turned out to be efficient to have this kind of integration of these various activities.
*  And that for instance, by providing the right kind of seed, subsidizing the seed, maybe subsidizing the fertilizer,
*  the landlord could elicit more effort on the part of the tenant.
*  And that was a good thing, because on his own, the tenant had less incentive to work because he was being taxed
*  effectively by 50% because 50% of his effort went to the benefit of the landlord.
*  So it became a whole theory of rural organization.
*  What is it you think of Henry George and George's economics today?
*  Well, that was another set of articles that I wrote in the late 70s.
*  Concerning the land rents associated with the cities.
*  You have a city, it has transportation costs.
*  It's expensive to go from the fringes of the city to the center where economic activity occurs.
*  And people want to pay more for being closer to the center.
*  And I developed a whole theory of the rents that would arise in that kind of a context,
*  as people facing costly transportation would bid up the price of land.
*  And then I asked the question, what is the relationship between the optimal size of the city,
*  the optimal spending on public goods by the city, and the rents that were generated in the way I just described?
*  And there was a remarkable theorem that came out, which was that if you have optimal size cities,
*  and you tax the rents 100%, that would be exactly the right amount to finance the optimal amount of public goods.
*  It was a very theoretical idea, but it captured an important idea that Henry George,
*  who was one of the great economists of the 19th century, had enunciated, which was
*  taxing land rents was the efficient way, the most efficient way, for raising revenues.
*  And is that true today? For a given level of taxation, do you think we should take more of it from landlords?
*  Yes, I think the ownership of land still provides one of the most important bases of taxation,
*  and we almost surely do not tax it as much as we should.
*  When the government, say in the New York City, builds a subway, those near the subway have enormous increase,
*  windfall gain from the value of their land. You can actually document the land goes up.
*  The city is paying, all the citizens are paying for it, and yet the owners of the land get a windfall.
*  Now, one of the difficulties in practice is the following, that the theory applied to the
*  ground rent, the real value of the land, and property taxes apply both to the land
*  and the buildings that are built on top of them. And differentiating between the two
*  is not always an easy matter. So this is a general principle in taxation. Again, something
*  my economics of information try to clarify, that one of the principles of taxation is to try to,
*  it's often difficult to identify the real variables that you would like to tax,
*  and this is an example of that. Do you favor the deregulations of the current
*  Yimby movement, allow a lot more building? No, that goes actually to one of the themes of my book.
*  One of the themes in my book is one person's freedom is somebody person's unfreedom.
*  And that means that what I can do, I talk about freedom as what somebody could do,
*  his opportunities, his choices that he could make. And when one person exerts an externality on
*  another by exerting his freedom, he's constraining the freedom of others. So if you have unfettered
*  building, for instance, you don't have any zoning, you can have a building as high as you want.
*  The problem is that your high building deprives another building of light.
*  There may be noise, you don't want your children exposed to, say, a brothel that is created next
*  door. And some people in the book, I actually talk about one example, Houston is a city with
*  relatively little zoning, and I have some quotes from people living there describing some of the
*  challenges that that results in. Now, when you're young, you spend some time at Cambridge University,
*  what was it like being tutored by Joan Robinson? Joan Robinson was one of the great economists
*  of the last century. She was, you might say, very idiosyncratic. She had a peculiar set of beliefs
*  that got more peculiar as she got older. When she was younger, she did some fantastic economic work,
*  theory of monopoly, trying to understand the role of monopolies in our economy.
*  But as she got older, she got more, she was very supportive of the Cultural Revolution
*  in China. So you could imagine when I went to Cambridge as a Fulbright scholar, she was assigned
*  as my tutor. One of the reasons she was assigned as my tutor was that when I went to Cambridge on
*  this Fulbright, the Department of Economics had to discuss whether I would be accepted.
*  And her view was that my mind had been ruined by two years at MIT.
*  You were too right wing, right, for her?
*  I was too right wing and I had to start not as a graduate student, I had to be deprogrammed
*  by beginning as a first year undergraduate. And there had been a fierce fight in the faculty
*  at Cambridge about whether I should be accepted as a Fulbright graduate student. And those arguments
*  on that that I should prevail, but the quid pro quo was that she would be my tutor.
*  Well, you can imagine I learned a lot from her, I came to understand better her way of thinking.
*  But after eight weeks, we parted and I got another tutor, Frank Hahn.
*  One thing that's striking to me about the arc of your career, if I think geographically where
*  you've been, well, you start in Gary, Indiana, there's Amherst, there's MIT, there's Kenya,
*  there's Yale, there's Cambridge, there's Oxford, there's Princeton, there's Boston University,
*  there's Columbia, there's seven years in Washington. I'm sure I've left some out.
*  But being in so many different places, how has that influenced what you've produced and what
*  you've thought? And why didn't you just stay at MIT your whole life? Surely you had that option.
*  Yes, but you could have asked why didn't I just stay in Gary? As a young person,
*  I sort of read about this big world outside of Gary. And I just wanted to see it. And as I went
*  to Amherst, my eyes opened up more and I wanted to see more. I just had this thirst for seeing
*  more and more of the world. And the more I saw of it, the more I wanted.
*  And that had an enormous influence. I think coming from Gary, Indiana, gave me a kind of empathy
*  for those who didn't start at the top in life. It certainly made me much more interested in
*  development. Gary was beginning to go through the process of de-development
*  that we'd see over the next 30 years after I left. It was sort of the epitome of de-industrialization
*  in the United States. So I think it affected me, made my career very different, affected my
*  economics in a lot of ways. I was more concerned about inequality than most of my colleagues.
*  I wrote my thesis on inequality. It's been a thread throughout my career. I wrote in 2012
*  the book The Price of Inequality and a couple years later The Price of the Great Divide.
*  The good news is with that long arc, the economics profession, our society, is finally catching up on
*  coming to terms, recognizing the importance of studying inequality and the important role that
*  inequality plays in creating the great divides in our society.
*  Steve McLaughlin And Paul Samuelson also was from Gary, right? And the Jackson Five.
*  Paul Samuelson That's right. That's right. It was an impressive,
*  you might say impressive trio in the library in Gary, Indiana. There's a mural that they made
*  recently. I went back to Gary just a few years ago and they were very proud to show me the
*  role in which the Jackson Five, Paul Samuelson and me are both, are all on that mural.
*  Steve McLaughlin Something else striking about your career that I noticed
*  reviewing for this podcast. This is especially at a time when co-authorship is not nearly as normal
*  as it is now. The number of distinct co-authors you have, and they're each famous in their own
*  right. So there's Michael Rothschild, there's Avinash Dixit, Sandy Grossman, Tony Atkinson,
*  Carl Shapiro, Andrew Weiss, Greenwald. I'm sure there's others I've forgotten about.
*  I don't see anyone else doing that. There's people who have standing co-authors like there's
*  Sargent and Wallace for a while. But what led you to have this pattern of co-authorship and
*  how has that shaped your thought? Paul Samuelson
*  Well, quite frankly, I like interacting with other people. I think I'm a social person.
*  And I've been lucky, you might say, to bubble up with ideas. And I share those ideas with other
*  people, you know, over dinner, over lunch, in the coffee room. And then we start talking and those
*  ideas start gelling and we wind up writing a paper together. And I've always felt that
*  we each of us have something to contribute. Many of my co-authors bring a lot of mathematical skills
*  to the table, but many of them bring other skills, empirical skills. So I've been just very, very
*  lucky. Some of these, like Andy Weiss, having students of mine, Avinash Raverman, we're students.
*  And we would start talking about ideas as I try to guide them in their PhD. And when they finish
*  their PhD, there are a whole set of other ideas that we haven't fully developed in their thesis.
*  And so we start working together in a whole set of papers that follow on.
*  Steve McLaughlin If I think about your 1980 piece with Sandy
*  Grossman, what are your current views on why trading volume is so high? It seems to
*  violate a lot of rationality theorems. Well, if someone's trading with you, you might plausibly
*  assume they know at least as much as you do. Fisher Black famously said, we just need to put
*  trading in the utility function. That's a kind of deus machina. What do you think now, 44 years later?
*  Andy Weiss Well, I think the basic idea of
*  that paper is still obviously correct. The title of that paper was The Impossibility of
*  Informationally Efficient Markets. And it was an argument against the view that was held by
*  people like Eugene Fama that markets were informationally efficient, that they transmitted
*  efficiently all the information from the informed to the uninformed. We made the obvious observation
*  that if that were the case, there would be no incentive for anybody to gather information.
*  So the market might be transmitting information, but it would be all free information. It would
*  be information that nobody had done any work to collect. And that idea actually in another
*  context worries me very much today that with Google and AI scraping so much information
*  off of our newspapers, off of our
*  podcasts, off of everything they can get a hold of, they're trying to appropriate the value of
*  the knowledge that's been created by other people without paying for it. So if they succeed in doing
*  that, of course that will decrease the incentives for others to produce information of high quality
*  and of value. So it's that kind of interaction that was at the heart of our 1980 paper. And
*  the themes that we talked about there are still the critical themes that we're talking about today.
*  Do you think today that liquidity from market makers is oversupplied or undersupplied relative
*  to a social optimum? Say in New York. Well, the issue here turned out to be
*  the measurement of liquidity is very difficult. A lot of the liquidity are these
*  fast traders, last traders, people are in the market for a moment. And we saw that in a couple of the
*  crashes that we've had. It seems like there's a lot of liquidity, but then all of a sudden when you
*  have a big event, that liquidity rise up. Part of what is going on, let's be frank, is computers
*  trading with other computers. And so it's not informed people trading with uninformed people.
*  It's really computers with one body of data trying to make a micro cent from another trader. And they
*  each are going back and forth very fast. They're trying to elicit information. It's not trading
*  for holding a position. It's trading to elicit information.
*  But as the spreads widen, why doesn't someone with a lot of capital just step in and earn that
*  spread? It would seem there's a self-correcting aspect to this if you have high enough capitalization.
*  Well, what I was going to say is what happens is that at those critical moments when
*  we really need liquidity, the market freezes. We've had some very bad days of that kind.
*  And that at that particular moment, markets may not even clear. And actually, they cease to
*  function. And when they cease to function, nobody wants to come in.
*  So it's not just that there's a spread. They're just not functioning. And you don't know when
*  you make a trade whether it actually will be... You think you made a trade, but it may not actually
*  eventually be executed. So we are in this very precarious world where most of the time the
*  market works, a lot of seeming liquidity, but it's a liquidity that can dry up just when we need it.
*  Now, you have a very famous 1977 paper with Dixit. And one of the things you show in that paper is
*  there's a coherent way to model firms that A, face downward sloping demand curves, but B,
*  don't have to worry very much about what other firms are doing, a kind of monopolistic competition.
*  People have since used that as a rationale for strategic trade policy.
*  Do you agree with that use of the model? Or what qualifications would you add?
*  Well, I think that model is a way of thinking about, as you said, the ability,
*  a world in which there's some market power, but limited market power. Each of the firms themselves
*  doesn't have to worry about strategic interaction. In my mind, the more critical issues in strategic
*  trade policy that we're facing today are not those that Paul Krugman argued for based on our
*  monopolistic competition model some quarter century ago, and for which he got the Nobel Prize,
*  working off of our model. It's really about dynamics, learning, and resilience.
*  So today, the critical issue in trade policy is US CHIPS Act, the IRA. The CHIPS Act was
*  worried about, we had lost the ability to make CHIPS. That meant that if anything happened to
*  Taiwan or Korea, we were in a very vulnerable position. Markets don't take into account that
*  kind of defense concern, or even the resilience. That goes back to some of my earlier work,
*  that markets aren't very good at assessing risk and pricing in risk into the decision-making
*  process. So here we are, 2023, 2024, and we feel very vulnerable because of this potential lack of
*  resilience, which would be disastrous if there were a war between Taiwan and China.
*  So that is the argument for our current industrial policies, which are a almost clear violation of
*  the WTO rules. And then the IRA Act is another example where we have a strategic trade policy
*  to help move the economy towards a green transition and worry that we were falling behind
*  in learning about the new green technologies. Now there are a couple of important issues
*  on this that are very much related to the themes of my book, and that is what one person does,
*  or one country does, can harm another person or another country. So here we're trying to grab
*  more jobs for us in this green transition, but the developing countries and emerging markets
*  don't have the resources to engage in that kind of policy. And even Europe has complained about
*  the fact that we seemingly are succeeding in getting firms that were going to build factories
*  in Europe shifting to the United States. So our success in some of these areas comes at the
*  expense of others. So the old model of trade was everybody can benefit. Some of the things we're
*  doing are clearly benefiting us at the expense of others, and that's why you need a rules-based
*  order. This point about trade aside, at a conceptual level, what do you think would be the
*  biggest difference between you and Paul Krugman? Two very well-known writers, broadly you would
*  each be placed on the left, but how do you two think about the world differently? I think that
*  he thinks that monetary policy has a bigger role than I think it does. And you think it's credit,
*  or you think it's real factors at this point in time? I think what matters is not the money
*  supply, not the interest rate, it's the credit availability of monetary policy. So it's the
*  mechanism, and that what we saw in 2008, that providing so much liquidity to the banking system
*  didn't help that much, that the banks were very reluctant to lend out that money, and therefore
*  the recovery was a very slow recovery. We would have been better off if we had relied more on
*  fiscal policy than on monetary policy. So that, I think, is maybe from an analytic point of view,
*  the main distinction that I think I've discovered in our work. Now your best-sided piece is your 1981
*  article with Andy Weiss on credit rationing, which is a macroeconomic idea. But do you think
*  that since then the real problem has more often been we've thrown too much credit at things? So
*  the housing bubble, the student loan crisis, wouldn't we have been better off with a lot more
*  credit rationing? Well, the issue here was that we weren't very good at credit allocation,
*  and that we thought, let the market rip. We lowered interest rates, we deregulated,
*  so we didn't look at where the credit was going. The bank supervisors, the Federal Reserve is
*  supposed to oversee, and there are actually several other supervisors that are supposed to oversee the
*  riskiness of the lending, and that's where the fault came. Now one of the things that I've,
*  when I was at the World Bank and since then, have emphasized very heavily, one of the signs
*  that there's a problem in the credit allocation is when you see a very rapid increase in the credit
*  in one particular area. It's a sign that probably people aren't paying enough attention, and
*  particularly when we saw the increase in credit to housing, we should have been worried.
*  And as it turned out, the banks weren't doing the kind of diligence that they should have done.
*  They were passing on these mortgages onto investors, effectively lying, committing fraud,
*  and there have been a lot of cases of this where they said, well, we've been very careful.
*  We've inspected these mortgages of originating in owner-occupied homes, people with this income.
*  They hadn't done any of that, and all of that contributed to the financial crisis of 2008.
*  So the issue isn't the amount of credit, it was the allocation of credit.
*  If they had used that credit for productive uses, how much better our economy would have been?
*  Well, we built a lot of homes, right? It's turned out we've needed them.
*  The home prices that looked crazy in 2006 now seem somewhat reasonable.
*  A lot of them were built in the wrong place and were shoddy. I used to joke that there were
*  huge numbers of homes built in the Nevada desert, and the only good thing about them
*  is they were built so shoddily that they won't last that long.
*  Your 1984 piece with Carl Shapiro on efficiency wage theory, looking back at that now 40 years
*  later, do you think of that mainly as a contribution to understanding organizations,
*  an explanation of unemployment, a claim about sticky wages? How do you frame that article?
*  Because in the piece itself, the wage is actually flexible, at least the real wage is.
*  Well, actually, it really is an argument that to understand how labor markets work
*  and how they work, or any market for that market, because we look at the labor market,
*  but we point out it's true of product markets, one has to take on board the fact that there's
*  imperfect information and in that particular case, imperfect monitoring of what workers are doing,
*  and that you have to have an incentive to make sure that they work well, and that one aspect
*  of the incentive is that there have to be consequences when they don't work well.
*  And one of the thesis of that paper is that the standard articulation of what free markets like
*  are just wrong. So for instance, the standard view was that demand for labor was equal to the
*  supply of labor, there's no unemployment. And what we point out is if you couldn't monitor labor,
*  at every moment of time, workers would have an incentive to shirk. The worst that could happen
*  to them is they would be fired. But if they were fired with no unemployment, they'd be hired the
*  next moment. So there'd be no incentive to work. So that as part of that equilibrium, there had to
*  be some unemployment to induce people not to shirk. Now, there are many other mechanisms,
*  and in a later work we'll try to talk about, there are other aspects of what was called the
*  efficiency wage model, where you have to pay enough to induce people to produce and to work hard,
*  that there are other aspects of the labor market as an institution where the rewards are done over
*  the long term. I think I maybe overemphasize the role of unemployment as an incentive device,
*  but the critique of the standard model I think is still there. And the importance of
*  of taking a broader view of the labor market is still there.
*  From 1986 until about 1990, you wrote a series of papers with SA on information architectures,
*  hierarchies versus polyarchies, type one versus type two errors.
*  Then the 1990s come and you spend, I think, about seven years working in different roles in
*  Washington, D.C. How did that cause you to revise what you had done with SA?
*  Well, I had never been in a real hierarchy at the time I wrote those papers. Those papers were
*  asking the question, what are the relative merits in decision making when you have a hierarchy where
*  decision has to be proved by one person after another versus what we often think of as the
*  merit of a decentralized economy where you have many, many, many different decision makers and
*  you let each of them take their chance. Underneath this was the idea that all human decision-making,
*  all humans are fallible. There's going to be some cases of approving good projects,
*  of disapproving good projects, and some cases of approving bad projects.
*  How do you balance the two and how different systems strain out bad projects without straining
*  out good projects? Well, when I came to live in a world of hierarchy, which was what I saw in
*  Washington, I came to both appreciate why in some circumstances you had that hierarchy,
*  but I think I came to appreciate even more the virtues of decentralization, what I call
*  polyarchy. I guess I became more of a critique critic of hierarchy. I saw too many cases where
*  there was too much fallibility built in and too many good ideas got screened out by the hierarchy,
*  and hierarchies when the guys at the top are not good decision makers are particularly problematic.
*  Should the World Bank right now be emphasizing climate change as they seem to be doing?
*  A lot of the poorer nations have complained. They say it's not their priority. They actually
*  want to use more energy, some of which will be dirty energy. What's your view on that?
*  I think the World Bank's emphasis on climate change is important, is critical.
*  Climate is a public good from which everybody, it's a global public good from which all of us
*  will benefit, and most especially those in the developing world and emerging markets,
*  which disproportionately are located along the tropics, and those are going to be most
*  adversely affected if we have the kind of climate change that will occur if we don't curb the
*  emissions of carbon, of greenhouse gases. It's in their interest that these be curbed.
*  Now, we are at a lucky time for them because over the last 15 years, the price of renewable
*  energy has come down 90% or more. In fact, at the current time, by moving to renewable energy,
*  which is actually more decentralizable, you have fewer of these big-makeup projects,
*  developing countries actually, I think, can do more smaller projects better. I think they're
*  really advantaged by going more and more towards renewable energy.
*  One of the things that I've done, a more recent paper that I've written with Nick Stern,
*  Hadaville, Stern report, which was written at the UK about moving them along the green transition,
*  was that growth and a green transition are very compatible.
*  That actually making an early move to the green transition is actually a pro-growth move for
*  developing countries and emerging markets. To me, that kind of tension, which they argue,
*  I think is a mis-framing of the issue. I understand their view that the whole issue is inflicted on
*  them because the advanced countries put so much carbon into the atmosphere since the beginning
*  industrial revolution. I understand their sense of grievance, but right now, actually, the
*  developing countries and emerging markets are the larger emitter of greenhouse gases. They really
*  have a responsibility and we're not going to address climate change unless they're on board.
*  Climate change is a real example of the major theme of my book, On the Road to Freedom.
*  It's a real case where one country's freedom imposes a cost on others, where the freedom to
*  pollute really does constrain what others can do. If we have more pollution, we're going to get more
*  desertification, we're going to get more floods, more droughts. It is probably one of the most
*  important examples of how the expansion of freedom by some constrains that of others.
*  What's your current view of Hugo Chavez, who is not himself in every way pro-green?
*  Well, he's no longer on the scene, but...
*  But shouldn't we be glad he's gone? I'm very glad he's gone. I think he was terrible. He
*  contributed to ruining a whole country.
*  That's right. I think he has. And the cost to his society, particularly even more of his successor,
*  has been enormous. I actually think it's had an enormous cost to the whole,
*  I would say, Western hemisphere because the flood of migrants from Venezuela, just finding a place
*  to live a decent life, has created problems of migration and affected the politics of much of
*  North and South America.
*  Poland is now converging on Western European living standards. Does that show that shock
*  therapy simply can work if you stick with it? I mean, that would be my conclusion.
*  Can you say that again? Poland is now converging on Western European living standards.
*  Does that show that shock therapy can work, provided you stick with it?
*  No, I think it shows quite the opposite. I've had a lot of discussions with the architecture,
*  architects of Poland's, you might call it, miracle. The reason Poland is the most successful
*  of the Eastern European countries are several, but it wasn't the shock therapy that had such a
*  negative macroeconomic effect. It was the fact that after that moment of shock, they began
*  a very, a gradualistic policy of reform, of creating the institutional infrastructure
*  that is the basis of the market economy. They were lucky that the EU embraced them
*  and the EU, as they became part of the EU, they got, you might say, the legal framework that
*  is necessary for a well-functioning market from the EU. They had a lot of migrants from Poland
*  that went to UK and around Europe that then brought back skills and money back to Poland.
*  And it was really their walking away from shock therapy after a very short period and moving to
*  this gradualist policy that was the foundation of their success in this now three decades since
*  the beginning of the transition from communism to a market economy.
*  You're known as a big fan of reading fiction. Is there a work of fiction you would care to
*  recommend to us all, something you've been reading lately?
*  That's a good question. Most recently I've been busy writing this book and, as you may know,
*  writing a book takes a lot of time. I suppose some books that
*  I've always found reading books from the third world, authors writing about Kenya, about
*  Nigeria, really ones that I find particularly interesting because they give me insights into
*  the countries that I've been so engaged in, in another way, through my economics.
*  Final question. What will you do next?
*  I'm sure you'll write another book.
*  But on what?
*  Well, I think there are many themes in this book and in my previous book, People, Power, and
*  Prophets, where I didn't have time or space to fully articulate my views.
*  I think the problem of rank seeking, which I talked about in The Price of Inequality and I
*  talked about in People, Power, and Prophets, has become an increasingly important issue.
*  It has meant that there's a big divergence of what gives rise to the wealth of nations
*  and what gives rise to the wealth of particular individuals. Trying to understand
*  what is in the 21st century the basis of the wealth of nations and what gives rise
*  in the 21st century to the wealth of individuals and how they're similar and how they're different
*  seems to me a very interesting question that I want to think about.
*  Just to repeat for our audience, the new book is The Road to Freedom, Economics, and the Good
*  Society. Joe Stiglitz, thank you very much. Nice to be here.
