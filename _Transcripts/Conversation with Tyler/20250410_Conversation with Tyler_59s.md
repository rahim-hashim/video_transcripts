Video Description: When Jennifer Pahlka suggested a smaller defense budget would create a safer America, she expected resistance from the senior Air Force official sitting nearby. Instead, he stunned everyone by agreeingâ€”and going further. "You're right, except it needs to be 50%," he explained, noting that only major system shocks truly drive change in defense systems.

Recorded March 4th, 2025.

# Small budgetary cuts don't shock the system | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g)
*  I told a story about being at an event where the person next to me is one of these events [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=0.0s)]
*  where people are off the record and this person was a pretty senior official in the Air Force. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=6.84s)]
*  And I said that I thought we would have a safer country with a smaller defense budget. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=12.56s)]
*  And people look at me and they're like, oh, she's a hippie or something. She just doesn't [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=20.0s)]
*  care about her national defense. I spent four years on the Defense Innovation Board and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=23.2s)]
*  I learned to care a lot about our defense and to be quite worried about it. I felt a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=27.12s)]
*  little awkward saying this next to this Air Force official because it sounds insulting. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Like I want to cut your budget. And he turned to me and he's in front of everyone. He said, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=36.88s)]
*  you're right, except it needs to be 50 percent because when we've had 15 or 20 percent cuts, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=41.28s)]
*  it doesn't shock the system enough to actually change behavior. Of course, you can have a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=47.56s)]
*  cut like that would be a shock to the system. A hot war would be a shock to the system. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=51.56s)]
*  We all know we will see change when that happens. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_JOD5kZL8g&t=56.12s)]
