# "You canâ€™t say the ruler suffices." | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c)
*  You need measurement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=0.0s)]
*  How do you get measurement without consciousness? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=1.16s)]
*  What does measurement even mean, absent consciousness? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=3.96s)]
*  Electrons bump into each other, something. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=6.92s)]
*  You don't need consciousness. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=8.84s)]
*  But again, the essence- [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=10.36s)]
*  If you had a measuring stick in there, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  that would collapse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=12.76s)]
*  Who puts the measuring stick in there? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=13.76s)]
*  Humans, but when they're not watching, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=15.96s)]
*  the wave function still collapses, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=17.44s)]
*  Why, does it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  The measuring stick says it does. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=20.88s)]
*  But we made the measuring stick. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=22.32s)]
*  But we're not watching. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=23.92s)]
*  You don't need subjective consciousness. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=24.92s)]
*  You need some process of resolution. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=26.84s)]
*  I deny that you can have a measuring stick [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=28.68s)]
*  without a process of consciousness. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=30.68s)]
*  The measuring stick without a process of consciousness [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=32.2s)]
*  is itself just a ruler, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=34.6s)]
*  Absent your consciousness, a ruler is a collection [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=38.44s)]
*  of atoms and molecules cut out of a tree [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  with some markings on it, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=44.36s)]
*  In order for the ruler to be an instrument of measurement, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  you, Tyler Cowen, have to be perceiving it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=49.56s)]
*  and be conscious of it, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=52.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think the ruler suffices. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=53.6s)]
*  In fact, I mean, I want it just to go, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=55.28s)]
*  no, you can't say the ruler suffices. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfb6GlP6a8c&t=57.76s)]
