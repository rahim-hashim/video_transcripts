# Balancing brain surgery and married life | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg)
*  Why do so many neurosurgeons get divorced? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=0.0s)]
*  I think it's the same thing. You know, when you have a career where not only are you out of the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=2.56s)]
*  house for a long time and you get called out of the house at awkward times, so that could be on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=8.48s)]
*  Valentine's Day, right? That could be at two in the morning. But even when you're there, even when [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  you're at home, there's part of you that's always absent. You know, one thing that I realized is no [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=21.04s)]
*  matter where I am, there's always part of me that's thinking about the patients that are in the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=27.36s)]
*  hospital that I operated on last week and how they're doing. And maybe one of them is, you know, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=32.08s)]
*  struggling a little bit and I have to be aware of that. And I'm thinking about the patients I'm [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=36.56s)]
*  going to operate on next week and the challenging cases coming up and how those are going to go. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  And I'm visualizing them in advance constantly. The past and the future of what you do is weighing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=46.64s)]
*  on you all the time so that even when you're present at home, you're not fully present at home. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=53.28s)]
*  It's just a very demanding career. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-51hlcBFjgg&t=57.92s)]
