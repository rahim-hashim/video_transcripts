# David Bentley Hart on Reason, Faith, and Diversity in Religious Thought  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [July 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEhNqTuD0Q)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm very pleased to be chatting with David Bentley Hart.
*  How to describe David Bentley Hart?
*  Well, the person I know whom I consider to be the best read is David Gordon, and David
*  Gordon thinks that David Bentley Hart is the best read person he knows.
*  David Bentley Hart is an American writer, philosopher, religious studies scholar, critic,
*  and theologian.
*  He has authored over 1,000 essays, reviews, and papers, not to mention 19 books, including
*  a very well-known translation of the New Testament.
*  The topics he writes on include Christian metaphysics, Orthodox Christianity, philosophy
*  of mind, Indian and East Asian religions, Asian languages, classics, literature, music,
*  and more.
*  David, welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Now I have to live up to that introduction.
*  If you could explain to me as simply as possible, in which ways is Orthodox Christianity not
*  so very millenarian?
*  Well, it depends on what you mean by millenarian.
*  I'd have to ask you to be a bit more...
*  Say the Protestant 17th century sense, that the world is on the verge of a very radical
*  transformation that will herald in some completely new age, and we all should be prepared for
*  it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, in one sense, it's been the case of Christianity from the first century, that
*  it's always existed in a kind of time between times, right?
*  There's always this sense of being in history, but always expecting an imminent interruption
*  of history.
*  But Orthodoxy has been around for a while.
*  It's part of an indurated culture, grounded originally in the Eastern Greco-Roman world,
*  and has a huge apparatus of philosophy and theology.
*  And I think just over the centuries has learned to be patient.
*  The notion, the sort of Protestant millenarianism you speak of, always seems to have been born
*  out of historical crisis, in a sense.
*  The rise of the nation-state, the fragmentation of the Western Church, it's always as much
*  an effect of history as a flight from history, whereas I think it's fair to say that Orthodoxy
*  has sort of created for itself a kind of parallel world just outside the flow of history.
*  It puts much more of an emphasis on the spiritual life, mysticism, that sort of thing.
*  And as such, whereas it still uses the language, the recognizable language of the imminent
*  return of Christ, it's not at the center of the spiritual life.
*  And how does that theological patience shape the polities of Orthodox Christian nations
*  and regions?
*  How does that matter?
*  Well, it's been both good and bad, to be honest.
*  I mean, at its best, Orthodoxy has cultivated a spiritual life that nourished millions and
*  it puts an emphasis upon moral obligation to others and the life of charity and the
*  ascetical virtues of Christianity, the self-denial.
*  At its worst, however, it's often been an accommodation with historical forces that
*  are antithetical to the Gospel, too.
*  I mean, it's often been the case that Orthodoxy has been so, let's say, disenchanted with
*  the millenarian expectation that it's become a prop of the state.
*  And you can see today in Russia, in which you have a church institution, this isn't
*  to speak of the faithful themselves, but the institutional authority of the state, of the
*  institution, rather, of the church, more or less being nothing but a propaganda wing of
*  an authoritarian and terrorist government.
*  So it's had both its good and its bad consequences over the centuries.
*  At its best, as I say, it encourages a true spiritual life that can teach one to be detached
*  from ambitions and expectations and the sort of violent projects of the ego, but at its
*  worst, it can become a passive participant in precisely those sorts of projects and those
*  sorts of evils.
*  LARSON How would you say your study of Heidegger has deepened your understanding of Christian
*  Orthodoxy?
*  LARSON Of Heidegger? Well...
*  LARSON Heidegger, right?
*  LARSON Yeah.
*  LARSON Who you understand quite well.
*  LARSON Well, he's one of them, yeah, the philosophers over there.
*  Well, now there you're dealing, I have to admit, this question comes a little out of
*  left field, but with me, I never know which aspect of my work someone might be interested
*  in at any given moment. But with Heidegger, it's a very ambiguous figure, of course, but
*  he certainly was putting aside his own incredible moral defects. For those who don't know, he was
*  a member for a while of the Nazi party, as much out of cowardice as anything else, but I think
*  out of early on at least some degree of sympathy. But when he wasn't being evil, he was a very
*  reflective philosopher on how we have arrived at what he considered an age of nihilism,
*  of sort of an age that values the will to power, the will to power over physical environment above
*  all other things without any sense of the mystery of being, the piety of not trying to grasp
*  and control and reduce all of reality to instrumentality and utility.
*  And he tells a very powerful story about the genealogy of Western nihilism, how we went,
*  how we arrived at what he calls the age of technology in which everything is simply a
*  project of the will and the whole of the world is nothing but a reserve of resources to be exploited
*  for the purpose of acquisition and for the purposes of the will. Now, I don't agree with
*  the whole story, but as I say, it makes one think about the genealogy of the way we see the world
*  and see the world as desacralized and disenchanted. And that much of the appeal of, I suppose,
*  Eastern orthodoxy to me in my youth was precisely that it was a Christian tradition that emphasized
*  precisely the sense of cosmic mystery of Christ and the cosmic mystery of the revelation of God
*  in all things. And it put this great emphasis on the notion that the heart of Christian thought
*  is the idea of deification, of union with God, of the whole creation renewed in some
*  unimaginable way so that a very popular image goes, so that the whole universe is like a burning
*  bush shining with the glory of God but not consumed. So I would say that if there is any
*  connection there, and since no one's ever asked me this before, I'm not sure there is, but if there
*  is, then you can see how someone who takes seriously the genealogy of nihilism that someone
*  like Heidegger unfolds might be drawn to a very robust, among Christian traditions, a very robust
*  depiction of a kind of glorified reality in which the entire cosmos
*  participates in the sacred mystery.
*  You mentioned questions out of left field. Who played left field for the Baltimore Orioles in 1970?
*  Merv Retemund, or let's see, there would also be Don Buford sometimes played left. I'm trying
*  to remember. Paul Blair was in center still, and that was the last year that Frank Robinson was in
*  right field. So if my memory is correct, it was usually Merv Retemund or maybe the young Don
*  Baylor was up then. I'm getting old now. Do you know? I think of it as Buford, you know, Blair in
*  center, Robinson in right, but I'm not entirely sure either. Well, I think in left field, Earl
*  Weaver was one of the first really to platoon players, and sometimes Buford actually played
*  the infield. He was a much more versatile player. But yeah, I think Retemund was still on the team
*  too. So let's say you're trying to explain to a Catholic in metaphysical terms where orthodoxy
*  diverges from Catholicism, not the history, not different views on the papacy, but fundamental,
*  underlying conceptual differences on metaphysics in as few dimensions as possible. Where do you see
*  that difference? In as few dimensions as possible? Well, for one thing, there's no history of the
*  notion of inherited guilt. The whole idea of sin is very different. We're sort of born into a state
*  of alienation from God and from the world and from our neighbor is a common Christian idea.
*  But in the West, mostly just as a result of certain translation issues, but also because of
*  the very powerful influence of the late Augustine on the development of Western theology, there came
*  that somehow one is born in a state of guilt, which to be honest was often was considered
*  repugnant in the East. Also, there was no theology then of predestination. This is often also regarded
*  and there was in Western Catholicism, albeit it's a doctrine without a strict definition.
*  It remains on the books, but unlike Calvinism, Roman Catholicism doesn't insist that it knows
*  what predestination means. But the real big difference, I suppose then the greatest
*  difference would be the theology of grace. I mean that in the West, it became more and more the case
*  that grace was sort of treated as antithetical to nature. Grace was a principle over against nature.
*  It was therefore given according to a kind of purely predilective predestined will of God,
*  whereas in the East that kind of opposition between grace and nature simply never took root.
*  Grace was just a word for the way God deals with creatures and it was seen as more continuous with
*  nature, that we're always already naturally oriented to union with God and that it's an
*  unnatural impediment that separates us from God rather than a failure to receive
*  a super elevating grace. Grace is, how do I put it this, in Western tradition grace became a very
*  extraordinary gift, whereas in the East it remained an ordinary reality from which we were
*  extraordinarily separated by a tragic history that had to be overcome.
*  Does the relative lack of counterpoint in Eastern Orthodox Church music
*  correspond to anything theological or is that just historical accident?
*  Well it depends on which church you're talking about. Contrapuntal polyphonic music actually
*  has a very rich history in the West, in the Russian and the Slavic tradition especially
*  from the time of Bortnansky and others onward. I don't think so, no. Those sorts of differences,
*  those sorts of accidental differences, they were the things that Orthodox polemicists like to focus
*  on. Every little difference becomes a difference of incredible magnitude for those who are looking
*  for reasons to dislike the other camp, but no I don't think there's any significant theological
*  difference there and the Slavic tradition as I say is highly contrapuntal. You know
*  Rachmaninoff's church music. Sure. Yeah, okay.
*  How does the Orthodox Church in America avoid simply becoming an American religion, one of
*  many others? So far it seems to be failing to do that. What's the reason for that failure? Why
*  isn't it strong enough? For any number of reasons. One, there's been a huge influx of
*  former evangelicals into American Orthodoxy, but the problem is Orthodoxy doesn't have,
*  most of the Communions, unlike the Catholic Church, doesn't have a protocol for receiving
*  converts that's very clear. I mean they just, so you come to the liturgy, you ask questions,
*  and after a year or so you're chrismated or something. And the result is that many who come
*  into the church come with presuppositions formed in very radically different tradition. I mean,
*  fundamentalist evangelicalism is a much narrower understanding of how much speculation is possible.
*  They're not really prepared to look at a 2,000 year history and see all the varieties. You know,
*  this is the patristic period, here's the scholastic, and the Russian religious philosophers of the 19th
*  century were very different. And you know, be able to recognize that a huge variety of views is,
*  instead they tend to think in terms of a faith statement of the sort that an evangelical church
*  and to be honest, that's become such a dominant faction in so much American Orthodoxy that much
*  of American Orthodoxy is intellectually and temperamentally and socially and culturally just
*  American evangelicalism plus saints and incense. And so I would say that I don't think, you know,
*  the only way in which the Orthodox communities have successfully resisted this is also the
*  degrees to which many of them have remained rid-outs of ethnic identity. And that's not
*  much better. That too, you know, is... So I would say on the whole, the jury is still out. I think
*  Orthodoxy in America may very well just be another American religion at the end of the day,
*  another generation or two. And it won't be any... The only distinctions will be in liturgical form.
*  Peter Van Doren If one draws a line down the middle of Europe with Orthodoxy to the right
*  of that line, those nations seem to be much less democratic or democratic for shorter periods of
*  time. Is there something causal going on there? Or is that just historical accident?
*  David Sinclair Yeah, I wouldn't... Well, I mean, I don't know if Orthodoxy is such as the issue,
*  but I mean, the history of those nations were radically different in any number of ways. Some
*  of them, in the case, say, of most of the Slavic nations, have simply retained habits of governance
*  and habits of social organization that go back to a very pre-democratic past. I don't know if
*  there's any causal relationship between the kind of Christianity, because, of course,
*  Western democratic institutions tended to go hand in hand with some degree of laicization,
*  some degree of secularization. I mean, for the... I mean, the whole point of the French Revolution
*  would be the overthrow of the Ancien Régime, which is both state and church, you know,
*  you're dealing with a kind of absolutist, Gallican church, in a sense, that's a wing of government.
*  So my suspicion is this is mostly historical accident, the cultural tendencies towards
*  reaction in the East, or mostly it just has to do with the material conditions and the political
*  histories and the relative material isolation from the huge period of Western European expansion,
*  expansion of wealth, expansion of power, and ferment of social change and new ideas.
*  It was simply the case that after the Middle Ages, early modernity, Western Europe was the center
*  of economic and political power in the Western world.
*  Dr. Mark S. Levenson
*  Say Poland, Slovenia, Czechia, which have a lot of Catholicism in their backgrounds,
*  they seem to be converging on Western norms, living standards, much more than, say, the EU
*  members to the East, Bulgaria, Romania. Dr. Michael S. Levenson
*  Well, they have certain advantages to begin with, too, but yeah, I mean, better relations. Again,
*  I don't think it has any particular... To be honest, I mean, Polish Catholicism is basically
*  culturally very much like Slavic orthodoxy. I mean, there you're going to find that culturally,
*  Catholicism and orthodoxy are closer to one another in many ways than Catholicism in the
*  East is with Catholicism in the West. So it's trying to draw causal ties between
*  what are very complex social histories, I just think is a mistake. There's no way of saying one
*  way or the other. I mean, Greek democracy flourished in the modern age for a while.
*  I mean, after the revolution, after Greek independence in the early 19th century,
*  and Greece remains orthodox, too, and it's even more than Poland is committed to a kind of
*  set of real democratic norms. In Poland, there are stronger reactionary forces at present than
*  there are in Greece. What do you think of the Book of Mormon? And what is it about the Bible
*  that so lent itself to this new spin-off or startup? The Book of Mormon? I have no opinions
*  about it whatsoever. It's kind of silly, you know, that's the way it comes across to me, but
*  you know, I've only read it once. I think that if you say the Bible lends itself to spin-offs,
*  I mean, any religion that has tendencies towards the collapse of the difference in
*  significance between history and eternity is always likely to inspire new historical projects
*  that consider themselves. I mean, after all, this is something of the Abrahamic religions,
*  is that they're sort of supersessionist in the way they proceed. I mean, even within the history of
*  Judaism before Christianity, it's one covenant superseding another, then the Christians claim
*  that they've superseded the covenant in some sense, and then Islam is a supersession of the
*  revelation with yet another revelation. So this seems to be just part and parcel of the whole
*  Western Abrahamic or the whole Abrahamic religious tradition. So I suppose I would say that Mormonism
*  is just another example of that kind of new revelation, the claim of a new revelation.
*  There's a general question I have about the roles of reason and faith in theological argument. So
*  when I hear members of the Orthodox Church criticize, say, the papacy and ex cathedra
*  doctrine, what they say makes perfect sense to me. They deploy reason, they have arguments of reason
*  against the doctrine, but in other contexts, religions, including orthodoxy, they're quite
*  willing to invoke faith. And so we have faith in whatever. So is it reason or is it faith that
*  determines when an argument from reason or an argument from faith is appropriate?
*  Reason.
*  Reason. So reason's the bottom line.
*  It has to be, because even if you choose faith, you're choosing to believe something for reasons.
*  Even if you're not able to name those reasons to yourself, some sort of compelling rational
*  intuition has worked upon you to say, well, I believe I can trust this source more than that
*  source. So you may say that, oh, I'm having faith in what it's telling me, but you're having faith
*  in that rather than something else, because at some level, maybe a tacit level, that you'd have a hard
*  time laying out, you've somehow reached the judgment. And then it would have to be a rational
*  judgment if your faith is of any meaning, that you trust this rather than that.
*  So I would say that, but what is faith? I mean, when you create a sort of division between faith
*  and reason, you're assuming that faith is taking things simply on the authority of another
*  blindly. But that's never actually been the definition that any religion, whether you're
*  talking in the West or when you talk about pisteis in Greek or shradda in Sanskrit or any number of
*  other words for faith, it usually means a kind of rational commitment to a certain path for which
*  you have reasons, but that those reasons in themselves don't necessarily arrive at a QED,
*  but that as you advance on this path, more you're hoping, at least things become clearer and clearer,
*  and you understand better whether you really believe it or not. But you have to commit yourself
*  to the path in order to find a way. The American philosopher William James spoke of the will to
*  believe, and he's often misunderstood if all he was saying was, it's okay to choose arbitrarily
*  to believe something. That's not what he said. What he said was, it's as if you're in the fog,
*  say, and you encounter two paths, and you have a sense that one is more likely to lead to safety
*  and the other to the edge of a cliff. You take that path, but you don't take it so credulously
*  that you'll walk off the edge of a cliff if you come to the cliff, that the act of faith is a way
*  of engaging the mind, engaging reason so it can explore. If you don't start with some sort of trust,
*  some sort of possibility of discovering the truth, then you never will seek the truth to begin with.
*  But that search requires a kind of combination of a degree of rational judgment and a degree of trust,
*  and you hope that the two prove to be in harmony. If they're not, though, if you reach a point
*  where your faith and your reason come into conflict, then trust your reason.
*  Always trust your reason, because otherwise, faith is just epistemic nihilism. Sorry,
*  pronouncing the word both ways today is just meaningless. It's just a brute exertion of the
*  will, at which point it's subrational and becomes contemptible. Always trust reason, but make sure
*  that reason is tempered. It's not petty rationalism, but it's a reason that really can see things in
*  broad perspective and understand in a variety of modalities. Don't treat reason as if it's a math
*  equation. So given that perspective, does it ever make sense to think about the deity in probabilistic
*  or Bayesian terms? Because it's sounding almost Bayesian to me. Well, the chance that God exists
*  is 73%. Well, you're actually God. Faith is the question of existence of God. I mean, that's not
*  what I was talking about when I talked about faith. I meant a path towards the sacred. There,
*  first of all, it's to define what the word existence means, because God would not exist
*  in the way that an individual entity, a finite entity exists. So any rational arguments you have
*  about God are based on usually a kind of modal metaphysics of the absolute and the contingent,
*  or so on and so forth. And there, I think reason should be fully engaged.
*  The question is, within a tradition, that's when things become a bit more stochastic.
*  It's like, is this... I can start, if I don't start from the premise that
*  when I speak of God, that is that there's an absolute source and end to all things,
*  then I'm not really interested in the question of religion at all. But if I believe that may be true,
*  if I have a sense of it, or if reason tells me it's so, that it doesn't make sense to believe
*  in a pure physicalism or materialism, then where faith is engaged is in trying to make
*  rational judgments about who can point you towards a deeper understanding and relationship.
*  I don't think that's Bayesian so much as... It's not a leap of faith in the vulgar sense,
*  but it is a venture of faith in the sense that you can't start with perfect wisdom and knowledge.
*  You are making rational judgments. And again, rationality is not a single, univocal sort of
*  thing. It can also have to do with intuitions, like moral intuitions. If you come up against
*  a doctrine or a teaching or something that is repugnant to your moral reasoning, then that is
*  significant. And it would be deplorable of you to choose to believe it despite the councils of
*  your moral reasoning, unless you had really good reasons to think you'd been mistaken.
*  Does the concept of reincarnation make theological sense to you?
*  Sure. Within the systems in which you're talking about. Punebaba in Buddhism isn't about the
*  reincarnation of a psychological ego. It has to do with an uncontrollable set of karmic
*  consequences that lead to new phenomena arising. So there you're dealing with one notion.
*  The versions that you find in Vedanta and Bhakti and other things that we call Hinduism,
*  or also in Sikhism or Jainism, in which the Jiva, something that is a kind of soul passes over,
*  even that's not a psychological self, but nonetheless that's a more substantial sense
*  of the meaning of reincarnation. Within those systems, yeah, they make perfect sense.
*  But again, people tend to think they know what these terms mean. When you actually look at the
*  traditions, they have to be qualified and modified and explained at length because you
*  can't step out of an entire world of presuppositions and beliefs and concepts and just take one thing
*  like that, Punebaba, again becoming, I'm just choosing to use the Buddhist term,
*  and think you understand what's going on, as if you could just transpose it into saying,
*  oh, I'm a Presbyterian and I know what this means because you can't do that.
*  What do you think of the testimonies of what are called near-death experiences,
*  many of those testimonies coming from Christians, of course?
*  Well, I mean, I don't know. Some of them, I think, are quite compelling, especially the ones
*  that involve being able to reconstruct
*  facts surrounding the moment of your death that you shouldn't have been able to know,
*  like who was out in the hallway, things like that. You can't completely deny that. But at the same
*  time, I think also that you're dealing with a moment of transition in which it's very hard
*  to separate the psychological from the objective. So I wouldn't dismiss them. Many of them,
*  as I say, are quite compelling. But how much you can learn from them?
*  It seems like a lot more testimony than, say, from the apostles or in the four gospels,
*  that if we weigh testimony, one is led in many different directions,
*  including, of course, the Book of Mormon.
*  Well, I mean, who's testimony? Come on. I mean, the Book of Mormon is supposedly
*  read off from these golden plates that Joseph Smith was shown, able to read with magical
*  spectacles, plates that no one else ever saw. That's very much a kind of story. If you want
*  to believe it, you can. But that's not... And maybe you can say the same about everyone's testimony.
*  The judgments you have to make at times, just no one's testimony should be taken as an absolute
*  authority. No one's. Because no one is free from psychological limitations. So even if he or she is
*  perfectly sincere, that in itself doesn't prove anything. But you can make judgments on character.
*  You can make judgments about coherence. These are, again, are relative judgments. They're not absolute.
*  I think that when the story becomes... I don't know why you keep bringing up Mormonism. I mean,
*  I have absolutely no connections. I've never written about it. My only connection... I've
*  met a few nice Mormons. I've read the Book of Mormon once. I didn't find it particularly well
*  written, but neither for that matter as most of the New Testament. And I think it's based on
*  historical claims that are objectively false. So that there are these ancient civilizations in
*  the Americas that just didn't exist. But I think the story of the genesis of the Book of Mormon
*  is a bit more incredible than, say, somebody in the first century writing down what his theology
*  is based on. As is the case of Paul, obviously a person whose life was turned upside down by
*  some kind of experience. Maybe he was a psychotic. I don't know. But it doesn't seem that way when
*  you read it, that there is some powerful spiritual apprehension that he has discovered about the love
*  of God and the grace of God. And that over many decades of self-sacrificing life leading ultimately
*  to his death, he lays that out. Well, that's compelling to me in a way that other sorts of
*  claims that seem more incredible aren't. In the United States, has progressive politics become
*  the new version of a secular Christianity? Well, I don't know. I mean, in some cases, yeah. In some
*  cases, not. I mean, it depends on what you're talking about in particular. I think that
*  we have learned both in America, but also in the West as such, just to a pathological degree in
*  America, on both right and left, we've learned to start all of our conversations from a position
*  of moral absolutism. I don't know if this has always been the case. I mean, there have been
*  apocalyptic moments in American history before. I mean, we had a civil war, for instance.
*  But at the present, it seems like both extremes speak in such strident tones of moral indignation
*  that it is tempting to think that they're speaking out of a dogmatic impulse rather
*  than a rational one, that there is a kind of religious intonation in the worst sense
*  in our politics on all sides. Is the future of Christianity as an institution brighter or darker
*  than it was, say, 20 years ago? 20 years? Well, 20, I mean. 30 years ago. How about 100 years ago?
*  I mean, you've got to, I don't know. I mean, what would be brighter or darker? I mean, for me,
*  you know, what would be good? What would be bad? There are people I know, in fact, people
*  near here in Notre Dame, who are all terrifically intent on trying to revive a dying Christendom,
*  because they think that would be the revival of Christianity in the West. And they allied
*  themselves to these reactionary figures like Viktor Orban, whereas I, my ideal of what would
*  be a brighter future for Christianity would be the final eclipse of that kind of conflation of
*  Christianity with the interests of a particular civilization or culture or nation. I believe
*  that's a perfidious corruption. So bright in what way? You know, I would say that in many ways,
*  the brightest future for Christianity might consist in the death of many of its institutions
*  and of much of its cultural power. The TV show The Prisoner, how should it have ended?
*  Ah, now that's an interesting question. The last episode, I will admit, is a bit of a disappointment,
*  but I think it ended properly. I mean, I think Patrick McGuinn made his point that
*  number one is the self, that we imprison ourselves before anyone else can imprison us. So I think
*  the last episode would have been better had it been written as well as the one just before it.
*  But you know, you can't have everything. I'm contented with the way it went out.
*  This seems like a minor and a silly question, but it is true. You know, they did a remake
*  for AMC of The Prisoner some years ago. And in the original, of course, number six,
*  he escapes. Now, his escape is an absolute because he goes back home and it turns out still to be,
*  in some sense, the village. He is still the prisoner of himself, but he destroys the village,
*  right? Yes. In the new version, he saves the village and turns it into a kind of psychotherapeutic
*  spa that some people require in place of the reality of this world. I found that a sublimely
*  nihilistic conclusion. So let me put it in there. The way it should have ended is the way it
*  originally ended, not the way the remake ended it. Maybe that's a kind of woke ending reflecting
*  moral depravity, that moral judgments are not complex and the self is unitary and everything
*  is easy and you just have to pick the right side and you can set everything right again.
*  Well, what would be the right side? I don't think we know, but I think in the AMC remake,
*  the implication is that it's easy to pick the right side.
*  I just got the impression that it shows the therapeutic over the Gnostic. That is,
*  that in the original program, it was consciously at times a Gnostic allegory. In fact, there was
*  one episode called The Dance of the Dead that just explicitly sort of invokes a Gnostic language
*  of somehow we're imprisoned in a false reality and that we should long for the really real
*  at whatever cost and should seek to escape from delusion. Whereas the new version simply says that
*  in a sense of maybe there is no truth at all, there is no right side or wrong side. There's just the
*  need for therapy to help us deal with the sense of alienation or discontent.
*  And that of those two options, I prefer the former.
*  Maybe at times Gnosticism is too pessimistic for Hollywood TV
*  and too inegalitarian for modern progressivism.
*  So you have to jettison it and what do you replace it with?
*  I don't know.
*  Happy ending.
*  Well, I mean, I'm not quite sure what your politics are. So I have no concern one way or the other
*  about how it's viewed in regard to progressivism. I mean, I'm a socialist. So I mean, I'm
*  perfectly fine. I'm not a liberal, but I'm definitely a socialist.
*  And so, you know, my concern about it and yeah, Gnosticism is classical statements to the degree
*  there was such a thing. I want to point out that in scholarly terms, who knows,
*  there's so many different schools that we've simply stuck together and called Gnostic that
*  when you actually look at them, the details, much of what we call Gnosticism is just actually
*  Pauline or Johannine Christianity in the New Testament, restated with an overlay of
*  fabulism. But I think to be honest, there's been kind of a vogue of Gnosticism in popular culture,
*  not where you'd expect it, but like, you know, there've been lots of films.
*  Rick Allen Movie versus TV,
*  though. It's a big difference. Matrix, right?
*  The Matrix things, yeah, which were the, you know, not, not, not, not,
*  my mind, not very good films, but the Truman Show, which is just a pure Gnostic allegory,
*  Gattaca done by the same fellow. And television too. I mean, as far as I know, I don't,
*  if you said I'm large enough to know, but I did a few years ago, what was the battle star Galactica,
*  the sci-fi version. I actually got hooked on that and watched it through. And there are plenty of
*  Gnostic themes in that. So they ruin the ending in the final season, right? It's like the remake
*  of the prisoner. I disagree there. Actually, I kind of liked the, the angels turning out to be real
*  angels and the, um, you know, but, but then again, it's been so long since I saw it. I'm not sure.
*  Maybe I'm misremembering how it ended. For me, the best parts were seasons one and two,
*  where it stays a bit dark and nasty and problematic.
*  Well, I'd have to go back and revisit it. I have to admit my memory is not that sharp.
*  Which is the best Bob Dylan song?
*  Blind Willie McTel.
*  I might say Mr. Tambourine Man or Highway 61.
*  Well, it all depends on which, which era you're in. Of course, there's the stuff we grew up with.
*  And so I would have said Mr. Tambourine Man up until, and then, then, uh, Blind Willie McTel is,
*  is sort of his revival period, you know, in Fidels Onward. Uh, and then I like a lot of the stuff in
*  Oh Mercy. They're the man in the, is it the man in the black coat? So I'm afraid he's been around
*  too long. You, you really have to say, uh, what's the best vintage Dylan? What's the best middle
*  period Dylan? What's the best revival middle period Dylan? What's the best late period, you know,
*  but if I had to choose one to be played, uh, while my corpse is being marched in its coffin
*  down Bourbon Street or something, I would go with Blind Willie McTel.
*  Why be so taken with the nation of Bhutan? There was a recent UN survey, a survey of happiness.
*  Bhutan comes in 97. There's another recent paper ranking nations for negative affect, you know,
*  how much stress and hardship is in your life. Bhutan comes in 149, which is not well at all.
*  One time you wrote quote, Bhutan conforms better than any other state to my criteria
*  for national greatness. Why not just reject Bhutan? It's a failed state.
*  Well, first of all, uh, that's a satirical piece that was written so long ago that I'm
*  surprised that anyone remembers it. Uh, my, the joke being, uh, that, that, uh, it was a period
*  when people were talking about American greatness as well before Trump and everything. I mean,
*  this was something else and, and it was always being couched in terms of economic development
*  from world power and all that. So I chose the most isolated, most sort of militantly rural,
*  um, the most unworldly. Now, after doing that, of course, I had to say, well, then again,
*  when I looked at it again, like the treatment of Nepalese refugees and Bhutan was anything but
*  admirable and all that. But at the time I was making a joke about what constitutes national
*  greatness. And so the notion that, that you have a country that, that, you know, didn't have any
*  television in it, uh, up until like a decade ago and only needed one stoplight. And then they,
*  in the whole country, and then they removed it because it offended their aesthetic sense.
*  It just seemed like a funny column at the time, but if you mean it by really willing to go to the
*  mat defending Bhutan against, uh, you know, all its critics, no, no, that was a, that was a satire.
*  What do you think of Sarah Rudin's translation of the New Testament?
*  I think it's awful.
*  Why?
*  It's just very bad. I just think it's, it's barely literate. I think it's very inaccurate. I say
*  this not as someone, I think she's done other translations that are quite wonderful. I think
*  her translation of Augustine is the best in modern English, but I think, um, her insistence on, on
*  translating philologically in the sense of, you know, taking the meaning of words from their roots,
*  and doing other things of that sort all the way through was horribly ill-advised. And I think
*  she also just doesn't know the period very well. She's a classicist in one sense, but late antiquity
*  and certainly second temple Judaism and late antique Christianity are just not in her wheelhouse,
*  and there are just so many, um, things that she gets wrong. And I just think it reads
*  exceedingly badly. I don't know what, what, what she, I agree with Luke Timothy Johnson,
*  who with all the goodwill in the world just described it as a mess.
*  What do you think goes wrong when that book is translated by committees?
*  The lowest common denominator wins out, and that usually means the, the tacitly approved theology
*  of the most unimaginative and historically uninformed faction in the committee. And there's
*  a concern not to offend against people's piety, even, even when the text itself. So you get
*  translations that are not warranted by the Greek and they're not warranted by the history of the
*  time in which the text appeared, but nonetheless are chosen because they don't offend against
*  people's theological expectations. And that's simply, I think, true of every commi- now, you
*  see the King James is an exception only because it's based on the Tyndale translation. It wasn't
*  really a committee project. The committee simply dotted the I's, crossed the T's, fixed a few
*  things, did some good. And, and, but, but that was first and foremost, the work of an individual
*  genius. Even then the King James should not be used for theology. It should, it's great literature,
*  it's great liturgy. It's better than many later translates, far more accurate say than, than a
*  piece of rubbish like the New International version. But it's still, a lot of its translation is based
*  on later Christian doctrine rather than on what the Greek actually says.
*  Pete What's the most important thing you learned about the New Testament by translating it?
*  John We're fools if we think we understand it, but I think even though I knew this,
*  more than ever I came to appreciate the sheer diversity even in the first generation of
*  Christians. I mean, this is not a unified text. It doesn't reflect a unified theology. What it
*  reflects is many different reactions to an event of extraordinary mystery and power for those who
*  are writing about it. At least especially when you're dealing say with the Pauline literature,
*  which is very early in the Gospels too are drawn from earlier strata of Christian literature. I
*  mean, some of the later stuff like Second Peter, there you're already well into a period of
*  hardening factions. But I think the thing that I came away with is that every attempt to ground
*  absolute doctrine, fixity of dogma in the text is an absurd project because it's simply not there.
*  It does not, it is not that kind of book. It is not an index of propositional content.
*  John What was the most difficult word of importance to translate?
*  John Well,
*  that's a question. All Thales, God with the article as opposed to Thales, but that's not the only one.
*  They see there's a cluster of words here, Pneuma, the spirit, in the sense that there you're dealing
*  with a word that in different contexts can just mean life or breath or the spirit or the spirit
*  of God or the spirit in you. And sometimes is used to mean all those things at once,
*  because the very concept of spirit and later antiquity, especially when there was an influence
*  of say stoic metaphysics was of a kind of element that on the one hand was intellectual,
*  on another was physical, it was like the wind really can be called Pneuma without it necessarily
*  meaning something drastically different from spirit when we're speaking of intelligence or mind.
*  And also because when you actually get to the way it's used in the New Testament mysteriously,
*  say by Paul, it's not clear that he makes the distinction that later tradition makes. In fact,
*  he doesn't. He clearly doesn't. That is the divine spirit and human spirit are absolutely
*  separate realities. They're not. In Paul, they often are one in the same or only slightly
*  differentiated or differentiated within a prior unity. And you see this picked up in very early
*  theology, like someone like Irenaeus for whom the human spirit is just the divine spirit.
*  There's no difference really to speak of between human and divine spirit.
*  And then the way later translations dealt with this was again and again to make decisions that
*  here spirit means the Holy Spirit, which we understand as in later Nicene terms as one of
*  the co-equal persons of the Trinity. Here spirit means human spirit. And so the translations
*  capitalize and add holy to it. And when you go back to the Greek, it's simply not there. It's
*  not talking in that clear and precise way with all those distinctions in place. It's a much more
*  mysterious word and it's very difficult to put it in context from verse to verse to verse.
*  And in some places, you know that the plural meanings are intended. I had to use footnotes.
*  Who's your favorite post-war European composer broadly in the classical tradition?
*  Post-war?
*  The music that everyone else hates.
*  Oh, the 20th. Well, that's very unfair because the late 20th century, the second half of the
*  20th century was a period of no particular style. So there are composers who are neoclassical or
*  neoromantic as well as the cutting edge and avant-garde. I don't have a single favorite.
*  I love Stravinsky. I love Ray Vaughan Williams.
*  I think it's a wonderful period for music.
*  I think it is too. It was a period of extraordinary riches. I love
*  Takamitsu Turo. I think the wonderful thing about the 20th century was it was the age of global
*  music. It was an age in which composers were allowed to draw on the past and at the same time
*  working in new idioms. Benjamin Britten would write neoclassically. He would even write some
*  serial pieces, a 12-tone row. He would write atonally. It all sounds like Benjamin Britten.
*  It's all wonderful. Or then he would draw for the Prince of the Pagodas. He would draw on
*  Javanese gamelan. I love that. I love the music, the great composers of the 20th century. There
*  was some rubbish. I mean, you couldn't pay me to listen to Storchhausen. And there are all these
*  wonderful composers that get overlooked because of the decline of the cultural centrality. So
*  figures like Nikos Skalkotos and others in Greece or Weinberg in Russia, Hensa in Germany. No,
*  I don't have a single favorite composer. Messiaen would be one. I love him a lot.
*  Sure. And for more recent church music, what would you look to?
*  More recent church music?
*  So the last 50 years.
*  Dave Brubeck.
*  Good. Which is your favorite recording of the Beethoven symphonies?
*  Dave Brubeck. I see I don't have a single one. I think the second Deutsche Gramophone
*  series with Carrion for modern instruments for-
*  Steve McLaughlin The 78 series, not the 63.
*  Dave Brubeck Right. Very good. Okay. For original instruments,
*  if the recording were better, I like, actually believe it or not, the Roy Goodman performances.
*  They're just too many. I mean, there you're dealing with a repertoire that's been recorded
*  so many times that the virtues of different recordings, we have to choose something a bit
*  more recherche. But everything after they got over the ponderous overly romantic style of Toscanini
*  and Fort Fangler and all that got back to Carrion made it more genuinely classical.
*  And then the new the original instruments approach where they actually use,
*  who is I'm trying to think how the British conductor who did those wonderful recordings-
*  Roger Norrington.
*  Thank you. Thank you. Using the actual metronome markings of Beethoven. Absolute revelation. You
*  know, hearing the music, realizing that it has all of the grandeur and fire and power of Beethoven
*  but also has the lightness of Mozart, you know, the quickness, the agility, you know.
*  So there are a lot of great recordings of Beethoven. But I am really glad we got over
*  the almost Wagnerian approach to Beethoven that was in place well up through the 1950s.
*  The final segment of our conversation, the David Bentley Hart production function.
*  How did you learn all those languages, you know?
*  I just, I don't know, just studied them. I don't know. See, the thing is, I know better
*  linguists than myself in the sense that I know people who can learn to speak a language in like
*  a few months and speak it as if they were native. I'm, because of the way my brain is constructed,
*  I have to learn the grammar first, do it, you know, I learn the syntax, I much, and then
*  learn it on paper and then learn to speak it. I mean, except for like the things I got early
*  in school. I mean, you go to French class and Spanish class, you speak it before you really
*  immerse yourself in the grammar. But my approach to most languages is like the approach I had to
*  Latin and Greek as a kid. I learned the grammar. So I think that whatever the case,
*  I have a talent for languages, but I don't have, I still envy those who can just somehow absorb it
*  without having to master the grammar first and then speak it like a native. I've known,
*  I knew a fellow like that at Cambridge who now still alive has like 32 languages under his belt.
*  Which languages do you know?
*  Well, quite a few.
*  We have time, you can tell us.
*  Well, you know, with varying degrees of competency, Western and Eastern, my side is
*  English, but of course, French, German, Spanish, Italian, not bad at Portuguese.
*  Let's see, I mean, I'm lousy, but competent in Russian. I had to study Hebrew Syriac.
*  In theology, I had Greek and Latin from early on. I studied and I don't consider myself
*  a master of, but I can read now among Asian languages, Sanskrit, Pali,
*  classical Chinese, although I find it so nomic at times, it's hard to
*  be sure that you get the meaning right. It's amazing how many really variant readings you
*  can get at the same Chinese poem by Li Bai, the same line, it comes out completely differently.
*  I'm still working at my Japanese. I know some Britonic Celtic languages, kind of.
*  I don't know if I'm forgetting anything or not. When I was an undergraduate, I thought I might
*  be doing Native American studies. I worked on spoken Cheyenne, tzitzitza, to be precise,
*  but that's pretty rusty. How do you construct your media diet? What do you consume?
*  You wake up, you want inflow, what do you do? Books. I mean, I'm still pretty much living in
*  a different century in that regard. I do watch, I mean, I will pretend I don't watch television
*  ever. I do. I was fairly hooked on Better Call Saul, for instance, and Breaking Bad before that.
*  But it's mostly books. I don't have a lot of subscriptions to magazines. I don't like
*  social media at all. I don't like the internet, even though I have a Substack newsletter.
*  But I see that as just a subscription magazine, digital form rather than print.
*  Just for our listeners, how can they subscribe to you? What's the name of your Substack?
*  Oh, it's called Leaves in the Wind.
*  How would you summarize it in a sentence?
*  Well, all the things I write about, I write about there. It's not about one thing in particular
*  over the years. I've built up a readership that's literary criticism, philosophy, theology, fiction.
*  You didn't mention that at the beginning. I've also published five or six volumes of fiction,
*  so that sometimes short stories show up on it. And this year I've been recording conversations
*  with other writers. So it's for people who just like to read without necessarily knowing what
*  the topic's going to be in the next post. What's the outstanding theological problem
*  that you think about the most? Relations with other faiths. I think that we need
*  radically to rethink the very category of religion that we've inherited in the modern age.
*  The sort of anthropological notion that these are systems of propositions opposed to one another
*  rather than as the ancient view would be. Religion was a virtue that all human beings
*  practiced in greater or lesser degree with greater or lesser understanding.
*  But for instance, I don't write much theology anymore. But when I do, I draw, even if it's
*  Christian theology, I'm quite happy to draw in Vedantic sources from India if they illuminate
*  a question for me. And I think we do have to rethink what exactly it is we're talking about
*  when we talk about religion. The other thing, I guess, because I published that book a couple
*  years ago, that all shall be saved, is Christians radically need to rethink and go back to the
*  original text and go back to the first century and rethink this grotesque notion of an eternal hell.
*  Pete Slauson
*  Yes, you have a whole book on that, which I like very much.
*  Final question, what will you do next?
*  John Sussman
*  Well, what I'll do now, I have several projects going on at any given time. I've got some,
*  I've got a volume of short stories coming out at some point. I've got to finish a
*  second, a sequel to a children's book I wrote with my son. We're writing the sequels on the
*  son. I have a book on philosophy of mind that's almost finished, it's coming out from Yale.
*  So, I'm never just doing one thing at a time because I'm too jittery. If I concentrate on
*  just one task at a time, I get depressed.
*  Pete Slauson David Bentleyhart, thank you very much.
*  John Sussman Well, thank you for having me.
