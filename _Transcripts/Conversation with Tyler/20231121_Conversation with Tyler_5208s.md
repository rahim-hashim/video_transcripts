Video Description: This bonus episode features audio from the  Holberg Debate (https://www.uib.no/en/udir/131536/2019-holberg-debate-slavoj-%C5%BEi%C5%BEek-%C2%ABwhy-i-am-still-communist%C2%BB) in Bergen, Norway between Tyler and Slavoj Žižek held on December 7, 2019. They discuss the reasons Slavoj (still) considers himself a Communist, why he calls The Handmaid’s Tale “nostalgia for the present,” what he likes about Greta Thunberg, what Marx got right about the commodification of beliefs, his concerns about ecology and surveillance in communist states like China today, the reasons academia should maintain its ‘useless character,’ his beginnings as a Heideggerian, why he is distrustful of liberal optimism, the “Fukuyama dilemma” we face, the importance of “empty manners,” and more.

# Slavoj Žižek on His Stubborn Attachment to Communism | Conversations with Tyler

*  Before you begin, let me express my admiration for him. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=30.0s)]
*  I am a strange communist like Marx, who said that one can learn more from a conservative [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  like Balzac than from all progressives about economy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=46.4s)]
*  I think that our only true partners, the true leftists today, are modest, intelligent, honest, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=50.96s)]
*  skeptics, conservatives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=58.76s)]
*  This morning he provided the best, I'm grateful for it, the best definition of myself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  He told me that he considers me a moderate conservative communist. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=66.2s)]
*  My gratitude to you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=71.28s)]
*  I would like to pursue this theme. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=74.6s)]
*  Thank you for your remarks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=76.62s)]
*  The assigned topic was why I am still a communist. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=78.56s)]
*  I think in fact what you argued was why I am no longer a communist. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=81.68s)]
*  And you can be thought of as favoring a kind of social democracy with more effort directed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=87.56s)]
*  at climate change. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=92.56s)]
*  But before we get to psychoanalyzing you, let me start with a simple factual question. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=93.56s)]
*  So you cite China as the biggest success story of communism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=98.88s)]
*  But is it so successful? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=102.84s)]
*  It has right now the per capita income pretty much exactly equal to Mexico. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=103.84s)]
*  Not so impressive. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  If you look at capitalist Taiwan, it has the per capita income of France, single payer, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=109.68s)]
*  health insurance, gay marriage. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  It's a complete liberal democracy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=116.72s)]
*  Life there is very nice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  Furthermore, the last 30 years, the air in Taiwan has become much cleaner and the air [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=120.16s)]
*  in China has become much dirtier. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  So why isn't China the failure, Taiwan the success? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=126.76s)]
*  And yes, it's a vote for capitalism, not communism. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=129.72s)]
*  You're already asking me a question. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=132.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=134.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=135.36s)]
*  It's a real question. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=136.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=137.36s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=138.36s)]
*  What China 50 years ago, the difference is still absolutely shocking. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=140.36s)]
*  Look at Shanghai, Beijing today and so on. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=146.96s)]
*  Second point, you know, forget about per capita, compare prices and so on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  And you will see that today's China, that today's China, the standard of living of middle [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  classes, at least in the developed part, you know, numbers at this level don't tell [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=163.6s)]
*  a lot. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=169.2s)]
*  But at one point, I agree with you that this in the long term, this, whatever we call it, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=170.2s)]
*  Chinese authoritarian capitalism or whatever we call it will not work. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=177.44s)]
*  I think. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=182.56s)]
*  And China has put over a million people in concentration camps. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=183.56s)]
*  Their labor force is already shrinking. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=186.84s)]
*  Rate of growth is falling. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=188.92s)]
*  So you are in fact a moderate right pro Taiwan communist. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=190.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=195.0s)]
*  No, but okay. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=196.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=197.0s)]
*  Can I briefly answer you very honestly? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=198.0s)]
*  I see all your points. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=200.24s)]
*  I agree with them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=202.32s)]
*  But my point is this one nonetheless. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=204.68s)]
*  And now I want to ask you, if I may, a question. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=206.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=209.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=210.52s)]
*  I know we exaggerate and I'm well aware of, I emphasize the, do you remember how easy is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=211.52s)]
*  to fall into this fascination by catastrophic prospect? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=218.32s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  No, you are not old enough. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  I am. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=224.28s)]
*  Some of you must around 30, 40 years ago, most of Europe, especially Germany, I remember [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=225.28s)]
*  very well, was obsessed by Valks Terben. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=231.84s)]
*  I live in Germany. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=234.84s)]
*  And I remember the cover of Spiegel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=235.84s)]
*  They demonstrated exactly with statistics that 40, 50 years after that time today, Europe [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=238.64s)]
*  will be without forests. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=245.68s)]
*  I'm sad to tell you, but according to some statistics today, there are more forests in [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=247.68s)]
*  the world than at any point in last hundred years. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=253.4s)]
*  So I'm over aware of this fascination of catastrophe, but nonetheless, I think, and you can deny [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=256.92s)]
*  it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  I will not, when we communist take over, you will go to Gulag, but for different reasons. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  Where will you go? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=272.12s)]
*  Why I'm glad to talk with him. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=274.56s)]
*  That, you know, in today's politically correct climate, in typical Western academic institution, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=276.56s)]
*  you cannot talk like that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=284.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=285.6s)]
*  No, but seriously. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=286.6s)]
*  But I nonetheless see these threats and I could go on indefinitely, like digital control [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=287.6s)]
*  and so on. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=294.0s)]
*  Things are serious there. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=295.0s)]
*  The extent to which we are manipulated already and so on. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=296.4s)]
*  Ecology, immigration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=300.12s)]
*  And did you notice I'm not a simple humanitarian there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=302.28s)]
*  I just don't share this simple optimism, open on hearts and what? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=306.4s)]
*  All the poor will move to Europe and whatever. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=312.76s)]
*  So how, very simple question, I will try to cut myself short. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=315.56s)]
*  How these three domains that I outlined, I think at least in the long term, they need [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=319.24s)]
*  a more radical. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=325.68s)]
*  Something will have to happen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=328.32s)]
*  Do you, probably you don't agree. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=329.76s)]
*  Do you see them as serious threats? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=332.04s)]
*  Are you still a Fukuyamaist in the sense of we just make a system function a little bit [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=334.44s)]
*  better? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=339.6s)]
*  I'm skeptical there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=340.6s)]
*  The threats you mentioned, I all see as serious. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=341.8s)]
*  But ecology, keep in mind the communist nations where the worst polluters still are. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=344.44s)]
*  Surveillance, the worst culprits. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  China, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=352.48s)]
*  Not a fully communist nation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=353.88s)]
*  But nonetheless, surveillance is worst in China. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=355.68s)]
*  If you're worried about genetic engineering and the reshaping of mankind, biggest offender [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=358.88s)]
*  is likely to be China. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=363.96s)]
*  I even know, it may surprise you, the exact data. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=366.08s)]
*  I was shown by a friend in Sabrap of Shanghai, already clinics. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=370.4s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=374.96s)]
*  Okay, sorry, I will not lose too much time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=375.96s)]
*  This will interest you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=378.2s)]
*  I met years ago in Frankfurt Book Fair, one high guy from Chinese Academy of Sciences. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=379.2s)]
*  He gave me printed in English the short program, programmatic note. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=386.2s)]
*  And it says, it shocked me, literally, the goal of biogenetic in China is to regulate [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=391.12s)]
*  physical and psychic health of the Chinese nation. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=398.36s)]
*  They are directly doing it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=403.28s)]
*  What I only don't like is don't just evoke China as this ultimate horror. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=404.96s)]
*  We are basically doing the same, I claim. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=411.64s)]
*  Let me now get to my theory of you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=414.96s)]
*  Now there's an old interview I read with you and I found this passage quite striking, quote, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=417.56s)]
*  and sympathetic, I should add. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  The movies I watch are often old Stalinist movies. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=424.52s)]
*  The songs that I listen to are old communist songs, dot, dot, dot. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  I fully admit it, but it is also my pleasure. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=434.08s)]
*  Now also, you're from Slovenia, you're from the Balkans. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=437.96s)]
*  That part of the world has not developed ideally. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=441.52s)]
*  There are far-right parties in many places. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=444.8s)]
*  There's been war. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=447.44s)]
*  The Balkans are still a disappointment. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=448.44s)]
*  So there's a negative outlook on the world you're from. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=451.0s)]
*  And I view your attachment to the communist label as a kind of nostalgia, like the old [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=455.12s)]
*  Stalinist songs, which you don't actually think are better than Beethoven. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=460.32s)]
*  But it's somewhat like the old East German women who love their Sprevald pickles, the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=466.04s)]
*  old cars, the Trabis, and the communist label for you. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=471.52s)]
*  It's like your Sprevald pickles, the Gorki. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=474.96s)]
*  It's like the Trabi. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=478.04s)]
*  And why not just cast it aside and live free? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=479.56s)]
*  Why be so tied to your own nostalgia? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=483.36s)]
*  That's my question. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=485.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=486.46s)]
*  My counter question is then that obviously what I read today around are nonetheless, I'm [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=487.46s)]
*  more of a pessimist. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=492.56s)]
*  You see, we are coming back to this basic dilemma. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=493.56s)]
*  You need this nostalgia, right? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=497.38s)]
*  Why not free yourself by jettisoning the nostalgia and take the next step? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=499.36s)]
*  If I were your therapist, this is what I would be asking you to do. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=504.76s)]
*  Let's go on. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=510.0s)]
*  What I don't want to lose your time, but what really fascinates me in Stalinism is how, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=511.0s)]
*  if you look at it closely, how fascinated Stalinism was by America. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=519.28s)]
*  For example, do you know that that's why I like Soviet cinemas, that the absolute model [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=527.0s)]
*  of Soviet cinema was Hollywood. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=532.0s)]
*  They had desperate plans in the 30s to build on crime, their own version of Hollywood, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=535.2s)]
*  how they imitated Hollywood, and so on and so on. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=540.66s)]
*  I claim that even explicitly when Stalin was asked around 1930, his definition of a Bolshevik, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=543.68s)]
*  the one which combines Russian dedication to a sacred cause with American pragmatism, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=552.96s)]
*  efficiency, and so on and so on. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=558.36s)]
*  But behind this, what you call nostalgia is for me nonetheless, it's much more dramatic, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=562.76s)]
*  if you want it. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=571.84s)]
*  I am the first to admit, and that's my, maybe we shared your opinion here, that's my criticism [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=572.84s)]
*  of one of the criticisms of Frankfurt School. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=579.28s)]
*  As I always repeat, look at Habermas, at his work he began publishing in the early 50s. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=582.8s)]
*  Read all his work, and I don't think you will ever guess from his published text that there [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=590.56s)]
*  is something like communism in East Germany. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=597.4s)]
*  Frankfurt School in a strange way, almost totally, I know there is Marcuse's book, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=601.4s)]
*  Soviet Marxism, but it's very specific. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=606.12s)]
*  And you know what makes it so strange? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=608.92s)]
*  The central thesis of late Frankfurt School is a dialectic of enlightenment. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=610.68s)]
*  Horrors of 20th century, fascism, Stalinism, are not simply regressions to some dark past, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=616.76s)]
*  they are deployment of a certain totalitarian, whatever we call them, potentials in the project [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=624.86s)]
*  of modernity itself. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=632.76s)]
*  Okay, but isn't Stalinism a much more traumatic example of this than fascism? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=635.4s)]
*  With fascism things are relatively simple, I think. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=643.2s)]
*  It's a model of conservative revolution and so on and so on. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=646.04s)]
*  But Bolshevism, which tried to do a radical emancipation and it turned into a traumatic [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=649.48s)]
*  knife, I think even today we don't have a good theory of Stalinism, that's what bothers [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=656.56s)]
*  me. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=661.48s)]
*  I will give you as a proof that it's not in this sense nostalgia, I will give you another [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=663.2s)]
*  example. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=667.88s)]
*  I have such a memory, I always tell my friends jokes about life in the army. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=668.88s)]
*  I served in the mid-70s in Yugoslav army. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=676.36s)]
*  But you know, it was a nightmare, I know. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=680.32s)]
*  But what fascinated me was I never did I learn so much about ideology and my politically [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=684.6800000000001s)]
*  correct friend. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=692.44s)]
*  For example, I wonder if some of you know, you don't have here any more military service [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=693.44s)]
*  in Norway. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=697.76s)]
*  But basically on the one hand Yugoslav army was, as all armies probably, absolutely homophobic. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=698.76s)]
*  You were gay, you were beaten by fellow soldiers every night, discreetly, before being thrown [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=705.48s)]
*  out. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=711.84s)]
*  But at the same time, crucial, absolutely crucial, the entire life was totally penetrated [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=712.84s)]
*  by homosexual innuendos and so on. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=720.76s)]
*  In my unit we didn't say good morning, we say I'll smoke your prick, thanks and after [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=723.6s)]
*  I finish with yours. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=729.04s)]
*  So you see, all these paradoxes, what fascinates me about ideology is, and this is where communism [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=730.48s)]
*  interests me, is how, this is why Yugoslavia, which was relatively liberal communism, interests [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=739.48s)]
*  me. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=746.76s)]
*  But in Yugoslavia, it wasn't like we have our own ideology, self-managed socialism. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=748.16s)]
*  I mean this literally. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=754.52s)]
*  Slovenia was a small country, we knew everybody else, nomenclatura. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=755.52s)]
*  This is sounding like more nostalgia to me. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=760.28s)]
*  Army tales, we talked about smoking the prick, right? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=762.56s)]
*  Okay, but the lesson I learned there, I don't care if you call it nostalgia, the lesson [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=765.96s)]
*  I, and I will tell you where I see real nostalgia today. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=772.16s)]
*  The lesson for me is how an ideology can function, not only even if you don't believe in it, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=776.04s)]
*  but it is prohibited to believe in it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=784.8s)]
*  This was the beautiful paradox of ex-Yugoslavia. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=788.5999999999999s)]
*  I had two friends who worked in the Central Committee of the Slovene Party. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=791.8s)]
*  They lost their job, you know why? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=796.0s)]
*  Because they were stupid and took the ruling ideology too seriously. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=798.02s)]
*  But you know who are for me, change the topic but along the same line, the true nostalgic [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=801.74s)]
*  today. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=806.1800000000001s)]
*  That's why I don't like the novel. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=807.1800000000001s)]
*  This will again hurt some of you. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=809.1800000000001s)]
*  Margaret Atwood Handmaid's Tale. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=811.1800000000001s)]
*  This is for me true nostalgia. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=814.02s)]
*  It's what Frederick Lansom called nostalgia for the present. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  It paints this horrible near future. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=820.26s)]
*  It doesn't raise the crucial question. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=822.9s)]
*  But she's still too fascinated by our permissive societies and so on and so on. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=826.14s)]
*  You know for... [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=832.78s)]
*  Sorry, go on. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=833.78s)]
*  These are side issues. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=834.78s)]
*  If I visit your debate with Jordan Peterson, it's on YouTube, I felt you won that debate [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=835.78s)]
*  and it's striking to me the discussion between one hour, ten minutes, and one hour, eighteen [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=839.66s)]
*  minutes. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=844.34s)]
*  And in that part of the discussion you say that you calling yourself a communist is a [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=845.34s)]
*  bit of a provocation. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=849.14s)]
*  But now I'd like to draw a comparison. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=851.22s)]
*  Take the writer who just won the Nobel Prize in literature, Peter Huntgen, right? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=853.7s)]
*  Sometimes called an Austrian but he's ethnic Slovene. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=857.98s)]
*  He has sympathized with the Serbian atrocities. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=861.62s)]
*  And you are hard on him, correctly so. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=865.1400000000001s)]
*  You don't give him the space of that being a provocation. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=868.5s)]
*  He is so close to your world that you apply a more absolutist moral standard and you want [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=872.24s)]
*  him to jettison his Serbian nostalgia and I am submitting that... [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=878.0600000000001s)]
*  I have no nostalgia. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=882.1s)]
*  For what do I have nostalgia? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=883.1s)]
*  The attachment to the label communist. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=885.14s)]
*  You can do everything you want without that word, without the concept, without having [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=887.78s)]
*  to apologize for the history. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=892.0600000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's go step by step, Huntgen. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=893.0600000000001s)]
*  I know the old joke. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=894.0600000000001s)]
*  What's the difference between a communist and a Nazi? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=895.38s)]
*  Tenure, right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=897.46s)]
*  You mean university tenure or not? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=898.46s)]
*  Yes, it's a joke but the point is you don't need communism. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=901.14s)]
*  You are much smarter than communism. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=906.14s)]
*  Let's go step by step. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=908.58s)]
*  First, Huntgen. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=909.58s)]
*  My criticism of him was very specific. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=911.0600000000001s)]
*  And correct. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=913.26s)]
*  Even before he got involved into what he got involved to, I didn't like the game he played. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=914.26s)]
*  For example, I remember his stats from 30 years ago, 40, before, where he said in Austria [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=920.0200000000001s)]
*  everything is commodified. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=927.46s)]
*  You go to a store, every brand of milk has a name. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=929.22s)]
*  You cross the border to poor Slovenia. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=932.9000000000001s)]
*  It just says milk with no brand name and so on. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=935.1s)]
*  And what I hate is, we should agree even here. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=939.5400000000001s)]
*  What I call, borrowing the term of my friend, another Austrian philosopher, Robert Fowler, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=942.74s)]
*  inter-passive authenticity. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=949.38s)]
*  You want to keep your well, good life in the West but you like to be authentic through [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=951.74s)]
*  others. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=957.5s)]
*  This is why we were very good. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=958.5s)]
*  He was proud to refer to us, Slovenians, Huntgen. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=960.94s)]
*  Insofar as we were the modest poor communists. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=964.1s)]
*  The moment we wanted our own state, join European Union, we betrayed his dream. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=967.74s)]
*  That's why maybe you know in the text I quote this wonderful saying by Gilles Deleuze, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=973.7s)]
*  si vous êtes pris dans le rêve de l'autre, vous êtes faits pour deux. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=979.1800000000001s)]
*  If you are caught into another's dream. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=982.42s)]
*  And that's for me, we should agree here, the big problem of Western academic left. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=985.26s)]

*  When I was young it was Cuba, then it was a decade ago, Venezuela and so on and so on. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=995.66s)]
*  No nothing great happens elsewhere and so on. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1004.02s)]
*  And to my Serb friends, I declare that they will see if they will succeed too well, he [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1007.9399999999999s)]

*  in this room. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1047.22s)]
*  I was for five years unemployed, I had to survive through parents and so on and so on. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1048.4599999999998s)]
*  So I was there when it was needed and so on. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1054.8999999999999s)]
*  And I'm even a little bit proud to say that the role I played at that time is that when [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1059.1399999999999s)]

*  And we did it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1082.7s)]
*  But you know what, for me, again, I return to that. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1085.02s)]

*  No, we need much more than that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1097.34s)]

*  Bill Gates says he's a socialist and so on. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1110.66s)]
*  It's meaningless. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1113.26s)]

*  Your Gulag sentence is redoubled now. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1137.02s)]
*  But one thing I crave is to one day just see you writing about a question like the electric [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1139.9s)]
*  tram in Bergen. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1145.0600000000002s)]
*  Should it go through a tunnel or not? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1146.46s)]
*  And you would not be allowed to mention Fukuyama. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1150.26s)]
*  You couldn't use the C word, capitalism or communism. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1153.0800000000002s)]
*  And just analyze that question or look at a municipal bus system in Denmark somewhere. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1156.94s)]
*  And those to me are in some ways more real questions. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1162.06s)]
*  Here maybe we have a misunderstanding because I will tell you why not this. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1164.9s)]
*  This may surprise you, the answer. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1168.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1170.3s)]
*  First, you know, I tremendous, this was the point, you know, when in my short speech, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1171.3s)]
*  when I said I despise for me the model of catastrophe today. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1177.74s)]
*  My friends, they cried. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1183.34s)]
*  Tahrir Square, Syntagma. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1184.98s)]
*  We were there. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1186.98s)]
*  One million people. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1187.98s)]
*  We were all crying. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1189.58s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1190.9399999999998s)]
*  I say F off. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1191.9399999999998s)]
*  What interests me, I hope we agree here, is what happens two months later? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1193.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm all for this pragmatic, concrete problems. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1199.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm not waiting for a big revolution. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1204.58s)]
*  Now this may surprise you for somebody who may sound so bombastic and pretentious like [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1208.8999999999999s)]
*  me. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1214.06s)]
*  You know, strange as it will sound, but I don't know everything. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1215.06s)]
*  I'm immediately thinking in literal terms what to do, so many factors. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1219.5s)]
*  I don't know enough. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1226.1799999999998s)]
*  I like this totally concrete empirical problems. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1228.1399999999999s)]
*  I like paradoxes. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1231.8999999999999s)]
*  For example, would you agree very briefly? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1233.8999999999999s)]
*  Maybe you found this in one of my books. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1237.34s)]
*  I'm not quoting this as an argument for anti-capitalism. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1238.98s)]
*  I don't know that. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1243.06s)]
*  But there are some group experiments which fascinate me, which proves that you cannot [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1244.18s)]
*  reduce some forms of solidarity to money. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1252.46s)]
*  A Jewish friend from Israel told me this. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1256.02s)]
*  They had a kindergarten there. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1258.98s)]
*  And the story is apocryphal. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1261.46s)]
*  People have tried to follow up on the kindergarten in Israel story. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1263.82s)]
*  This is probably not true. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1266.82s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1268.1s)]
*  Are we talking about when they made it, when they made pay even less? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1269.1s)]
*  We're not sure this is true. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1273.62s)]
*  I've looked into it. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1274.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1275.74s)]
*  It's possibly true. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1276.74s)]
*  It cannot be confirmed. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1277.74s)]
*  But I accept the point. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1278.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1279.74s)]
*  The point is that I believe it surprisingly. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1280.74s)]
*  And when I talk about communism and so on, my God, I've written texts on it and now I [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1283.4199999999998s)]
*  go on into it into. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1288.98s)]
*  communism is just as I emphasize and the name of a problem is not a solution. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1292.18s)]
*  You know, now I will say something that will shock you. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1297.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm well aware of some of my communist friends admitted that even if we imagine something [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1301.22s)]
*  similar to communism, the mega problem will be envy and so on. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1306.78s)]
*  And this is who is one of the great guys, my God, the one who conducted Chile according [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1312.6200000000001s)]
*  to leftist mythology, not Pinochet, the economist, free market, who advised Pinochet according [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1317.58s)]
*  to our burger. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1324.22s)]
*  No, no, no, no, the big guy. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1325.22s)]
*  I think he only visited once or twice. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1328.1399999999999s)]
*  That was not my point. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1331.78s)]
*  But one of those guys, when reproached with the fact that but capitalism is unjust, you [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1333.5s)]
*  work hard, you fail, your neighbor was there, he said, but that's why capitalism works, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1339.8999999999999s)]
*  because he said your pride survives intact. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1345.38s)]
*  Let's say we are two guys, we live in a society and if there is no luck and injustice, this [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1349.5800000000002s)]
*  means if you are richer than me, I have to admit that I'm more stupid than you. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1356.38s)]
*  But capitalist injustice, it's a very elegant argument. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1361.46s)]
*  communism is easy in a way. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1365.18s)]
*  You always have an excuse, right? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1366.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1367.66s)]
*  The system screwed you over. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1368.66s)]
*  And you're always right. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1369.66s)]
*  Now I will ask you, this is my big argument against happiness. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1370.66s)]
*  Do you agree if you are now like my Stasi observer, you have your list? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1373.78s)]
*  You remember when I argue about happiness against, I take as an example, and I was there, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1378.82s)]
*  I talked with people who sucks, Kekoslovakia in the seventies, material needs were basically [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1384.86s)]
*  satisfied. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1392.12s)]
*  Nobody was doing that. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1393.54s)]
*  And as you said, you always had an excuse. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1395.54s)]
*  There was too much rain or drought, communists screwed it up. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1398.1399999999999s)]
*  Then very important, you had a nearby country, West Germany, which was the ideal other, but [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1401.66s)]
*  it was not too far away and so on. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1408.46s)]
*  That's why I'm against happiness. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1410.66s)]
*  Happiness means no responsibility, relatively comfortable life, you know, because after [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1412.78s)]
*  already after Khrushchev basically with Brezhnev, you must know this, communist in power made [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1419.3000000000002s)]
*  a pact with population. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1424.94s)]
*  They admitted we will never reach the West, but the message was you leave us political [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1427.86s)]
*  power, we leave you your private niche where you can enjoy your life and so on and so on. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1432.9799999999998s)]
*  I think that Khrushchev was paradoxically, don't you agree, the last guy who somehow [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1439.02s)]
*  paradoxically, you know, he was sincere in that, you must know it, United Nations speech [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1446.6599999999999s)]
*  where he, the last epoch where the ruling nomenclatura has still believed in happiness [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1451.3799999999999s)]
*  in communism. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1457.78s)]
*  After that, it's a totally different logic of emancipation. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1458.78s)]
*  Some of the communists in power, I love this in Yugoslavia, even referred to Marcuse Frankfurt [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1463.62s)]
*  School, they said, but you know, in the West you have commodification, alienation, here [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1469.18s)]
*  you can take it easy, it's more poor and so on and so on, you know. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1474.74s)]
*  Sorry, I talk too much. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1479.06s)]
*  Let me praise you some more. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1480.06s)]
*  No, no. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1481.62s)]
*  Yes, all your books I've read, one of my favorite things in the books is how much humor you [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1482.62s)]
*  have and in person, whether speaking or over breakfast, your humor, which is based on [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1486.74s)]
*  insight rather than any young men type of jokes, is phenomenally good. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1495.06s)]
*  But here's what strikes me, you have the humor of a right-winger, of a right-wing moderate. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1500.38s)]
*  So if you think of today's left, it is increasingly humorless, you're not allowed to talk about [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1505.44s)]
*  so many things. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1510.58s)]
*  On gender, your views are much more right-wing than left-wing. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1512.06s)]
*  So the left-wing is moving. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1516.3400000000001s)]
*  When I sit down with my right-wing friends and they joke around, their jokes are in broad [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1518.5800000000002s)]
*  terms like yours, left-wing humor. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1523.4s)]
*  My answer to this, not humor, it's a very simple one. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1525.22s)]
*  My answer to this is, that's why the political correct leftists are doing all possible to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1529.5s)]
*  get Trump re-elected, if you ask me. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1535.78s)]
*  A little bit more years on this and we will be where we are, but let me add as a sign [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1538.3400000000001s)]
*  of friendship to you, another bad-taste humor about you. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1543.06s)]
*  You are my friend, I like you. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1547.46s)]
*  So when we commonly stake over, nonetheless, because you're objectively guilty, you go [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1549.98s)]
*  to Gulag. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1556.46s)]
*  But as a special favor to you, you know what you got on better days in Gulag, on shark [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1557.46s)]
*  day? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1563.42s)]
*  Some kind of disgusting soup in trails and hatched half-rotten fishes and potatoes. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1564.42s)]
*  Maybe some bread in it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1569.98s)]
*  Don't exaggerate. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1572.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1573.1s)]
*  I will call from my Moscow center and isn't it nice? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1574.1s)]
*  You will get two plates of that soup. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1579.6599999999999s)]
*  Do you agree you have an increasingly right-wing sense of humor and that if we're going to [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1584.1399999999999s)]
*  be true Freudians... [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1588.02s)]
*  But why do you call it right-wing? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1589.02s)]
*  When I was young, this was left-wing humor. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1590.78s)]
*  It is no longer left-wing humor. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1593.74s)]
*  The world has moved on. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1595.1799999999998s)]
*  Then so much worse for the left. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1596.1799999999998s)]
*  Perhaps for the worse. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1597.1799999999998s)]
*  Okay, we're making progress. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1598.1799999999998s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1599.8999999999999s)]
*  Or indeed the moderate right, communist nostalgia, rump state communist who is maybe almost ready [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1600.9s)]
*  to abandon that final bit of the nostalgia. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1607.3400000000001s)]
*  Don't count on that too much because I still think that the crisis will hit us. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1609.3000000000002s)]
*  I see signs. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1615.3400000000001s)]
*  Here comes my pessimism. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1616.3400000000001s)]
*  I think that the situation today with new right-wing blah, blah, blah, and here, as [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1617.3400000000001s)]
*  we already talked about it, I'm very open. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1623.3400000000001s)]
*  For example, do they exist here? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1625.7800000000002s)]
*  We talked about it. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1627.6599999999999s)]
*  So-called incels, involuntary celibates. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1628.6599999999999s)]
*  Usually they are decried as the worst. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1631.6599999999999s)]
*  Women hating fascists. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1634.5s)]
*  No, they do something I think almost tragic. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1635.8999999999999s)]
*  They try to turn their failure and already this is politically incorrect to state today. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1640.82s)]
*  You cannot address a woman almost it's prohibited saying she's beautiful. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1647.6999999999998s)]
*  You cannot say to a man you are non-attractive enough. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1652.62s)]
*  You cannot get any woman. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1656.46s)]
*  But that's their experience. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1658.26s)]
*  And I admire how without any imminent violence they turn this into a wonderful performance, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1659.8600000000001s)]
*  especially clown cells and so on. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1667.58s)]
*  It's a wonderful way to survive a pretty terrifying predicament. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1669.8600000000001s)]
*  And I don't buy that they are automatically neo-fascists and so on. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1674.8600000000001s)]
*  Concerning feminism and by reproach to me too is not there to radical and so on. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1679.06s)]
*  But it's a upper middle class fake. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1685.34s)]
*  American feminism should first do, I hope we agree here, a little bit of a good old-fashioned [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1688.54s)]
*  Stalinist you will say again nostalgia, self-criticism. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1694.22s)]
*  You know there are so many things of American feminism. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1698.3s)]
*  Do you know for example they support that American invasion of Iraq that it will help [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1701.34s)]
*  women? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1706.82s)]
*  Well, we know today that the situation of women today in Iraq is much worse than under [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1707.82s)]
*  Saddam. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1714.66s)]
*  Saddam was a brutal despot but relatively secular. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1715.66s)]
*  This is what bothers me. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1721.18s)]
*  Second problem, you will again say I'm conservative here. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1723.5s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1726.38s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1727.38s)]
*  The problem with political correctness is for me that questions which are questions [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1728.38s)]
*  of not manners in a superficial sense but of customs. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1734.8600000000001s)]
*  Here I am as you know a Hegelian. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1739.5400000000002s)]
*  Hegel always emphasized the basis that whole society together are unwritten rules, customs [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1742.1s)]
*  and so on. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1749.02s)]
*  Political correctness tries too much to legalize it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1750.7s)]
*  You know you are allowed to call this name. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1754.3799999999999s)]
*  For example, let me give you a provocative example. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1757.1s)]
*  You know it to provoke you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1759.34s)]
*  Once I problematize this idea of consent, even bureaucratic consent, you have to state [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1761.26s)]
*  on a selfie sign before mutual agreement and they say oh so I think we can rape women. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1768.9s)]
*  We don't need consent. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1776.3400000000001s)]
*  They totally misread me on the opposite. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1777.82s)]
*  I just claim consent in itself is good, better than nothing, but it doesn't solve the problem. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1780.38s)]
*  There is so much pressure, violence which can survive the form of consent. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1787.9s)]
*  There is a formal consent, sexual exploitation can go on and so on and so on. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1796.26s)]
*  My problem with LGBT+, as if I am attacking them, no. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1800.9399999999998s)]
*  The problem I see there, I wonder if you agree, is this one. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1805.2199999999998s)]
*  I have a problem with identity politics. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1808.3799999999999s)]
*  The problem is that the idea of predominant, there are many LGBT+, who are extremely good [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1811.1799999999998s)]
*  theorists, persons, but the predominant view is the one of this one. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1819.02s)]
*  I simplify it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1824.66s)]
*  There is some kind of multiplicity of gender positions, it's almost the Maoist version. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1825.66s)]
*  Let the 100 flowers blossom. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1832.3s)]
*  Let 100 boots, gender, bisect, trisect and then even patriarchy comes, imposes the binary [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1835.5s)]
*  division. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1843.54s)]
*  Let's get rid of this and some of them even establish a list, 30, 35 positions. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1845.1399999999999s)]
*  My God, and then they say Freud is outdated. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1850.1399999999999s)]
*  If there is anything to learn from Freud, is that sexuality is in itself antagonist, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1854.02s)]
*  traumatic, shady domains and so on and so on. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1860.8999999999999s)]
*  That's my first point. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1864.62s)]
*  What bothers me in LGBT+, is as if if we get rid of social pressure, we get some kind of [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1869.3400000000001s)]
*  shabby sexuality. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1877.02s)]
*  The first presupposition that I doubt here is because you do what you desire. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1879.3400000000001s)]
*  My God, didn't they read Freud? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1883.42s)]
*  How do you know that you really desire what you think that you desire? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1886.1000000000001s)]
*  There are all the ambiguities here. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1889.7s)]
*  My second problem, and that's the theoretical one, let's move into Hegel a little bit, maybe [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1891.78s)]
*  you know my line. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1896.3s)]
*  LGBT+, it's all about plus, because the ordinary LGBT theorists are for me two British empiricists. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1897.6599999999999s)]
*  Plus is for them simply, maybe we don't yet know all identities, let's leave it open. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1906.6599999999999s)]
*  Maybe there will be other gender identities, we will include them. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1913.18s)]
*  No. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1916.94s)]
*  As I got this, I forgot Karnay, I'm sorry, from an Australian LGBT theorist, very intelligent [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1917.94s)]
*  lady, who wrote to me, but what if plus itself is a subjective position? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1924.82s)]
*  You can be a plus in the sense of, you know, at a distance, doubting, and I think this [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1931.34s)]
*  is feminine position, at its stronger, I will go to absolutely everyday level. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1937.26s)]
*  That's why the most provocative woman's answer is, why do you love me? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1943.78s)]
*  Because there is no answer to this question. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1949.58s)]
*  The moment you answer it, it's not true love, by definition. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1951.98s)]
*  If I tell you why I love you, then it becomes a matter of, you know, so what I'm saying [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1955.18s)]
*  is that I just try to complicate things. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1961.18s)]
*  Why not move to Singapore? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1963.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1964.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a wonderful country, and if you ask which nation has the quality of government and the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1965.6200000000001s)]
*  thoughtfulness and the long time horizon to actually deal with ecological problems, are [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1970.9s)]
*  they not near or at the top of the list? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1975.74s)]
*  And therefore, you and I can join hands in embracing Singapore and presenting it to the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1978.22s)]
*  world? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1983.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, here I may be pretty good, but isn't it that Singapore nonetheless enjoys its role [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1984.1000000000001s)]
*  as structural an exception? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1991.78s)]
*  I don't think you can expand Singapore to Indonesia, already with Malaysia there are [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1993.82s)]
*  problems and so on and so on. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=1998.14s)]
*  Well every country is different, but clearly Singapore has more. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2000.54s)]
*  I remember that Singapore port is even at some point it was the busiest port in the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2004.38s)]
*  world and so on, which means they are kind of a nodal point for the countries around [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2010.46s)]
*  them and so on. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2016.62s)]
*  I doubt. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2017.62s)]
*  Second thing, maybe I have here too much liberal sensitivity, but nonetheless, you know, it's [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2018.62s)]
*  a kind of a, the way I would define Singapore, you may disagree, is fascism with the human [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2025.74s)]
*  face. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2032.18s)]
*  A very human face, it's consensual and so on, but there are so strict limits, even at [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2033.18s)]
*  the everyday ridiculous level. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2038.8200000000002s)]
*  For example, I was there with my son who wanted some chewing gum. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2041.22s)]
*  We went to a store and they laughed at me, are you crazy? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2044.5800000000002s)]
*  You have to go to pharmacy. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2047.8600000000001s)]
*  We went to a pharmacy, they said, okay, where do you have doctor's prescription? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2049.62s)]
*  I said no. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2053.58s)]
*  But this is fine, this is not fascism. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2054.58s)]
*  Singapore did that because too many people were leaving the chewing gum on the subway [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2057.02s)]
*  doors and it was creating a problem. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2061.14s)]
*  Maybe they overreacted. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2062.8599999999997s)]
*  Now you are exaggerating. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2063.8599999999997s)]
*  If you're criticism is Singapore is about the chewing gum, I say come join me at the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2064.8599999999997s)]
*  food stalls, right? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2068.62s)]
*  Where? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2069.62s)]
*  In Singapore? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2070.62s)]
*  Yeah, I know where all the best ones are, right? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2071.62s)]
*  Jump on board, forget the communist thing. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2074.14s)]
*  The nostalgia can be for Singapore 13 years ago, which in some ways was less crowded, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2076.5s)]
*  right? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2081.1s)]
*  It's a better nostalgia. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2082.1s)]
*  No, no, no, but again, don't you see where my communism comes? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2083.1s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2087.1s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2088.54s)]
*  It's not where you think. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2089.54s)]
*  I don't think there is any link with me clinging to the name communism and my nostalgia. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2091.86s)]
*  Those times, I'm well aware, were more or less a nightmare. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2097.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm listen, one reason against nostalgia is that I was jobless. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2100.9s)]
*  Although you may know this joke, something wonderful happened. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2107.9s)]
*  When people asked me which was the key factor for your relative success in the West, I told [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2111.7999999999997s)]
*  them communist oppression because I applied for a job when I finished my postdoctoral [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2117.58s)]
*  studies in 1973 and this was the harsh line. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2122.66s)]
*  I couldn't get the job. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2127.02s)]
*  And then I was for a couple of years unemployed. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2129.06s)]
*  I was looking for contacts in the West. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2131.94s)]
*  Without communist oppression, I would have been now an unknown professor in city of Ljubljana, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2134.66s)]
*  Slovenia. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2140.38s)]
*  Sometimes you remind me of Leibach, the Slovenian rock group. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2141.38s)]
*  They are my friend, my God. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2145.1s)]
*  I'm with them from late 80s and now things get complicated there. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2146.7s)]
*  You know why? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2151.8599999999997s)]
*  Because many leftists who support them are nonetheless afraid. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2152.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay, they are staging totalitarian rituals. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2157.74s)]
*  What if some people will take it seriously and so on? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2162.06s)]
*  And once they were asked, are you a fascist? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2165.22s)]
*  And one of them said, I am a fascist like Hitler was a painter. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2167.2599999999998s)]
*  What answer is that? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2171.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2172.62s)]
*  Why can't they just say I'm not a fascist? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2174.86s)]
*  And then you could say I'm not a communist and you and Leibach and we could all meet [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2177.5800000000004s)]
*  in the food stalls of Singapore, Taiwan. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2181.5800000000004s)]
*  Have a nice time, right? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2184.94s)]
*  Work on better batteries so solar power can really save us. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2186.34s)]
*  We could have the government subsidize better battery technology. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2190.1400000000003s)]
*  I know it's not all we need to do but then think about that electric tram and the tunnel. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2193.5400000000004s)]
*  Another unsettling thing. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2198.5400000000004s)]
*  I can tell you from my personal contact with Leibach that they don't mean it as an ironic [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2200.22s)]
*  spectacle. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2205.74s)]
*  They are very serious in their harsh line. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2206.74s)]
*  That's what I like about them. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2208.82s)]
*  They are not, don't be afraid, we are not really totalitarian. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2210.2599999999998s)]
*  It's just one big social game and so on and so on. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2213.38s)]
*  But at a certain point I didn't want to join them because they wanted me, you probably [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2217.46s)]
*  know two years ago when they went to North Korea. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2222.58s)]
*  No it would be too much. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2227.38s)]
*  Sure, of course. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2228.8199999999997s)]
*  I didn't want to do it. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2229.8199999999997s)]
*  Too communist for you. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2230.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2231.8199999999997s)]
*  No but nonetheless, you know what was so interesting with Leibach? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2232.8199999999997s)]
*  Here you have the complexity of ideological process that all this fear, will they be manipulated [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2237.74s)]
*  by radical right and so on, they never were. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2244.8199999999997s)]
*  Whenever they are popular, it's never the right. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2248.8999999999996s)]
*  I know what the right wingers, at least in Europe, are listening. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2253.1s)]
*  It's not the German version of Leibach. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2257.34s)]
*  There was some influence. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2259.82s)]
*  Do you know Rammstein, the group? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2260.82s)]
*  Link, links, they are left and it's a beautiful, the right thing to do for the left to appropriate [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2262.86s)]
*  this horrible totalitarian sounding stuff and so on and so on. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2269.9s)]
*  The right wingers that I know, they think beautiful romantic songs are political usually [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2274.5s)]
*  and so on and so on. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2280.86s)]
*  But still, you know where you, I get your point, of course. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2282.5s)]
*  I still, when you said no, something more will be needed. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2285.78s)]
*  Ask you, what more? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2289.6200000000003s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2291.42s)]
*  You say no, no, no, it's not. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2292.42s)]
*  I know ecology and so on, digital control. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2294.2200000000003s)]
*  Can you any idea what, what more will be needed? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2298.94s)]
*  What do you think that ecological party will be elected? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2302.82s)]
*  I hope so, maybe. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2306.2200000000003s)]
*  That's why I like it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2307.2200000000003s)]
*  I was told that in Bergen, it's 20% electric cars. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2308.2200000000003s)]
*  Now I don't know what Bergen did to get that, but many parts of the world could learn from [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2311.42s)]
*  whatever has been done here. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2316.2200000000003s)]
*  And we're at 20, let's work for 60, right? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2317.5s)]
*  Yeah, but on the other hand, my only not criticism of Norway is that you have oil, gas and so [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2319.98s)]
*  on, you know. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2325.94s)]
*  You can, we can, I would like to learn from Norway, but I would like even more if you [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2326.94s)]
*  give me your natural resources. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2331.7000000000003s)]
*  To earn from the oil and then divest from fossil fuels. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2334.34s)]
*  Although I have one argument for you here. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2337.1800000000003s)]
*  The good thing about Singapore is that they have no natural resources, no? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2339.94s)]
*  Well they do a lot of refining there, so. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2344.34s)]
*  Refining, yes, but no, no. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2346.34s)]
*  Not that I'm aware of. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2348.9s)]
*  But what, what made it? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2350.3s)]
*  Is it kind of one incidental conjunction? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2352.5s)]
*  That what I would have maybe said about Singapore of this Chinese proclivity to hard work and [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2356.62s)]
*  English legislation or what? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2362.7000000000003s)]
*  There must have been some unique combination there. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2364.7400000000002s)]
*  Keep in mind the Chinese themselves felt at first that the Chinese who went to Singapore [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2366.98s)]
*  were kind of the losers who were not doing well in China, the poorly educated peasants, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2371.02s)]
*  but the Singaporean government thought let's invest in human capital. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2375.54s)]
*  When? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2378.82s)]
*  Which government? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2379.82s)]
*  I'm talking about Likwad Niu. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2380.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2381.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2382.82s)]
*  And it worked for the most part. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2383.82s)]
*  But what then your problem with China? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2384.82s)]
*  Because do you know, you must know this, that at the beginning of history forums, Deng Xiaoping [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2386.6600000000003s)]
*  came to Singapore, everybody, everywhere there they saw it and said Singapore should be a [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2391.94s)]
*  model for. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2396.06s)]
*  It is time for China to liberalize. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2397.06s)]
*  I don't see them doing that. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2399.06s)]
*  They seem to be moving in the opposite direction. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2400.2599999999998s)]
*  Here and now we touch the true problem. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2402.34s)]
*  Sorry, now I'm not losing time. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2404.38s)]
*  You know where I am a pessimist. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2406.42s)]
*  Some of my liberal friends tell me, oh, China achieved so much with full political liberalization. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2409.02s)]
*  They would have achieved even more. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2416.54s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2418.18s)]
*  We don't know the counterfactual. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2419.34s)]
*  Speaking of counterfactual. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2420.62s)]
*  I love them. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2421.62s)]
*  I have a question for you about Donald Trump. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2422.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2423.82s)]
*  He initially said, well, if Trump wins, it could be good because it will revitalize the [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2424.86s)]
*  left. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2429.2200000000003s)]
*  He did. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2430.2200000000003s)]
*  There was then another article where people asked you, did you really mean it? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2431.2200000000003s)]
*  And you said it maybe a year ago. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2434.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2435.86s)]
*  But I look at the Democratic race. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2436.86s)]
*  Front runner number one is Joseph Biden, age, I think, 77. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2438.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2441.1000000000004s)]
*  He was vice president for eight years. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2442.1000000000004s)]
*  Mayor Pete is now number two because he took a moderate stance. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2443.78s)]
*  Sorry, who is named? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2446.5800000000004s)]
*  Mayor Pete, Buttigieg. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2447.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2448.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't know how to pronounce that name. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2449.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure I do either. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2451.7400000000002s)]
*  But he's mayor from South Bend, Indiana. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2452.94s)]
*  To me, you know, a perfectly fine candidate. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2455.9s)]
*  And the Democratic conservatives are in the ascendancy. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2458.44s)]
*  And where the Democrats have gone hard left is identity politics. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2461.18s)]
*  And that's exactly the thing you hate. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2464.3s)]
*  So why has it been good? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2466.42s)]
*  Four years of Trump, maybe eight years of Trump. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2467.9s)]
*  We don't have time to go into it, but let me be specific. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2471.26s)]
*  Democrats who go for identity politics, already Hillary tried this against Donald Trump. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2474.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2479.94s)]
*  Against Bernie Sanders. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2480.94s)]
*  That's why I admire Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said something very ingenious. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2483.78s)]
*  You must have read it. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2489.5s)]
*  Who said recently endorsing Bernie Sanders, I endorse him not in spite of him being an [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2491.34s)]
*  old white man, but because. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2497.78s)]
*  Her idea was this one. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2499.7000000000003s)]
*  Bernie Sanders can get us, we don't need a center. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2501.98s)]
*  We just are obsessed if you go too much to the left, we lose this, sentry's boast, and [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2506.82s)]
*  so on. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2510.6200000000003s)]
*  Trump did exactly the opposite. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2511.6200000000003s)]
*  I think the target of the Democratic Party should be those impoverished white, half unemployed [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2513.1400000000003s)]
*  workers who otherwise would have voted for Trump. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2519.82s)]
*  Not those middle of the road, and so on and so on. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2522.78s)]
*  Trump is a genius here. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2525.9s)]
*  How he broke all the rules and so on. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2527.5800000000004s)]
*  Because do you remember how often in his campaign when he said something, I know preposterous, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2530.1800000000003s)]
*  horrible, liberal press said, oh, Trump just shot himself, he's over and so on. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2535.38s)]
*  No, it's not over. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2541.46s)]
*  Trump proved that sometimes the only way to majority is through extremes. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2542.82s)]
*  It's not always that center works. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2547.58s)]
*  But I worry here there's a parallel. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2549.7400000000002s)]
*  Your views and pronouncements on Trump and on communism. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2551.42s)]
*  So in the case of Trump, you think, well, I can say this, I have a vision that will [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2554.38s)]
*  work out a particular way. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2558.2200000000003s)]
*  The Democratic left will be revitalized. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2559.82s)]
*  But it lost. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2561.46s)]
*  Maybe, they may lose. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2562.46s)]
*  The identity politics. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2563.54s)]
*  It lost revitalized. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2564.54s)]
*  And the moderates are on the rise. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2565.54s)]
*  And then there's a sense of, well, I can attach myself to communism. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2567.54s)]
*  I have a particular theory that will work out some way. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2570.86s)]
*  It will tell us we always need more when it comes to ecology. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2573.66s)]
*  But that to me seems like the Trump prediction. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2576.82s)]
*  We know from the work of Philip Tlok, it's just very hard to predict the future. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2578.9s)]
*  So why not stand up directly for just the right values? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2582.78s)]
*  Like take Greta Thunberg, right? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2585.98s)]
*  I don't agree with everything she says, but her core message is correct. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2587.82s)]
*  She is unambiguous. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2591.9399999999996s)]
*  She's to the point. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2592.9399999999996s)]
*  It's not ironic. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2593.9399999999996s)]
*  There's got some complicated theory. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2594.9399999999996s)]
*  Okay, exactly. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2595.9399999999996s)]
*  He is the contemporary communist for me. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2596.9399999999996s)]
*  Fully. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2598.9399999999996s)]
*  You know why? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2599.9399999999996s)]
*  He's not a communist. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2600.9399999999996s)]
*  No, but you know what? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2601.9399999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2602.9399999999996s)]
*  Forget. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2603.9399999999996s)]
*  You know what I like about her? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2604.9399999999996s)]
*  You're telling me Magnus Carlsen is a communist next. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2605.9399999999996s)]
*  Okay, but you know what I like about Greta Thunberg? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2606.9399999999996s)]
*  First, you remember some media in Europe tried to blame her parents. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2608.66s)]
*  You know, they are manipulating her. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2613.8199999999997s)]
*  My answer was, I hope they do. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2616.1s)]
*  I hope. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2618.02s)]
*  I shouldn't with the left also manipulate. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2619.02s)]
*  But what I like is precisely I didn't like her at the beginning. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2621.86s)]
*  You remember when she played that innocent girl who is telling us that the emperor is [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2625.9s)]
*  naked. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2632.14s)]
*  But did you notice how in the last year of men she has this almost a little bit of diabolic [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2633.14s)]
*  aggressive smile? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2638.46s)]
*  I like the mean Greta Thunberg. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2639.62s)]
*  I don't like the good innocent girl. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2641.98s)]
*  And I also refer to her. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2644.42s)]
*  For me, she's deeply feminine, but not the usual notion of femininity promoted by the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2646.96s)]
*  media today. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2653.6400000000003s)]
*  Holistic dialogue. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2654.6400000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2655.6400000000003s)]
*  She's quite dogmatic in this sense. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2656.6400000000003s)]
*  That's what we need today. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2660.84s)]
*  And I don't need anything more. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2662.32s)]
*  Okay, we can debate the name. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2664.04s)]
*  But I think that what she's doing is definitely communist today for me. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2665.92s)]
*  Greta Thunberg, Assange, and so on. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2671.88s)]
*  Incidentally, do you know the story? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2674.56s)]
*  I must repeat it to you. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2676.48s)]
*  I hope all of you don't know it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2677.6s)]
*  When I visited him two weeks ago in prison. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2679.12s)]
*  It's wonderful. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2682.08s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2683.08s)]
*  I'm sorry if some of you know it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2684.44s)]
*  I was sitting close to him like this in open space at the table. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2685.96s)]
*  A friend brought me a cup of coffee, plastic cover. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2690.68s)]
*  I took the cover off and drank some coffee and put coffee back on the table in two seconds, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2694.2799999999997s)]
*  literally. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2700.6s)]
*  A guard was there, very gentle, soft, no terror. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2701.6s)]
*  I just said, please, sir, put the cover, plastic cover back on the coffee. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2704.12s)]
*  I asked afterwards. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2708.68s)]
*  I didn't want to cause problems there. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2709.68s)]
*  Why? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2712.56s)]
*  They told me you were sitting opposite Assange and evil men. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2713.56s)]
*  It was for my own good, they told me. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2717.14s)]
*  They wanted to block the possibility that evil men like Assange will grab the boiling [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2719.58s)]
*  coffee and throw it into my face and so on. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2726.04s)]
*  No, but I think, okay, these are my heroes. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2729.12s)]
*  You like alternate scenarios, right? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2732.02s)]
*  No, there is no alternate here. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2733.68s)]
*  Greta Thunberg exists. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2735.16s)]
*  What's the alternate scenario where you write books which are not so much pastiche, not [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2737.16s)]
*  so much bringing together of disparate elements, but you become a kind of realistic, non-Hegelian [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2743.52s)]
*  preacher, almost, like Greta Thunberg, return somewhat to your Catholic roots, embrace your [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2750.56s)]
*  right moderate side, retire in Singapore and go gallivanting off with me to the food stalls [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2756.48s)]
*  where we share your sense of humor with my right wing friend. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2764.52s)]
*  What does that alternate scenario look like? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2766.88s)]
*  First, I want to mention Singapore. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2768.88s)]
*  It's Ecuador. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2769.88s)]
*  It's too hot for me. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2770.88s)]
*  If I retire, if I retire, and I'm not lying to you now, two, three times I've written [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2771.88s)]
*  about it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2776.68s)]
*  I want to retire to the part of Norway which is not even Norway. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2777.68s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2781.4s)]
*  I wrote about it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2782.4s)]
*  It's my ideal place. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2783.4s)]
*  Longyearbyen, Svalbard Island. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2784.4s)]
*  That's my ideal place. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2785.4s)]
*  It's half empty, nothing there, and it's very good prospects for survival. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2786.4s)]
*  Because you know the joke, it's prohibited to die there. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2791.4s)]
*  But last question. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2798.4s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2799.4s)]
*  Quite seriously. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2800.4s)]
*  What's the other scenario where you evolve in this manner with your right wing sense [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2801.4s)]
*  of humor? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2804.6800000000003s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2805.6800000000003s)]
*  Why do you call it right wing? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2806.6800000000003s)]
*  It's the humor of my youth. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2807.6800000000003s)]
*  My God. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2809.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2810.1600000000003s)]
*  What has to happen for that scenario to come about? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2811.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying it will happen, but what does that science fiction world look like? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2813.6s)]
*  What would you have to say in the world? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2819.12s)]
*  I will tell you. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2820.12s)]
*  No, no, I'm not trying to make propaganda for myself. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2821.12s)]
*  But I did try to practice this. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2824.6s)]
*  One of my books which was not full failure but close to a failure, my rewriting of Antigone. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2828.04s)]
*  Did you read that? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2836.92s)]
*  No, I have not read that. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2837.92s)]
*  I love that one. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2838.92s)]
*  You know what I did? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2840.24s)]
*  I took, it's precisely alternate scenario. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2841.24s)]
*  I took, and you will not like the third version. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2844.08s)]
*  I took Antigone. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2846.44s)]
*  But you should like it because it's very pragmatic. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2847.84s)]
*  I took first, it's pure alternate logic like Kislovsky's film and that Lola runs and so [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2850.6000000000004s)]
*  on. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2858.88s)]
*  First I took the way the story you have in Sophocles, which incidentally is not the original [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2859.88s)]
*  story. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2865.76s)]
*  The original Greek myth is totally different. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2866.76s)]
*  Okay, you know what happens. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2868.7200000000003s)]
*  I will not repeat them. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2869.96s)]
*  of her big conflict in the middle of the play with Creon, I play alternate reality. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2872.44s)]
*  She wins. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2879.4s)]
*  Creon says, okay, you are right. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2880.4s)]
*  Let's allow the burial. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2882.92s)]
*  In my scenario, what happens is that as Creon suspected, there is again a revolt, again [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2884.48s)]
*  the traitor. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2891.8s)]
*  The whole of Thebes, the city is in ruin. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2892.8s)]
*  At the end of the second version, he walks desperate in the city and cries like the famous [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2896.8799999999997s)]
*  hit line of Antigone. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2905.48s)]
*  I was created for love, not for war. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2906.72s)]
*  And the chorus answers, fuck you, big, but that's what you created. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2910.64s)]
*  Then comes the third version. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2914.48s)]
*  Last word is for you, but you have 38 seconds. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2915.9199999999996s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2917.72s)]
*  The third version that you will like, I hope, is while Creon and Antigone are fighting, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2918.72s)]
*  the chorus steps over, said you are both traitors, ruining the city. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2925.4s)]
*  You should both be liquidated and they establish a kind of Jacobin terror and they are both [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2930.6800000000003s)]
*  liquidated. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2935.52s)]
*  Nobody likes this. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2936.52s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2937.52s)]
*  Lavoj, thank you very much. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2938.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2939.52s)]
*  But don't you suspect me, I still have zero seconds, but don't you suspect me, how come [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2946.12s)]
*  that you don't have, don't you trust me, that fear that now I'm talking soft, but if I get [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2952.08s)]
*  too close to power, you will see the style inside of me. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2957.28s)]
*  You don't suspect me of really being a bad guy. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2962.24s)]
*  You trust me. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2964.84s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2965.84s)]
*  I think your attachment and almost obsession with plenitude and being generative of ideas. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2966.84s)]
*  Yeah, ideas. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2973.04s)]
*  In the sense in which you are generative, which is a personality feature and a temperament [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2974.04s)]
*  and neurological in you, that that so overwhelms whatever oppressive tendencies you might have, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2979.68s)]
*  that if you were appointed dictator of whatever, you would just go off and write more books [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2986.48s)]
*  and you can't help it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2989.68s)]
*  And I admire this. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2992.44s)]
*  I will tell you a story, very brief one, don't be afraid, no time. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2993.44s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2997.96s)]
*  And even, I hope you will like this. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=2998.96s)]
*  My favorite passage in Marx is, maybe you know it, 1870 Paris Commune. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3001.24s)]
*  There was a dream that maybe there will be a European revolution. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3007.48s)]
*  And Marx wrote a letter to Engels. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3011.32s)]
*  I love him for that. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3013.8s)]
*  Where he says, oh my God, they want a revolution now, but I haven't yet finished the capital. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3015.2400000000002s)]
*  Not now. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3021.08s)]
*  I have to finish my book. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3022.08s)]
*  That's the true spirit. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3023.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3025.08s)]
*  And that's why I trust you. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3026.08s)]
*  Now, we have a method for questions. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3027.32s)]
*  There will be questions from the floor and questions from Twitter. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3029.04s)]
*  Your questions from the floor are to be questions, not statements, not proclamations, not political [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3031.88s)]
*  platforms. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3037.7200000000003s)]
*  We are here to hear this man, so I will cut you off if it is not a proper question. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3038.7200000000003s)]
*  But before we get to that, we have four questions on video, at least one of which is too long. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3044.1200000000003s)]
*  And I'm told they're your friends, but you need more enemies perhaps. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3049.44s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3052.76s)]
*  I'm sincere here. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3053.76s)]
*  But first we start with those questions. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3054.76s)]
*  Let's get to those. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3055.76s)]
*  But how will we do that? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3056.76s)]
*  And then questions here, then the microphones will come around and it will all be managed [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3057.76s)]
*  efficiently because this is Bergen, Norway. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3061.4s)]
*  Questions from the video. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3065.04s)]
*  My line of questioning for Slavoj has to do with the Marxist critique of political economy. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3066.2s)]
*  First in relation to Marxist historical materialism, do you think there have been any major changes [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3073.7599999999998s)]
*  in the basic relations between economic infrastructure and more than economic superstructure in capitalism [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3078.44s)]
*  between the mid-19th century and today? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3084.92s)]
*  Has the role or weight of the economy in shaping social history altered over this period? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3087.36s)]
*  Second, if you were to rewrite Marx's critical rendition of economics for the 21st century, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3092.8399999999997s)]
*  what components of it would you prioritize, updating, revising, scrapping or replacing? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3098.8799999999997s)]
*  What would be some of the distinctive features of your own contemporary critique of political economy? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3104.68s)]
*  They are all my friends. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3111.12s)]
*  I know who will be, so I will... [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3112.4s)]
*  On the other hand, these are difficult theoretical questions. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3114.72s)]
*  We need another two hours. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3117.3599999999997s)]
*  I would just say that, yes, I agree with... [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3118.96s)]
*  I cannot go into it now with Adrian's point how the relationship between ideology, economic [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3122.32s)]
*  infrastructure will change and so on and so on, but all I can do now is point out what [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3129.6s)]
*  he knows and most of us know that already in Marx, and that's one of the critical points [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3134.56s)]
*  that we need to read Marx, what I really admire in Marx, because it's not what you idiots, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3139.6800000000003s)]
*  not you personally, but think, it's his theory of commodity fetishism. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3145.4s)]
*  It's not simply we believe in fetishists. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3150.6s)]
*  No, Marx's theory is that we bourgeois subjects in our actual life, we are usually pragmatic [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3154.04s)]
*  Anglo-Saxon utilitarians. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3164.2000000000003s)]
*  The fetishist inversion is in how we act, our reality is structured. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3166.88s)]
*  Marx has a wonderful theory where it's not this enlightenment vision, you know, we dream [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3172.68s)]
*  illusions, the other thing is real life. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3178.12s)]
*  No, we can be very... [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3180.68s)]
*  To repeat a joke that I'm sure you all know, but it renders perfectly the point. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3181.8799999999997s)]
*  You know that story that I always repeat, Niels Bohr and the horseshoe. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3186.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, Niels Bohr had a horseshoe at his country house across the entrance door, superstitious [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3191.24s)]
*  item, and a friend asked me, why do you have it there? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3197.08s)]
*  Aren't you a scientist? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3199.72s)]
*  Do you believe in it? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3201.56s)]
*  You know what's Niels Bohr's answer. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3202.6s)]
*  Of course I don't believe in it, but I have it there because I was told that it works even [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3204.12s)]
*  if you don't believe in it. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3208.52s)]
*  That's how ideology works today. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3210.12s)]
*  At this level, the extent, and maybe you would agree with this, the lesson of Marx is that [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3212.6s)]
*  that's why interestingly enough commodity fetishism, he never calls it ideology, because [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3218.2799999999997s)]
*  it's something very strange. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3223.56s)]
*  It is a system of beliefs and so on, but objectifies central part of infrastructure itself. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3225.24s)]
*  Along those lines, I would say we have to go further than Marx and so on and so on. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3233.24s)]
*  I don't want to... [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3239.16s)]
*  Second video question, please. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3240.2s)]
*  My question's about communism. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3244.52s)]
*  So along with Alain Badu, you are one of the philosophers who reinvigorated the philosophical [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3247.0s)]
*  discussion of the idea of communism with a series of books and conferences and events. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3253.48s)]
*  So I'm wondering about your thinking about that project and the potential for communism now. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3260.28s)]
*  I'm also thinking about your editions of Collected Works of Lenin, different volumes that you've [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3265.88s)]
*  produced with Lenin's works, and some of your events, also your event with Jordan Peterson. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3273.96s)]
*  So my sense is that for the most part, you work within the communist tradition in addition [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3281.56s)]
*  to Hegel and Lacan, but yet sometimes it seems like your position is that every part of the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3289.7200000000003s)]
*  20th century experience has to be erased, has to be forgotten, has to be overcome, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3298.1200000000003s)]
*  that we go back to the beginning and we don't need to use anything that we learned in the 20th century. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3305.2400000000002s)]
*  At other times, it seems like you're precisely actually learning from the 20th century and using [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3310.68s)]
*  some of the writings of Lenin and the achievements and the examples from European history in the 20th [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3315.72s)]
*  century. So I'm hoping that you might clarify how you see the potential for communist politics today, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3321.0s)]
*  right? Not just communist philosophy, but communist politics today. What kind of organizational forms [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3327.64s)]
*  you think it requires and whether or not there really is a potential in communist movement. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3332.44s)]
*  Maybe another way to say this is how do you imagine the end of capitalism? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3338.04s)]
*  Again, another two hours answer question. What I would say is that [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3344.2799999999997s)]
*  look close, first I didn't, my God, I'm not crazy. I didn't edit collected works of Lenin. I haven't [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3349.88s)]
*  read them, never. What interested me is Lenin at a very precise moment. What fascinates me in Lenin, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3356.36s)]
*  and I said this in both of my introductions to some texts, that first Lenin's time is over. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3364.84s)]
*  I don't play the boring Trotsky game of, you know, this crazy dream. Oh, if only Lenin were [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3374.2000000000003s)]
*  to survive two years longer, he would have made it packed with Trotsky, Stalin would be sidestepped, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3381.08s)]
*  and so on. No, the deadlock was there from the beginning. So, but what interests me in Lenin, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3387.4s)]
*  and maybe that's what we need today, is this totally pragmatic, voluntarist spirit. Isn't it [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3393.64s)]
*  clear that in 1917 it was a total mess. Lenin often didn't know what to do. Some even liberal [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3400.92s)]
*  communists praised his state and revolution. But what he says there is something that he immediately [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3409.64s)]
*  abandoned then. What interests me is especially Lenin in 21, 22, and this was the big failure of [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3415.8s)]
*  the October Revolution. They won the civil war. And then it would have been my moment, okay, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3423.0800000000004s)]
*  now it's everyday life, invent new forms if you can. They failed. But Lenin was at least the one [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3428.84s)]
*  who, he said openly, our situation is totally desperate. We don't have any formula. He didn't [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3437.48s)]
*  have any trust in the future. He saw this total openness. That's what fascinates me, but I'm not [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3445.96s)]
*  preaching in any sense the return to it. So my idea, unfortunately, I'm here maybe a little bit more, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3453.48s)]
*  let's call it pessimist. I really think, and incidentally in this metaphor of [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3463.1600000000003s)]
*  returning to zero level, I quote Lenin who wrote in 21, 22, a wonderful text where he said [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3469.8s)]
*  nothing worked. Then he said it's not that we should stabilize our achievements, but we should [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3477.1600000000003s)]
*  return to the zero level, begin from nowhere. And quoting data which also you mentioned, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3484.04s)]
*  the horrible, the fact that the only livable communism today, communism in the formal sense, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3491.88s)]
*  the Chinese one, means ecological problems, more digital control, and so on and so on. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3498.76s)]
*  We have to begin in some sense from the zero. Lenin already did this not just as a good direction. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3505.0s)]
*  If you are a dogmatic Marxist, you can show that Lenin totally overturned Marx and so on. In this [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3512.04s)]
*  sense, Lenin was not the one of the fidelity to Marx. He pretended to be, but you know how [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3519.88s)]
*  religious revolutions also work. All great revolution proclaims itself return to origins. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3526.6s)]
*  Martin Luther, the greatest, oh we just want to return to the original Bible and so on. So [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3534.44s)]
*  no, I think again that with all objective study and so on, see the good, bad sides, but [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3540.76s)]
*  the 20th century communism was ultimately a failure, an absolute failure. Third video question, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3548.84s)]
*  please. Hi Slavoj, Paul Taylor here. Hope life's treating you well. My question relates to the role [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3556.44s)]
*  of academics as independent critical thinkers. In my experience within the UK sector at least, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3563.08s)]
*  academics over the years when confronted with growing bureaucracy, growing commercialism, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3570.92s)]
*  have behaved like lemming type creatures or quizlings, to use a couple of references [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3577.8799999999997s)]
*  you Norwegian audience will be familiar with. And given Brexit as a recent example, there's very [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3584.2799999999997s)]
*  little genuine debate over all the complicated topics around leaving the EU or not leaving as [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3592.04s)]
*  the case may be. And there's a level of conformity and group think that reminds me of the movie [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3598.68s)]
*  Stepford Wives if that rings a bell with you. So my question to you is you've experienced Yugoslav [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3605.64s)]
*  communist system and you've experienced something of the UK academic system. Which of those [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3613.48s)]
*  environments do you think is most conducive to genuine critical engaged intellectuals? Thanks. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3619.96s)]
*  Thanks. It's a very nice question and again you will accuse me of nostalgia, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3628.68s)]
*  but I would say in the last decade, 1980s, Yugoslavia was better. You know why? There was [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3633.96s)]
*  not yet a total economic fiasco and that was the beauty. From 1980 at least, maybe 82, the ruling [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3641.7999999999997s)]
*  nomenclatura were already preparing for the fiasco. So actually I think that some of the [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3650.12s)]
*  governments in different republics were pretty good. You know why? Because they knew they don't [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3656.68s)]
*  have democratic legitimacy. So they tried to learn some legitimacy. For example, a very sad story. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3662.2799999999997s)]
*  In mid-80s or six, seven, a gay organization formed itself in Slovenia. Immediately a delegate from [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3671.3199999999997s)]
*  central committee came there, yes you are progressive, we are for them, do you want financial support [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3681.24s)]
*  and so on and so on. Then we got democracy, 1990, the first thing that the city town council, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3686.28s)]
*  whatever dominated the conservatives, is abolish all have to this gay organization. So in some [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3693.2400000000002s)]
*  paradoxical sense, it was a golden era I would say, the second half, but I don't have any illusions. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3699.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not that communists were good or so, but communists in power knew they were fighting for [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3707.0800000000004s)]
*  survival. This is incidentally also how I read the explosion of nationalism. Milosevic got this. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3713.16s)]
*  Communist nomenclatura had a problem. Democracy is coming, how to regain some type of democratic [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3720.92s)]
*  legitimacy without cancelling themselves as nomenclatura. The answer obvious was, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3727.8799999999997s)]
*  stain yourself as a defender of national interest and so on, nationalism and so on. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3734.04s)]
*  On the other hand, I must say what makes me so depressive and the United States are big enough, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3740.28s)]
*  are not the worst, but especially UK, I don't know how it is here, is this pragmatic turn of [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3746.28s)]
*  philosophy has to serve concrete social needs. Labour party more than Techer began this in England. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3754.84s)]
*  My friend, philosopher are telling me you got Labour representative coming to university, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3764.0400000000004s)]
*  philosophy department, and say we will give you more money, but we will just make it if you get [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3769.4s)]
*  some money from private companies and so on and so on. But what I like about today's, I think, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3775.4s)]
*  this is certainly not a traditional leftist idea, that what's good about academia is precisely [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3783.32s)]
*  that it's a space with no concrete attachment to any needs of society. You can go crazy, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3790.44s)]
*  you can freely debate and so on and so on. And this is more and more difficult today, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3797.88s)]
*  even in Germany they are telling me. My good friend, conservative but bright, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3803.6400000000003s)]
*  Peter Sloterdijk, he told me to get more money, you know what he likes to do, business weekend. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3808.12s)]
*  Years ago he went for a weekend to Volkswagen top managers and explained them, you know, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3815.56s)]
*  this bullshit, what's going on today, post-modernity, the situation and so on. And God, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3822.36s)]
*  I didn't ask. So what I'm saying is that this reminds me in an uncanny way to the worst years [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3827.88s)]
*  in ex-Yugoslavia, 70s of the communist oppression. This focus on also human sciences has to work for [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3834.84s)]
*  society, experts solve problems. No, we don't need that today. We need precisely academia, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3844.52s)]
*  humanities in their useless character. Also in sciences, I think, if you look closely, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3853.7200000000003s)]
*  isn't it that practically all big inventions, as far as I can judge, emerged either in a totally [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3861.56s)]
*  contingent external way, usually some military contract or as a private hobby and so on. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3868.36s)]
*  So what I advise you if you are here at the university is don't believe in this mantra of [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3875.2400000000002s)]
*  you are here, bourgeois spending money, hard-earned workers money and so on, be more useful. No, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3882.2000000000003s)]
*  what's great about university is they are not useful in the immediate sense. That's what we [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3890.28s)]
*  should expect from you academics. All great things, again, to use the guy whom you mentioned [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3896.84s)]
*  this morning, John Elster. Yes. He has this wonderful term years ago of states which are [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3903.56s)]
*  necessary a byproduct. It just comes, you cannot plan it. Academia should be a place for this. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3911.0s)]
*  Last video question, please. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3918.76s)]
*  Hi, Savoy from Australia. You've often spoken critically of the Haldalin paradigm, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3920.28s)]
*  where the danger lies. There grows the saving power. The idea that disaster harbors the seeds [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3931.4s)]
*  of its own overcoming, catastrophe provides both the negative index and even the opportunity for [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3939.48s)]
*  redemption. It's a model of historical catastrophe or crisis that's often associated with a kind of [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3947.48s)]
*  dialectical salvage along pseudo-Hegelian lines. I'm saying pseudo-Hegelian because you've done so [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3954.52s)]
*  much to argue that Hegel himself resists this kind of negative eschatology, but you've often [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3961.48s)]
*  suggested that Marx calls prey to this way of thinking. One of your criticisms of this paradigm [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3969.32s)]
*  is that it exaggerates or misconstrues the exceptionality of the present [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3976.44s)]
*  and misunderstands the nature of the crisis and of crisis. Specifically, it underestimates the [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3983.64s)]
*  capacity of capitalism to absorb and feed on its own crises. Can we still hold to the idea of [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3990.52s)]
*  capitalism as being its own great figure? Can you elaborate your critique of the Haldalin paradigm [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=3997.64s)]
*  in the light of the present when we can see the danger, the ravaging effects of global capitalism [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4005.24s)]
*  all around us, to the extent that maybe danger itself is not the word we can use any longer, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4013.08s)]
*  and where previous models of crisis seem not to hold? Specifically, and here's my question, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4019.56s)]
*  is there a concept of revolution in the present context that does not fall prey to this paradigm? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4026.6s)]
*  Again, it's a mega difficult question. Just to explain to you, you know what, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4033.7999999999997s)]
*  see Rebecca Koume, incidentally, here I am a sincere, not politically correct feminist. I'm [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4039.08s)]
*  organizing next October New York Big Hegel Conference. The majority will be women, and I [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4046.68s)]
*  already brutally apologize to people. No, no, I'm not politically correct feminist. It's simply that [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4052.6s)]
*  the best Hegelian studies come from women today. So okay, so Haldalin paradigm, you know this [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4059.4s)]
*  passage from Haldalin, the general Rantic poem, all the time quoted by Hardinger, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4066.36s)]
*  vodas gefaris, vex das retten de aus, where the danger is the greatest, the point of salvation is [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4070.84s)]
*  also near and so on. And this is a model for the usual revolutionary thinking even in Marx. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4078.52s)]
*  Proletariat, zero level exploitation, poverty, but there is a chance that you turn around into [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4086.04s)]
*  salvation. I'm here a Hegelian, if you ask me. I much more believe, and I will not go into it now, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4093.0s)]
*  it's another half an hour, how do I apply this to what I was telling about catastrophes, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4100.4400000000005s)]
*  apocalypses, and so on. The post-apocalyptic vision. Hegel's problem is exactly the opposite one. The [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4106.28s)]
*  big attempt at liberation happened, French Revolution, and for Hegel, I don't totally [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4113.56s)]
*  agree with him, but nonetheless, it's turned wrong. Jacobin terror and so on. So what went wrong? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4119.400000000001s)]
*  Hegel is not a crazy optimist. As bad as things are, you should see a chance for the better. No, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4126.200000000001s)]
*  Hegel's basic insight is exactly the opposite one. No matter how good an idea or a project is, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4133.4800000000005s)]
*  we can be sure that it will turn wrong somehow. And I think what Hegel did to French Revolution [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4140.92s)]
*  was to do to 20th century communism. First, we have to still, we disagree here maybe, I still see [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4150.28s)]
*  some tremendous utopian emancipatory potential, but it went terribly wrong with Stalinism and so on. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4160.2s)]
*  And we shouldn't play these cheap games, just corrupt at Stalin or even, did you notice how [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4169.16s)]
*  Marxists are often even racist here? They put the blame on Russia is too close to Asia, so it's [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4175.8s)]
*  asian barbarism which is responsible for it. No, it seems went wrong and we have to begin [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4181.72s)]
*  thinking from this. What's then the solution? Simply return to more modest previous model of [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4189.96s)]
*  society. This is my vision today. Yes, we are approaching a crisis, but we cannot simply revitalize [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4196.92s)]
*  the 20th century communism. We should rethink it radically. I'm again a Hegelian pessimist here. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4206.04s)]
*  Hegel is for me a thinker of deep distrust. Hegelian dogma is everything turns wrong, so only [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4215.24s)]
*  this whole delicate Hegelian theory of repetition, only the second time to do it again. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4224.4400000000005s)]
*  You have to do it again, maybe you have a chance the second time if you learn the lessons of the [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4231.96s)]
*  first time. And I think that's what we need today. This much more modest spirit. Don't wait for a big [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4238.6s)]
*  revolution. It already happened and it screwed up. We now take questions from the floor. I will call [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4247.32s)]
*  on you and please wait for the mic. This way you can be captured on YouTube. I love you. You are deeply [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4254.84s)]
*  a good Stalinist. I am. Fuck democracy. You want order here. In the front here there's two people [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4260.28s)]
*  with hands up and we'll do them in sequence. I'm Jessie Tablete from the philosophy department here [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4267.719999999999s)]
*  at the University of Bergen. Now you came here today to tell us that you are still a communist. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4273.16s)]
*  That's not an affirmation, that's a reaffirmation. So my questions are two. The first is, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4280.92s)]
*  what has prompted this reaffirmation of your commitment to communism? And the second question [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4288.44s)]
*  is, has your commitment to communism evolved over the years and if so how? I think I implicitly, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4293.8s)]
*  maybe I failed, answered this in my whatever you call it bombastic word speech talk or whatever. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4300.44s)]
*  That it's simply the big dilemma is for me this one. It's still again as I said the Fukuyama [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4307.719999999999s)]
*  dilemma. We are confronting a series of problems today. Among them not only global migrations, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4314.5199999999995s)]
*  the new forms of domination based on digital universe ecology and so on and so on. Is the [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4322.599999999999s)]
*  existing liberal democratic capitalist system strong enough to cope with these problems or not? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4328.92s)]
*  And my answer is unfortunately no. I'm not saying now that this means anything go let's reinvent, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4338.68s)]
*  let's return to 20th century communism. I totally agree with you that all these problems reappeared [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4347.32s)]
*  only now we are discovering all the ecological catastrophes. Go to East Germany, whole areas are [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4357.08s)]
*  there totally contaminated. Go to parts of the Soviet Union which are even now prohibited and [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4363.88s)]
*  so on and so on. But to put it very simply, you know I was never naively pro-communist. My diploma [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4369.88s)]
*  work in this was early 70s, late 60s was rejected by university. This was still communist time as [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4378.839999999999s)]
*  not Marxist. This may surprise many of you but you know that I began as a Heideggerian. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4386.44s)]
*  My first book was on Heideggerian language in Slovene. No I don't like today. I would [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4393.4s)]
*  settle accounts with the book in Nazi style. Burn it you know. But what I'm saying is that [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4401.0s)]
*  this is to put it in very simplistic common sense terms. That's why I'm so distrustful about this [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4407.32s)]
*  usual liberal optimism. Like you know of course all my sympathy goes with for example refugees but [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4415.4s)]
*  don't turn it into a humanitarian problem. But not in this politically correct way you know. Western [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4422.839999999999s)]
*  people like to from developed countries like to blame themselves like yeah yeah whatever happens [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4428.36s)]
*  in third world it's colonialism we are guilty and so on. No we are not responsible because what one [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4434.2s)]
*  should never forget here I'm still I'm sorry to disappoint you staunchly pro-European enlightenment [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4441.24s)]
*  tradition. Even political correctness itself is I think a misdirected application of something that [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4448.599999999999s)]
*  is part of European tradition of enlightenment. You cannot even I think imagine something like [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4456.84s)]
*  political correctness outside the western tradition. So again so that I don't get lost. It's not that [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4462.44s)]
*  once I was a traditional authentic communist but I was very lucky in Yugoslavia you know why. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4470.76s)]
*  Because I don't have any illusions about ex-Yugoslavia. I'm not nostalgic but you know what was our luck. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4478.2s)]
*  From early 60s borders were maybe for literally 20 dissidents but other side were completely open. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4484.6s)]
*  As a student late 60s I was going once at least every two months is not more often by train to [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4493.8s)]
*  London Paris or Munich to buy books and so on. So for us in ex-Yugoslavia the end of communism was [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4501.639999999999s)]
*  not this traumatic experience oh my god now we know what it is. No we were there all the time [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4510.28s)]
*  going to the west no illusions and maybe this was my luck that I had no illusions about [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4516.68s)]
*  Yugoslav communism. I didn't buy the stupidity of some western communist. Yugoslavia is different. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4524.68s)]
*  It was an authentic democratic communism but borders were open so I also didn't have great [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4531.4800000000005s)]
*  illusions about the west and it goes to my honor check it up it appeared in 88-89 in New Left Review [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4538.36s)]
*  a short text of mine the East European Republic of Gilead reference to Margaret Edward's Handmaid's [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4548.12s)]
*  Tale where it was clear to me that I predicted there explicitly that East European post-communism [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4555.799999999999s)]
*  will take this nationalist fundamentalist turn and so on and so on. So again it's not that I ever was a [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4565.32s)]
*  traditional Marxist because you know what was my formative experience I remember when I was [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4574.599999999999s)]
*  young student the big conflict in Slovenia was between Marxist Frankfurt school and Hedegarian's [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4581.0s)]
*  Hedegarian's more dissidents Frankfurt school official Marxist then the big French wave exploded [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4588.68s)]
*  so-called structuralism post-structuralism and both sides dissidents and the party officials [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4597.56s)]
*  used the same language attacking it that's what made my identity through the French experience [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4605.240000000001s)]
*  but I'm sorry if I disappointed you but again my point is this one simply that we are approaching [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4611.08s)]
*  problems catastrophic potentials and it will not be able to deal with it within the liberal democratic [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4621.0s)]
*  capitalist system that's my foundation very simple one yes directly in front of her then in the front [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4632.92s)]
*  row over here and we'll need to compress the answers a bit to get through I'm sorry I'm very [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4639.88s)]
*  sorry yes I will I will go into my Buddhist mode you know this bullshit like clap with one hand [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4644.12s)]
*  listen to my silence or whatever please sorry um so I think we can agree with that the idea of a [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4649.8s)]
*  stateless communist society is kind of stupid so could we apply the idiot king in our community [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4658.2s)]
*  the idiot king sorry idiot king right yeah who is this okay no no like like [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4666.92s)]
*  you talked about this in like theocracies where it becomes tyranny when the expert gets in charge [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4675.4800000000005s)]
*  that's the worst yes yes that's the worst I agree with that so we need like an idiot king to be on [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4682.12s)]
*  the top so the expert can make the decisions under him could that solution be in a communist society [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4687.88s)]
*  and what but it's up to a point yes very good question I would refer here to my Japanese friend [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4694.6s)]
*  very intelligent read him his books are translated most of into English Codin Caratani [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4701.08s)]
*  and he okay it's provocative what but he said the passage from bourgeois to proletarian democracy [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4708.200000000001s)]
*  I quote him is the passage from voting to lottery you know that there must be a dimension of [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4717.0s)]
*  lottery chance and so on to prevent expert rule and so on so I believe that in every [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QWRFK8GQ8&t=4725.0s)]
