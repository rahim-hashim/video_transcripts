# Tom Holland on History, Christianity, and the Value of the Countryside  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [March 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLmVCa3zDeI)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm honored to be chatting with Tom Holland.
*  I'm a huge fan of Tom.
*  He is a historian, a public intellectual and author.
*  He has numerous books including Millennium, Persian Fire, Dynasty, Books on Islam.
*  His latest is Dominion, How the Christian Revolution Remade the World, which I am a
*  big fan of.
*  He does with Dominic Sandbrook, one of the best known, perhaps the best known history
*  podcast called The Rest is History.
*  He is frequently on radio and television, has performed what is the greatest translation
*  of Herodotus ever.
*  He is a huge cricket fan and he is fighting to save the hedgehog in England.
*  Tom, welcome.
*  Thank you very much and I'm sure the mention of cricket will induce furrowed brows across
*  America.
*  In what way is your interpret of Christianity still influenced by Lord Byron, a writer
*  you started your career working on?
*  That's a very, very good question because I've never thought of the conjunction, although
*  now you mention it.
*  So I was raised by my mother as in the Church of England.
*  She is a regular churchgoer and so I went to church with her and so that was very much
*  part of my upbringing.
*  But at the same time, my mother's elder brother, my uncle David, he was an extraordinary man
*  who had, during the Second World War, he'd been posted as a very young man out to India.
*  He'd fallen in love with India.
*  Throughout the 50s, he worked as a publisher in Pakistan and then while he was out there,
*  he decided that actually he wanted to be an actor.
*  So he came back to England.
*  He got a role in Doctor Who as a homicidal Tibetan monk and so he was not a churchgoer,
*  it would be fair to say.
*  And he took me to Newstead Abbey as a very impressionable boy.
*  And Newstead Abbey is the home of Lord Byron and it was an abbey that had been closed down
*  in the Reformation, bought by the Byrons.
*  The Byrons had fought on the side of the king in the Civil War, had been kind of admirals
*  and ne'er-do-wells and Byron inherited this title.
*  And I went to this abbey and was told stories about how Byron and his friends would dress
*  up as monks and Byron had a drinking cup made out of a skull and he and all the lads would
*  do very ungodly things.
*  And this seemed to me the height of glamour and sophistication.
*  And to my innocent churchgoing self, Byron became a kind of model of swagger and glamour
*  as he was for people throughout the 19th century and for many people still is.
*  And so I became fascinated by Byron and he became, I initially wanted to do a doctorate
*  on him but then I gave that up because I decided that he was just too fascinating, too charismatic
*  and too, basically too hostile to the academic, I think, that he didn't deserve an academic
*  treatment.
*  And so instead I wrote a novel in which he was a vampire.
*  And so that set me on the course of writing.
*  So I wrote three novels in which various periods of history in which famous people from history
*  were vampires.
*  And I began to realize I wasn't really interested in writing novels.
*  I wasn't ultimately interested in writing vampire stories.
*  I wanted to write about history.
*  But the link, I think, with Christianity is that what interested me in writing about the
*  vampire novels and what has interested me in writing all the various volumes of history
*  in various periods of time that I've done since is a fascination with how people in
*  different ages understood things that to us today might seem far-fetched, implausible,
*  impossible.
*  So essentially how they relate to the dimension of the supernatural.
*  And I think it's a real problem for anyone in the 21st century trying to understand the
*  past is that perhaps too academic approach to the study of what, say, people in Rome
*  or early medieval Europe or whatever thought about the divine is that it's a bit like
*  studying a butterfly by sticking a pin through it.
*  And too objective, too academic, too rationalist an approach can risk alienating you from the
*  very perspectives that you're trying to understand.
*  And I think that that was something I realize now from the distance of time from when I
*  was writing the vampire books.
*  That is that's what I was kind of exploring in those books and have continued to explore,
*  I think.
*  And do you feel the power and influence of Catholicism more strongly because you're
*  still a Byronite still thinking about vampires?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  I found when I came to writing about Christianity and dominion is a study of the entire sweep
*  of Christianity.
*  It's kind of insanely ambitious book that it was a kind of privilege for me to immerse
*  myself in all these different periods and read the great Christian writers and thinkers
*  and polemicists of different periods.
*  And I found that I was fascinated in almost all of them.
*  And there was very rarely a chapter that I wrote where I didn't think I wish I could
*  stay here and continue to read about it.
*  And absolutely writing about the medieval church, I found I did find it very, very powerful.
*  But equally getting to the Reformation, I felt the power of the Protestant reformers
*  as well.
*  And actually, we're recording this in what in London is the afternoon.
*  This morning, I spent recording three episodes of The Rest is History on what's erroneously
*  called the Cathars, but were the objects of perhaps the most brutal and bloody of all
*  the crusades waged not against Muslim enemies, but against Christians themselves in the 13th
*  century.
*  And I think it's difficult in that context to look at the Catholic Church of the Middle
*  Ages as wholly a benign institution.
*  If the Book of Revelation were more important in Christian thought, would we as a society
*  all be less liberal?
*  It doesn't read like a liberal book, right?
*  No, it isn't.
*  If you look at Jehovah's Witnesses who put a lot of stress on Revelation, they seem less
*  classically liberal.
*  The thing about the Book of Revelation is that it was recognized by Christians themselves in
*  antiquity as a highly dangerous book.
*  So it wasn't included in the canon of the New Testament in the Orthodox Church, so in
*  the realms of the Byzantine Empire until the 10th century.
*  They were nervous of it.
*  And although it was included in the canon of the New Testament in the Latin Church much earlier,
*  again, you look at the Church Fathers in the Latin Church and again, they're very, very nervous of
*  it.
*  And the archetypal, the greatest of the Latin Church Fathers, Saint Augustine, writing in the
*  late 4th and early 5th century, he is very, very anxious that Christians might read the Book of
*  Revelation and interpret it too literally.
*  And so there's talk about a thousand years in the Book of Revelation as a key span of time.
*  And Augustine is absolutely definite that this is to be seen as a kind of abstraction.
*  And so when the first millennium arrives, the year 1000,
*  the Church is not encouraging people to feel kind of apocalyptic anxieties, but I think they
*  indisputably do.
*  And I think actually, ironically, the fact that the Church emerges from this millennial period
*  and that Christ hasn't come or the reign of Antichrist hasn't come, the horrors and the
*  extraordinary wars and plagues and terrors that were seen by John in the Book of Revelation have
*  not been manifested, opens up for reformers in the 11th century to an idea that
*  the Christian people can be cleansed, can be reformed, can be brought closer to God
*  and that precipitates what I think is the first great revolutionary
*  moment in European and therefore Western history, what's called the Papal Revolution.
*  And it's that revolution, I think, that stands at the fountainhead of the entire revolutionary
*  tradition of which we in the 21st century are still heirs.
*  And I think that, you know, liberalism, all kinds of things would not have been possible
*  without that revolutionary moment.
*  And so perhaps to that extent, without the Book of Revelation, maybe the Papal Revolution
*  wouldn't have been launched and maybe we wouldn't be where we are today.
*  Which gospel do you view is most foundational for Western liberalism and why?
*  I think that that is a treacherous question to ask because it implies that there would be
*  a coherent line of descent from any one text that can be traced like that.
*  I think that the line of descent that leads from the Gospels and from the New Testament
*  and from the Bible and indeed from the entire corpus of early Christian texts to modern
*  liberalism is too confused, too much of a swirl of influences for us to trace it back to a particular
*  text. If I had to choose any one book from the Bible, it wouldn't be a gospel.
*  It would probably be Paul's letter to the Galatians because Paul's letter to the Galatians
*  contains the famous verse that there is no Jew or Greek, there is no slave or free,
*  there is no man or woman in Christ. And in a way, that text, even if you kind of bracket out and
*  remove the in Christ from it, that idea that there should be no discrimination between people of
*  different cultural and ethnic backgrounds based on gender, based on class, remains pretty
*  foundational for liberalism to this day. And I think that liberalism in so many ways is a kind of
*  secularized rendering of that extraordinary verse. But I think it's almost impossible to avoid
*  metaphor when thinking about what the relationship is to these biblical texts, these biblical verses
*  to the present day. And I variously compared Paul in particular in his letters and his writings
*  to rather unoriginally to an acorn from which a mighty oak grows. But I think more actually,
*  more appropriately to a depth charge released beneath the vast fabric of classical civilization
*  and the ripples, the reverberations of it are faint to begin with, and then they become louder
*  and louder and more and more disruptive. And those echoes from that depth charge continue to
*  reverberate to this day. As you know, there's the Jacob Taubas view that Paul is more anti-Roman
*  and in some ways more anti-statist than Jesus revising Jesus politically. What is your take
*  on that debate? How is Paul revising Jesus politically? Well, I think I think that Jesus
*  is very radically anti-state and by state, I mean specifically the notion that both in Jerusalem and
*  in Rome, power is interfused with those who claim a mandate to interpret the divine. So that this is
*  clearly the case in the Jerusalem temple. The gospel writers and, you know, we don't know
*  that the sayings of Jesus are mediated through the gospel writers and the degree to which they
*  correspond to what a historical Jesus might have said is obviously hugely contested.
*  But insofar as we have a record of what the historical Jesus might have said in the gospels,
*  he seems hostile to the Jerusalem temple authorities. And I think that what he is
*  hostile to is summed up in that the attempt to the attack on the money changes and the idea that
*  in some way what is God's can be implicated in the churn of the earthly. And I think he also
*  feels that about Rome, that the Romans also, you know, it's often cast today that the Jews
*  are religious and by Jesus going before Pontius Pilate is somehow being handed over to the
*  secular authorities. But the Romans are no less secular than the Judean authorities. The Romans,
*  too, are absolutely implicated in the sense that their power is interfused with an understanding
*  of the divine. Pontius Pilate's main base is in the city of Caesarea, which is named after Caesar
*  Augustus, and Augustus is a god. And the Romans also, like the Jews, have a great temple in their
*  city, the Capitoline temple, the temple of Capitoline Jupiter, which ironically will be
*  incinerated a few months before the Jerusalem temple is incinerated by the Romans in AD 70.
*  And I think that Jesus in that kind of incredibly potent episode where
*  people come up to him and they say, should we be paying taxes to the Romans? And Jesus asks for a
*  coin and he is given a coin and he says, whose head is on this? And the people who are talking
*  to him say, the head of Caesar. And Jesus famously says, will render unto Caesar what is Caesar's
*  and render unto God what is God's. That is, again, another of these depth charges, another of these
*  acorns from which mighty oaks will grow. Because it's there that you get the idea actually in the
*  long run of there being kind of something that is secular. Jesus, I think, is all about separating
*  the divine from the earthly. And that is an incredibly potent insight. And it's one that is
*  as hostile to the claims of Caesar as to the claims of the temple authorities. And I think
*  Paul is completely the heir of that. And I think Paul understands that. And there's a huge sense
*  there's a huge sense in which his letters, his understanding of Jesus, the way that he portrays
*  that serves as a kind of parody of the cult of Augustus. So I mentioned the letter to the
*  Galatians. Galatia is one of the great centers of the cult of Augustus. And so I think that when
*  Paul is writing to the Galatians, he is very conscious that the God that he is talking about
*  exists in the context of a world in which the fastest growing cult is the cult of Caesar.
*  How do you view the Christian foundations of African American liberalism as being different?
*  Well, I hesitate as an Englishman to kind of in any way pontificate about American history,
*  but with that caveat, I will. But you punch in the role in history, Islamic history, right?
*  Okay, Eric is a pretty close cousin. So my feeling about this is that the civil rights movement
*  is one of a succession of great awakenings in American Protestantism and indeed in Anglo-American
*  Protestantism. So let that be my sanction for talking about this.
*  This idea that reverberates throughout Anglo-American history that people need to
*  be awakened to a sense of their sin and therefore to a sense of the potential for salvation.
*  African Americans are the heirs of that as well. They inherit the Protestantism and often the
*  evangelical Protestantism of the white Americans. And the figure of Martin Luther King is emblematic
*  of that. He is the reverend Martin Luther. And he is the reverend of the white American
*  Protestantism. He is absolutely situated in the tradition of radical Protestantism,
*  which the Baptists are kind of, you know, he's a Baptist minister. He is heir to these traditions
*  that go back to the 17th century and the 16th century and perspectives that are often incredibly
*  radical. And the more radical fringe of Protestants, and these are Protestants who often emigrate from
*  England to the New World because their understanding of what the Bible teaches is seen as being
*  too radical, too hot to handle back in England. And they bring with them this notion that
*  the Bible can only be understood if mediated by the Spirit. So it's not what the Bible says
*  in black and white. It's what the Spirit makes you understand. And it's this in due course that
*  enables Quakers and evangelicals, for instance, to argue that slavery as an institution is evil,
*  even though notoriously and nowhere in the Bible is that ever said. For evangelicals, for Quakers,
*  for radical Protestants, that's an irrelevance. The Spirit has descended on them and it has enabled
*  them to understand that. That sense combines with the incredible power of the Exodus story,
*  the idea that people who've been in bondage can be brought out of slavery and can be brought to a
*  new world, a new land. That is what kind of powers the Pilgrim Fathers and other emigrants from
*  England. And in due course, it's what powers people as they move from the East Coast across America.
*  And of course, it has an incredibly potent influence on African Americans during the period
*  of their servitude and in the wake after it. And the failure of reconstruction, the fact that
*  particularly in the South, there remains so much institutional oppression, so much institutional
*  racism, means that in the 50s and the 60s, when there are campaigns starting to develop calling
*  for civil rights, calling for the rejection of repressive laws in the South, this inheritance is
*  an obvious one to draw on. And that's why Martin Luther King is such a potent spokesman for it,
*  because when he tells white American Christians that black American Christians are their brothers
*  and sisters, he is going with the grain of everything that American Protestantism,
*  radical Protestantism has been about since the very beginning. And he can articulate the
*  power of the Exodus story and the power of scripture as mediated by people upon whom the
*  spirit has descended. And he can do so in a way that reverberates beyond the black churches into
*  the white churches and secularized throughout the 60s. It's this great movement, I think, that,
*  you know, like the spirit blowing in the wind, as it were, animates not just the civil rights
*  movement, but all kinds of other movements as well. So in due course, movements that may seem very
*  opposed to doctrinal Christianity, feminism, gay rights, and so on. So I think that it's,
*  the civil rights movement is incomprehensible without that heritage. It's absolutely animated
*  by it. In Genesis and Exodus, why does the elder son so frequently catch it hard?
*  Well, I'm an elder son. I know your brother's younger and he's a his brother. My brother is
*  younger. And it's a question on which I've often pondered, because I would go to church.
*  And what do you expect from your brother? And the truth is, I have no idea. I don't know. I've
*  often kind of worried about it. So you mentioned Byron at the beginning of the show. And Byron
*  wrote a play called Cain. And Cain, of course, is the first elder son. And he kills his younger
*  brother. And the mark of Cain is laid upon him and he becomes a great wanderer. And in Byron's play,
*  Cain becomes the representative of a free thinker, someone who dares to defy the tyrannical almighty.
*  And Satan, who appears to him, is very much in the tradition of Milton's Satan,
*  as understood by the Romantic poets. Satan is someone who is saying that actually
*  knowledge is found by defying God. And I think because I was the elder son, that's another
*  reason why I found Byron's poetry when I was in my teens, so powerful and so effective. And it's
*  part of what led me away from Christian belief, really. A kind of feeling that
*  all the cool kids were hanging out with Cain, and especially all the cool elder sons.
*  In the Book of Exodus, why do there seem to be two versions of the Ten Commandments, at 20
*  and then at 34? The first being more legalistic, the second being more ritualistic. Why are there
*  two? How do they fit together? Well, I think this reflects the way in which what we call today the
*  Bible is, it's an accretion of texts. You know, there often seem to be two versions of stories
*  stitched together. There are two versions of the creation of mankind, for instance. Very obviously,
*  you know, you have the Book of Kings and you have the Book of Chronicles. They're essentially
*  telling the same stories and kind of duplicating each other. And I think that the construction of
*  what comes to be called the Pentateuch, the first five, the Torah, the first five books of the Bible,
*  because they're so foundational, because they're so kind of important doctrinally to a sense of
*  of Jews and Christian sense of themselves.
*  They were the most rewritten and the most contested.
*  And the idea that you get in the Quran very obviously, that this is literally the word of
*  God. It's not being mediated by humans. With the Ten Commandments, you get that as well.
*  This isn't being mediated by Isaiah or Saint Matthew or whoever.
*  But by Moses, right? The Israelites don't get to look on the face of God.
*  Right. But Moses is bringing the tablets down and those have been written by God.
*  Well, Moses claims.
*  Sure. Sure. I mean, if you want to go that reductive, then Moses clearly almost certainly
*  didn't exist. I mean, he seems the most ahistorical figure. But the claim is, and it's clearly believed
*  by the people who are writing these texts or constructing them or stitching them together
*  to form what today we think of as those books. For them, this is something awesome and holy,
*  as the Quran is for Muslims. It's something that you approach with extreme care, extreme
*  nervousness. To tamper with the word of God is to tamper with God. And you don't want to do that,
*  because the Bible is full of examples of what happens to people who do that. In a way,
*  it's the molten heart of what Christians call the Old Testament. It's literally the word of God.
*  Are there religious reasons why America is more pro-technology than Europe?
*  That's a very good question. I think there are generally religious reasons for almost everything
*  in America. But I suspect that it's more to do with the fact that it is easy to bring home
*  improvements into a house that's just been built than it is to do home improvements in a house
*  that's 500 years old. European states, if you imagine them as kind of houses, they're very old.
*  They have all kinds of dodgy wiring, bodge jobs. And everyone knows that the worst kind of DIY is
*  when you yourself have bodged it over many, many years. It makes it much harder to do. It's much
*  easier just to kind of rip everything out and put it back in again. And I think that that is the
*  kind of attitude that people in America tend to have. I mean, I don't know. I have no stats on
*  this. But I would guess that it would be easier to import wholesale technology into a house
*  on the outskirts of Houston than it would be in downtown Manhattan.
*  Or an English country home.
*  Absolutely. But one of the things that always strikes me when I go to New York is actually,
*  it's an old city. In Europe, we're accustomed to thinking of America as modern and new. But New
*  York is not a modern city. Boston, not modern cities. And I think that there, I remember going
*  to Boston, I'd go for, I don't know, maybe over 10 years. And every time I'd go, there'd be this
*  massive great hole in the middle of Boston. And they were kind of trying, I think, trying to develop
*  a subway system. And every time I go, it got bigger.
*  I call it the big dig.
*  The big dig. And a big dig, I would guess, is much easier to do in a kind of, you know, I don't know,
*  Vegas or Houston than in Boston, because Boston is just a very old city in exactly the way that
*  Manchester is in Britain or Lyon or somewhere. I mean, they're not quite as old as Lyon, but
*  it is always easier to develop technology, I think, in areas where you don't have stuff already
*  there. And that's one of the reasons why over the course of the 19th century, you know, the industrial
*  lead moves from Britain to America and to Germany. There are doubtless all kinds of sociological
*  reasons that I'm not qualified to opine about. But one of the reasons must be that Britain enters the
*  industrial revolution first. And so it's, you know, it's industrial infrastructure,
*  by definition, is older than that that comes to be developed by the Americans or say the Germans.
*  Are you yourself ultimately a gnostic?
*  I'm not a gnostic in any way.
*  In any way at all?
*  No, I'm not a gnostic in any way.
*  What is your implicit theology?
*  So I remember going to San Francisco. She wasn't my wife then. She became my wife. She got a one-year
*  place at Stanford. And I was very, very upset about this, that she'd gone. And so I went out,
*  and it was my first time to America, went to San Francisco. I'm so excited to go to San Francisco,
*  because for me, it was the kind of the city of flower power and hippies and everything. And so
*  I went to Haight Ashbury and just kind of went toward all the hippie bookshops and got a whole
*  load of books on the gnostics there and kind of read them up. And I was very into all that kind
*  of stuff. But I now absolutely repudiate that. I think, I don't think that the gnostics were
*  somehow were hippies, were in any way progressive. I think that they were kind of deep, dark pessimists.
*  And what I like in Christianity actually is the message of hope that it offers, the message of
*  salvation, and the message that matter is not evil, that our human bodies and the world around us
*  are not creations of some malign demiurge, but are created by God and therefore are good. I
*  find that a much more positive message than the kind of gnosticism that I found so appealing when
*  I was 21 and, you know, very much in the throes of love, which may have confused and blurred my
*  thought patterns. What did you learn about modernity by translating Herodotus, which I believe was one
*  page a day? No, it wasn't one page a day. So the books of Herodotus, there are nine books and each
*  book is divided up into chapters. And this happened in antiquity. And so I would set myself the
*  challenge of translating one of those kind of chunks every day, because otherwise I don't think
*  I would ever have finished it. What I learned about modernity from Herodotus is that I think
*  the quality about Herodotus that I have always loved, he's always been
*  my favorite writer, not just my favorite ancient writer, but my favorite writer. He's the first
*  classic writer I read. I've reread him. I've kind of reinterpreted him. I've translated him.
*  And I realized as I was writing it, what I loved was the infinite curiosity that he has about
*  everything. So his writings are called hysteria, which in Greek basically means researches,
*  inquiries. It doesn't mean history in the sense that we have. And he's not just writing, you know,
*  he is writing about the past. He says that this is his aim, but he's not exclusively writing about
*  the past. He's writing about wild animals. He's writing about rivers. He's writing about wonders
*  in different lands. He's writing about how Egyptian men squat to go to the toilet and Egyptian
*  women stand up and how Scythians get stoned on bongs and all kinds of extraordinary, mad,
*  weird, fascinating stuff. And he was called in antiquity the father of lies because there
*  were lots of people who felt that this was, you know, he was just making it all up.
*  I think that's incredibly harsh. Often many of the things that he was doubted for, he's been
*  vindicated. And I think that it brings what I found. I was translating Herodotus,
*  and I was able to use the internet as I was doing it. If there was kind of subjects, you know,
*  a name or something, I wouldn't have to go to a book to look it up. I could look it up online.
*  And I realized it brought home to me how arrogant it is for us to sit in judgment on him when he
*  was the first person to be doing this. He was the first person to be pursuing the infinite
*  curiosity he felt about the vast expanse of everything to its absolute limits. And so,
*  of course, he got things wrong. You know, we would. He didn't have the internet. He didn't have an
*  example of Herodotus. Herodotus didn't exist. There was no Herodotus before Herodotus. He's
*  doing it for the first time. But I think that the sense of curiosity that the modern world is all
*  about, we have access to more knowledge than is beyond the wildest dreams of previous generations,
*  and we can follow it wherever we want. And Herodotus, for me, stands at the head of that
*  tradition, the head of that fascination with the vastness, the infinitude of the world and the
*  universe that we inhabit. And I look at modernity, and Herodotus sharpens for me
*  a sense of how extraordinary and wonderful it is that we can know everything that we do and that
*  we have access to all the sources of information that we have. And it's a wonderful, wonderful
*  thing, an incredible privilege of being alive in 2023. Are we likely to learn much more about
*  the Persian Empire? And if so, how will that happen? Would it be archaeology? Some other
*  techniques? Yeah, so. So, we know a lot about Greece, because Herodotus was Greek, and he writes
*  about the Persian Wars. And so inevitably, we see the world through Greek eyes, because Herodotus
*  was Greek. However, one of the wonderful things about Herodotus, one of the many wonderful things,
*  is that he does try to see the world through Persian eyes. And so he tells a remarkable story
*  that I just think is astonishing. So he imagines
*  Darius the Great, who's the Persian king who sends the expedition to Marathon, that gets defeated
*  at Marathon, so a great enemy of the Athenians. And Herodotus imagines himself in Darius's high
*  heeled shoes, the high heeled boots that the Persian kings are said to have worn. And Darius
*  summons Greeks and an Indian tribe. And these are the two people who exist on the western and eastern
*  margins of his empire, respectively. And he says to the Greeks, what would it take me to do?
*  You know, what would I have to pay you to persuade you to eat your parents once they've died?
*  And the Greeks who burn their parents when they've died throw their hands up in horror and say that,
*  nothing, we would never do that. And then Darius turns to the Indian tribe, and these are a people
*  who eat their parents when they've died as a mark of their utmost respect. And Darius says to them,
*  what would I have to do to persuade you to burn your parents when they're dead? And likewise,
*  the Indian tribesmen throw their hands up in horror. And Herodotus says, this shows to me
*  that custom is king, you know, that everybody believes that their own customs are best.
*  And he understands that. He understands that. He gets that. And so when he's writing about the
*  Persians, he is trying to do his best to kind of portray them as they see themselves and not just
*  to kind of do them down. Now, of course, he doesn't, you know, it doesn't work. And the problem
*  with the Persians is that we don't have a Persian Herodotus, nor do we have indeed a Persian Isaiah,
*  the Jews also write about the Persians. And so our sense of the Persians has been mediated
*  through the Bible and through the Greek historians hugely. What's happened over the past few decades,
*  however, is that scholars have basically teamed up to try and go beyond that, to try and go beyond
*  the kind of the fact that we lack Persian accounts to try and see beyond what the Greeks and the Jews
*  wrote. And this has required basically pooling every conceivable source of information that we
*  have. So such Persian inscriptions as we do have, archaeology, the insights of areas of the Persian
*  Empire that perhaps hadn't previously been tapped, be that Egypt or Babylonia, wherever,
*  where there again, there are sources, trying to put the Persian Empire as it functioned in the
*  sixth, the fifth, the fourth centuries BC into some kind of understanding that is true to the
*  functioning of the empire in that period, rather than say, you know, sources that were written much
*  later. And this is a really, really difficult, challenging, complicated process. And it's been
*  one of the great feats of the field of ancient history, that all these scholars have, I think,
*  achieved that they have kind of to a degree, performed an act of resurrectionism, they have
*  brought us to an understanding of the Persian Empire that is better than anyone's had since
*  the collapse of the Empire itself. And so we, yeah, sorry.
*  No, is it possible the Persians might have had a philosophical tradition that was advanced in the
*  manner that the Greeks were? Maybe not quite as splendid. But if we ruled that out, it might
*  simply be lost. They completely did. And it was one of the most influential intellectual spiritual
*  traditions that's ever existed. Because I'm reluctant to call it Zoroastrianism. It comes
*  to be institutionalized as what today we might call Zoroastrianism in the third, the fourth,
*  the fifth centuries AD, under a new Persian Empire, the empire that's governed by a family called
*  the Sasanians. But the Sasanian kings who are institutionalizing
*  Zoroastrianism rather in the way that Constantine institutionalizes Christianity in the
*  Roman Empire, they are clearly drawing on traditions that were very, very current in the
*  earliest Persian Empire, the Achaemenid Empire. And these traditions are essentially dualist.
*  It's the idea that the world can be moralized, that it can be understood as being divided between
*  rival spheres of good and evil, of light and dark, of truth and the lie. And this is what's so
*  influential about the Persian Empire, is that they moralize their own imperialism. And this is hugely
*  influential because when the Persian king, so Darius would be the person who most potently
*  expresses this, he says that he is the chosen one of Ahura Mazda, the great god, the good lord,
*  and that truth and order are embodied in Ahura Mazda and that Darius as his deputy, therefore
*  the realm that he rules also is the dimension of truth and order. And the corollary of that is that
*  those who oppose Darius are agents of the lie and of anarchy, and therefore they must be crushed
*  not just as enemies of the Persian king, but as enemies of what is good. And when Xerxes leads his
*  campaign against the rebellious cities of Athens and Sparta, he is doing this not just to expand
*  his empire, but because he sees it, Athens and Sparta are terrorist states. They are states in
*  which demons have laid siege to the Acropolis and to the temples of Sparta and taken possession of
*  it, and so therefore they must be smoked out. And I wrote about this in Persian Fire, my book about
*  the Persian Wars, and I was writing against the backdrop of the NATO attempt to stabilize Afghanistan,
*  which from the view of the West was a remote and mountainous backwater occupied by terrorists,
*  and I realized that basically that's how the Persians saw the Greeks, and we in the West have
*  the conceit that we are the heirs of Athens, but we are at least as much the heirs of the Persian
*  kings as we are of the Athenians. And that idea that power can be moralized, it passes into the
*  bloodstream not just of Zoroastrianism and the Zoroastrianism of the Sasanian Empire,
*  but the Christian Empire of Constantine, the Muslim Caliphate, and has absolutely passed into
*  the present. We are in that sense completely the heirs of the Achaemenid Empire. The ancient
*  Greeks and Persians, how technologically advanced do you think they were and how much do we know
*  about that? So I'm sure you're familiar with finding astronomical computing devices, you know,
*  from the ancient Greeks. We don't quite understand what all these things did. Is it possible they
*  were much more advanced than we realize? I would in no way claim to be a specialist in the history
*  of ancient technology. I think the hugely interesting question is basically not how
*  advanced were, say, the Greeks or the Romans, but why did they not industrialize? So moving on from
*  the Greeks or the Persians and looking at the Roman Empire in the second century AD,
*  this was an incredibly economically advanced society. It was,
*  it had a vast internal market. It was starting to create, it was starting to recognize that the
*  scale of the market enabled people to become richer and richer, that more and more resources
*  could be brought together. It's been estimated that people in the Roman Empire in the second century AD
*  were probably, no society was as rich until, say, the Netherlands, the Dutch Republic
*  in the late 16th, early 17th century. So it's a very, very successful, economically successful,
*  prosperous society. And, you know, there are brilliant people who are developing all kinds
*  of things, but there does also seem to be, on the part of the Roman elites, and this is true of the
*  Greeks as well before that, a nervousness about allowing technology to go too far.
*  So in Alexandria, Hellenistic Alexandria, famously the steam engine is invented.
*  What do the Alexandrians use it for? They don't use it to develop steam engines.
*  So Arnold Toynbee in his kind of panoramic history of the world
*  envisages this counterfactual in which Macedonian soldiers are on steam trains, kind of chugging
*  across Mesopotamia, taking out Parthian rebels and so on. That doesn't happen. Instead, they use it
*  to power temple kind of gimmicks so that people will go in and, you know, they'll use steam and
*  the statue of a god will move or something like that. There's a story told of the emperor Tiberius
*  that somebody approaches him and says, look, I've made unbreakable glass. And Tiberius is very
*  interested, asks for it to be tested. It's shown that this glass is indeed unbreakable and the
*  inventor is delighted and thinks that Tiberius is going to reward him. Au contraire, Tiberius has
*  been put to death and the secret buried. And the justification for that is that if a glass is
*  unbreakable, then what will that do for glassmakers? You know, it's very bad. There's another story
*  that's told of the emperor Vespasian that somebody approaches him and says when they're trying to
*  rebuild the Capitoline temple that's been destroyed in the great fire in AD 69 that I mentioned
*  earlier, look, I've developed this brilliant crane. It's an excellent labor-saving device.
*  And again, it is said Vespasian refuses to use it because it will put the common people of Rome
*  out of work. So I think that there is, I mean, I don't think either of those stories are likely
*  to be true, but the fact that they are told clearly articulates a suspicion of technology
*  as being the enemy of basically keeping, as the emperors and the elites of the classical world
*  see it, keeping the lower orders busy. And what will happen if they're not kept busy?
*  It's a kind of Luddite perspective, perhaps. So, you know, as I say, it's not, I don't want to
*  imply that I have studied this in any great or specific detail, but my sense is that there is
*  a strain of Luddism, Ludditism in the classical world that makes them suspicious of anything
*  that might lead to what might seem to be labor-saving, which of course you see, you
*  know, in the earliest of the Industrial Revolution in Britain as well. You know, that's where
*  Luddites are, people breaking mills and all kinds of things like that.
*  You know, it's an anxiety that continues into the present day, doesn't it? Of course.
*  You know, people are worrying about it.
*  Large language models. They terrify many historians.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Moving into the present day, you're involved in a pro-UK union think tank called These Islands
*  that wants to keep the United Kingdom together. Do you feel that the devolution of so much
*  political power to Scotland and Northern Ireland in retrospect was a mistake?
*  No, I'm all in favor of devolution. I think that Britain, before the Second World War, was a state
*  in which power was devolved to Scotland, to Wales, to Northern Ireland, but also to the great cities
*  of England as well, to Birmingham. So Joseph Chamberlain, the mayor of Birmingham, absolute
*  kind of embodiment of a high-achieving mayor who shaped and reconfigured the architecture and the
*  industry of his city. And I think that the challenge of defeating Hitler, the British state
*  became so centralized that we live with the kind of, you know, we have long Second World War,
*  if you want to put it like that, that the after effects have continued for the last few years.
*  After effects have continued for too long. And it's partly the Second World War, it's partly the
*  fact that we had a very centralizing Labour government that wanted to concentrate kind of
*  power in its hands. So the health secretary, you know, he institutionalized the National Health
*  Service. And he famously said that he, you know, he didn't want a nurse to change a bedpan
*  in any hospital across the country without him knowing about it. And I think that we live with
*  the after effects of that. And so therefore, actually, I'm all in favor of devolution. I
*  don't think that devolution is the enemy of the United Kingdom and the union of the constituent
*  parts of the United Kingdom. I think it's the best way for the United Kingdom to function properly.
*  And I think that what we're going through at the moment is kind of process of teething problems.
*  We're trying to kind of test and work it out. But it's I think it's a creative process.
*  And my hope is that it will, you know, I'm an optimist, I hope that it will work out for the
*  best. But isn't Irish unification in particular, almost inevitable, and we should just rip off the
*  bandaid and get it over with? Again, I think that the complexities of syphology in Ireland,
*  and specifically Northern Ireland, is way beyond my pay grade. It is incredibly complicated.
*  And my understanding is that as sectarian identity, so the proportion of people in
*  Northern Ireland who identify as either Catholic or Protestant fades. That doesn't automatically
*  mean that it doesn't translate automatically into a desire necessarily to remain in the union or to
*  join a united Ireland. But that there is a solid core, nevertheless, that prefers remaining in the
*  UK to joining Ireland. And I think that that is further complicated by the fact that in Ireland,
*  Northern Ireland is now much poorer than Ireland itself. I think they would, I think that, you know,
*  as I say, I'm not an expert on the syphology of this. But my hunch is that there would be
*  nervousness on the part of voters in Ireland as well as in Northern Ireland about the costs,
*  the challenges, the problems of doing it. I agree. I mean, it might seem kind of,
*  it's often cast as though there's a kind of inevitability. And if that is what people in
*  Northern Ireland want, then that is absolutely what people in Northern Ireland must have.
*  But I think it's less inevitable than the kind of the way in which the Protestant population is in
*  decline, the Catholic population is growing. I don't think it necessarily follows quite
*  to the degree that I would say that anything about it is inevitable.
*  Soterios Johnson The Church of England so suffuses your government.
*  Is it stable in the long run to have 5% or fewer of the population attend that church and in some
*  ways have Islam as the most influential religion in, say, Britain? How's that going to work out?
*  Okay, so first of all, Islam is in no way the most influential religion in Britain. Islam has been
*  radically Christianized in Britain. Muslims like Jews, like Hindus, like Christians indeed,
*  have freedom of religion. But what that means is that they are essentially obliged to see
*  themselves as belonging to a religion. In the case of Muslims as belonging to a religion called Islam.
*  Classically, that is not how Muslims understood what Islam was. Islam was an entire way of life.
*  Islam was not something to be kind of siphoned off from something called the secular and kind
*  of ghettoized in that way. Au contraire, it was something that saturated everything. But this is
*  this is the legacy of that little acorn that I was talking about when I said, you know,
*  I was talking about Jesus saying, render unto Caesar. This idea that there are two dimensions
*  that I mentioned that today we call the secular and the religious. This is a legacy specifically
*  of Christianity. And so Muslims living in Britain, to that extent, are secularized. Of course, there
*  are Muslims who resent this. You know, these are Muslims who tend to be categorized as extremists,
*  as people who reject this idea that Islam should be just a religion, who want to see the whole of
*  Britain become subject to an Islamic state. But these are a tiny minority. Most Muslims have
*  internalized the idea of the secular in exactly the way that Jews have done or Hindus have done,
*  or indeed Catholics have done, or Protestants have done. This is, and so to that extent,
*  I think that Muslims have been radically Protestantized. Now, it may be that this is
*  a huge, you know, this is precisely the problem for the Church of England, that everything that
*  made it distinctive, everything that kind of made it the foundation stone of the English and then
*  British state that it became, no longer necessary. You don't need the Church of England for it. And
*  I think you could say more largely that this is a problem for Christians in Britain, and maybe in
*  America as well, that in a way they've won too comprehensively. People don't need Christianity
*  anymore to do all kinds of things. By and large, you know, it was the Church of England that was
*  responsible for education, often for healthcare, often for the provision of charity in Britain.
*  All those have basically been nationalized. You know, we have the state now, organizes education,
*  healthcare, benefits. So what's the Church for? And that's a huge, you know, that's an
*  existential problem for the Church. However, I think that, again, you know, it's, if you imagine,
*  I mean, I kind of, it's kind of clarified for me by the experience of the Queen's death and funeral,
*  and the mourning period for her, that I think suddenly people in, not everyone, there were lots
*  of people who were very annoyed by it, but lots of people were surprised by how moved they were
*  by that, those whole two strange weeks, and actually quite liked it. They quite liked the sense
*  of the weird that those two weeks opened up. You know, the body of a Queen who's a lineal
*  descendant of Alfred the Great and Odin and Adam, if her line of descent is to be trusted,
*  lying in state, you know, in a parliament, you know, in the great hall built by the son of William
*  the Conqueror, the great ceremony in Westminster Abbey built by Edward the Confessor,
*  the transfer of the body, later state in the chapel at Windsor where Henry VIII and Charles
*  I bodies lie, that this sense of communion with the Christian past, the royal past,
*  even Republicans quite enjoyed it. And I think the fact that only, say, I don't even know if
*  it's 5%, I mean, you're quoting me, probably, I'm sure you got the figure right. I'm surprised
*  it's actually that high. It's an estimate. Yeah. I think because people don't feel strongly about
*  the Church of England either way, by and large people are happy for it to stay where it is,
*  rather than the way that people don't particularly want to, you know, people may not be going to a
*  large church in the middle of a town, but that doesn't mean that they want to remove it and
*  build a supermarket there. As a historian, surely you value British heritage, the wonderfully
*  manicured look of the English countryside, and for that matter, the hedgehog. Yet my friends,
*  my economist friends tell me we need millions more of homes in southern England because the cost of
*  living is too high, living standards are falling or stagnating, rent is an enormous problem.
*  Should we just build more in southern England? What's your view? Well, I'm not an economist,
*  you are, so you will have a much more informed view on this. I don't. And I'm aware of the
*  argument. I think, I mean, I find it intriguing that the two areas of Europe that have the highest
*  population density are also the two areas that were most, that first became capitalist.
*  So the Netherlands and southeast England. In a way, these are the kind of the motor of
*  the history of capitalism. And clearly, I guess the sense of critical mass was very important to
*  that. But I think now, both the Netherlands and England, in a way are too small. If we had the
*  space that you have in America, growth might be much easier than it's proving to be. And so
*  that sets up for us a very painful decision about what matters more, economic growth,
*  economic success, the wealth, the employment that that gives people, or the sustaining of
*  the countryside and all those creatures that depend on the countryside. And my feeling is,
*  and it's an entirely romantic one that I would not want to argue before Professor of Economics,
*  but I'm going to, is that for me, I feel that the humans who live on the island that I live on,
*  we're not the only species that inhabit this island, that there are lots of animals and birds
*  and insects and plants and trees that are bred of this island too, and that we have a kind of
*  responsibility for them. And I hate the impoverishment of our wildlife, of our
*  biodiversity. If I particularly campaign for the hedgehogs, it's partly because they are
*  an inherently appealing animal. They're kind of snuffling the way that they, when they run,
*  it looks as if they're lifting up skirts to do so. But it's also because I remember
*  the garden of my childhood where there would be hedgehogs, you'd see hedgehogs all the time.
*  I don't think my children have ever seen a hedgehog. I was driving through the country
*  in late summer last year, and ahead of me on the road, I saw a hedgehog, and it was the first time
*  I'd seen a hedgehog for a long time. And it really pains me. And I feel we have a responsibility not
*  to allow an animal like the hedgehog to go extinct. And I think more than that, if you want to talk
*  in terms of human self-interest, a world in which biodiversity collapses, and one of the reasons why
*  hedgehogs are going extinct is because there aren't enough insects for them to eat.
*  And insects, of course, are much less charismatic than hedgehogs, and so people tend not to
*  get upset about them. But if we don't have insects, if we don't have
*  the things that animals depend upon, then that's not good for humans either. The cascade effect,
*  we never know when it might suddenly ripple through.
*  Three final questions. First, what is your most unusual successful work habit?
*  My most unusual successful work habit? So when I write history,
*  I will go to libraries, I will immerse myself in academic texts, academic study, I will
*  read texts and books that are often very demanding, very
*  written in very academic prose, but I write for the general audience. And so there are times where
*  I feel that I have to emancipate myself from that. And I remember when I was writing my first book,
*  Rubicon, which is about the collapse of the Roman Republic, the great kind of the warlords of the
*  late Republic, Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, I would come back from the library, and I'd sometimes feel
*  covered in the dust of the libraries in which I'd been sitting. And before starting work,
*  I would play Ennio Morricone's music from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, as I was making myself a cup of tea.
*  And I would particularly play two tracks. One is the kind of the lust for gold, where
*  Tuco the Ugly is running around the cemetery trying to find a grave where supposedly a gold
*  has been buried. And I would always play that when I was writing about Crassus, who is the
*  great billionaire. And then when I was writing about the Triumvirate, the kind of the
*  standoff between the great warlords, I would play the brilliant music at the end of The Good, The Bad
*  and The Ugly, when there's a kind of seven minute shoot off between The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.
*  And I would always feel better going up to work having listened to that. And from that point on,
*  I've always tried to find pieces of music that will get me, it will keep me in the mood of the
*  world in which I'm writing about, but will also remind me that this is for, I'm writing for people
*  who may know nothing about it, and I have to make it interesting and accessible. Next, what is your
*  favorite movie? My favorite movie is, I think, Jurassic Park. Why Jurassic Park? I was hovering
*  over The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, which I have actually watched millions of times. But I'll tell
*  you why I love Jurassic Park. So as a child, before I got into the Romans, before I got into
*  the Greeks, I was obsessed by dinosaurs. I was one of those kind of boys. And I was a child at an age
*  where there wasn't very much about dinosaurs. It weren't on the television very often. I remember
*  there was an open university course on paleontology done by professors, so not at all aimed at
*  children. And they had one about dinosaurs. And it was the most exciting program that I watched
*  through the entire span of my childhood. Anything about dinosaurs, I was obsessed by. And
*  the films that were shown then were kind of, the dinosaurs in them were not very good. They were
*  kind of slow, ponderous. You could see that they'd be, you know, that kind of Ray Harryhausen type
*  models. So when CGI enabled Spielberg to recreate dinosaurs in the way that he did in Jurassic Park,
*  for me, it was a wonderful, wonderful moment. And you may remember in Jurassic Park,
*  the two paleontologists are in the Jeep. They're being taken by Richard Attenborough.
*  And suddenly they kind of hear a bellow and they look round. And there's kind of famous sequence
*  where Sam Neill takes his hat off and kind of goes like that. And I hadn't yet seen any of the CGI
*  dinosaurs. And when they showed the Brachiosaur coming up out of the lake and kind of leaning
*  up and feeding from the tree, the sense of wonder that Sam Neill was, Sam Neill's character was
*  obviously feeling, I felt that sense of wonder. I was so moved. I was moved almost to tears.
*  And I think, you know, as a film, I've just watched it over and over and over again, because I
*  never, that sense of wonder has never entirely left me.
*  I will again remind our audience members of Tom's current book, Dominion, How the Christian
*  Revolution Remade the World. But the final question is, after that, what will you do next?
*  Well, I am carrying on with my own podcast. The rest is history, as I said, we've just done
*  three episodes on the Cathars. We have various episodes coming up, some with definitely an
*  American bent. So we're doing some episodes on Royal Reagan. We've got the fall of Saigon to come,
*  so all kinds of things like that. And I'm able to do that and to devote myself to that.
*  I've just finished a third book in that series of books that I've written on Roman history.
*  So the first Rubicon was about the fall of the Roman Republic. I mentioned that the second
*  dynasty was dynasty, I guess I should say, was about the family of Augustus ending with the death
*  of Nero. And this new book, Pax, is about the heyday of the Roman Empire. So it runs from the
*  death of Nero up to the time of Hadrian. So it covers the era of the four emperors, the
*  sack of Jerusalem, Pompeii, the Colosseum, Hadrian's War, so lots of great stuff.
*  And that is out in America in October. Tom Harland, thank you very much.
*  Thank you so much for having me. Great honour.
