# Atul Gawande on Priorities, Big and Small | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4)
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=0.0s)]
*  bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=8.32s)]
*  Learn more at mercatus.org. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=12.5s)]
*  And for more conversations, including videos, transcripts, and upcoming dates, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  visit conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=19.8s)]
*  I'm here up in Boston with Atul Gawande, and we're going to talk about health, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=23.2s)]
*  healthcare, healthcare policy, and Atul Gawande himself. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=30.8s)]
*  So let me start with a question about artificial intelligence. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=34.8s)]
*  How far are we from having an AI that is capable of actually doing diagnosis to people, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=38.2s)]
*  that is, they might speak into a Skype connection, something like Watson would hear what they say, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=44.2s)]
*  and they would then diagnose the person well enough that this would be a usable form of healthcare? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=48.800000000000004s)]
*  Is that far, close? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=53.4s)]
*  Massively far. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  I think it is one of the hardest things. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=56.2s)]
*  You want me to tell why? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  Tell us why, yes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=60.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=61.5s)]
*  So the diagnosis process, people imagine what it is, is that people come to you with a crisply defined problem. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=62.0s)]
*  I have symptom one, two, three. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=69.1s)]
*  I have data to add to it, and now give me the answer. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  And the reality is, first of all, people come to you often unable to explain what their problem is. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=79.0s)]
*  I have pain. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=84.4s)]
*  Where? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=85.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's sort of here, and they'll point with a hand. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=86.7s)]
*  Well, do you mean there under your rib cage, or do you mean in your chest? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=89.4s)]
*  So you have this probing process that is part of it, and how they tell the story. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  And then there's also how their story had evolved over time, and they often have to put it in their words. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=100.8s)]
*  So it's more of a narrative than it is a straight set of data. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  So that's problem one. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=112.3s)]
*  You know, when I think of IBM Watson put their AI on this problem, and it would never be the problem I would have put them on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=114.1s)]
*  The second part of it is that it changes over time, and you're adding data along the way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=122.6s)]
*  And so you're integrating it with a little bit about your view of the understanding of the person and their likelihood to even say that something is a major symptom or not. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=127.9s)]
*  There is no question that you can augment the human capability. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=142.3s)]
*  But the idea that pull out your phone and it would give you the diagnosis, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=146.5s)]
*  it is still one of the hardest problems in reducing error in medicine is the fact that we that we still have a high rate of error. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=157.0s)]
*  And the sources of the error have to do with the human being rather than the calculation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=167.9s)]
*  But say you only get 15 minutes with your doctor, which is pretty common. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=173.4s)]
*  And as you know, those conversations don't always run so well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=176.8s)]
*  People are intimidated. They forget the right question to ask. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=180.0s)]
*  You could have three hours talking to something like Watson. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=183.0s)]
*  Maybe 80 percent of the dialogue is nonsense. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=185.8s)]
*  But at the end, you apply machine learning. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=188.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, the alternative now is that people use Google, which is, in a sense, the world's number one doctor. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=190.10000000000002s)]
*  Right. So AI only needs to be better than Google, which is already a form of AI. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=194.8s)]
*  So in that sense, isn't it just around the corner that it would be a marginal improvement on what we have today? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. So the one is the replacement question. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=204.8s)]
*  Right. So can I simply have something that will make the diagnosis and lots of reasons why that's difficult? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=207.9s)]
*  But now to augment the human capability. Absolutely. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=214.6s)]
*  There already is a there are programs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=218.0s)]
*  One example is called Isabelle, where if the clinician having elicited all of this information can simply put the the the observations into a list, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=220.4s)]
*  it will allow them to recognize, OK, fine. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=233.1s)]
*  You think it's problem that what they have is diagnosis one. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=236.5s)]
*  But here are eight others in rank order of consideration compared to the one that you think. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=240.2s)]
*  And there have been plenty of studies and it's been around for more than a decade without the need for AI. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=246.2s)]
*  This is just this is just crunching some basic data to begin with that that that can add and that can add add real value. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=252.2s)]
*  I think the the puzzle of it is that you need that capability to integrate information coming from the person, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=263.79999999999995s)]
*  interpret it and be able to to to get it into these kinds of systems. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=272.5s)]
*  And in many cases, people may be able to do some of that over time for themselves. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=276.29999999999995s)]
*  How worried are you about CRISPR? Imagine parents sitting down trying to shape the children they will have using advanced technology of some kind or another. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=283.7s)]
*  Will those parents on average make the right choices, improving choices? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  Will this be a disaster? What's your view? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=295.7s)]
*  So CRISPR, the great thing about this podcast is I'm going to presume we don't need to explain what gene editing is for this audience. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  But so there are plenty of reasons to be worried about CRISPR in my mind. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  The one you just named is not one of them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=312.8s)]
*  Just like in the days of, you know, the first in vitro fertilization and the and and baby Louise, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=316.3s)]
*  who was the first test to baby and now what's going to happen and we're going to we're going to we're going to destroy humanity and all of those kinds of things. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=323.3s)]
*  I don't think that's that's the case. Yes, there will be some forms of selection. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=332.2s)]
*  We already have massive amounts of sex sex selection in the world, which is a problem is a serious problem. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=337.7s)]
*  That's very harmful, but has nothing to do with advanced technologies. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=346.0s)]
*  It has to do with the basic capabilities of ultrasound and and selective abortion going on all over the world. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=350.4s)]
*  The the issues with CRISPR have to do with the capacity to add other. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=359.3s)]
*  First of all, there's unpredictable things that people will discover that you can try to do with gene editing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=369.1s)]
*  And then you couple it with capabilities. For example, CRISPR enables gene editing that, you know, is basically is fairly fixed. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=375.6s)]
*  But if you now can propagate that edited gene in a mosquito or in another organism, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=387.5s)]
*  now you can have rapid cycle diffusion of those kinds of capabilities. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  And I don't think we've thought through that in the least. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  Won't parents discriminate against having strange or weird or unusual children that his parents will be too risk averse? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=402.6s)]
*  So maybe a stranger person has a higher chance of being a genius. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=409.5s)]
*  A lot of parents, they just want kids who are 15 percent better than they are and more or less along the same dimensions. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=412.9s)]
*  There's a great article this week about George Church's narcolepsy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=419.0s)]
*  Yes. In in stat news. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=422.7s)]
*  And and the the danger to me isn't CRISPR. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=425.2s)]
*  The danger is the larger culture that it goes into, of which CRISPR is just one of many capabilities. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  So George Church, famous genomics pioneer, biotech researcher who's had tremendous influence and has been one of the most creative forces in the field, has narcolepsy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  And he attributes a lot of his insights and capabilities. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=449.5s)]
*  The fact that he falls into a deep REM sleep at the drop of a hat and then wakes up during seminars. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=454.5s)]
*  The best time. Right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  Right. He had to stop driving because of what happened during driving. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  But he would drop into these dream states and then wake up with unbelievable ideas. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=465.79999999999995s)]
*  And there's lots of ways in which he is a, you know, a unique and and an apparent might think, you know, aberrant person and you wouldn't select for what he has brought to the world. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=470.8s)]
*  And there are lots of, you know, neuro atypical phenotypes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  The CRISPR capability is just another bullet in the holster that can be fired. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=490.5s)]
*  But we're we are narrowing that neurotypical range in lots and lots of different directions, whether it's how we employ people, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=499.29999999999995s)]
*  kinds of options we put out there for people to have their their aberrant thinking recognized and taken advantage of to the medical the ways we medicate and and control people. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=508.8s)]
*  And I think CRISPR, it actually will be exceedingly difficult to be able to pick many of these capabilities out in part because they're multi-gene. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=523.4s)]
*  These are not conditions that have to do that are very often have to do with point mutations that you just adjust. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  They are interactions among many genes in the network. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=541.2s)]
*  You run big data and every generation the chance of outliers falls by one percent. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=544.4000000000001s)]
*  And then over time, it's going to make a big difference. Right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=548.7s)]
*  That's right. It's not that you control the kid who's going to pop out of the womb in nine months. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=551.0s)]
*  But over time, it seems it will compound. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=555.6s)]
*  It seems more and more patients are awake during surgery. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=559.9000000000001s)]
*  Right. Yes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  Awake procedures. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=563.5s)]
*  How is this changing the culture of the operating room? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=564.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So it's been very interesting. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  We one of the things I brought into surgery with our team has been running a series of running a checklist just like a pilot's checklist in the operating room. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=570.6s)]
*  And one of the things you realize is that when you have an awake patient in the operating room, they can be part of the team. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=581.0s)]
*  And and you know, not just someone sitting there who is annoyingly awake. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=586.3s)]
*  And so they are actually piping up to tell you they'd like to change the music you're playing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=592.5s)]
*  But also what I would do. Right. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=596.3s)]
*  But there's but also that you're, you know, so in neurosurgery, you are actually they're actively part of the operation because they're often speaking and telling you things so that you know if you're causing any difficulties. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=598.6s)]
*  But what we've found even in the kinds of operations I do, which are not brain operations, is that being able to ask them from the very beginning of the operation to be part of the team by saying, you know, are we on the same page about what your medical issues are, what your goals are for the operation, what we have to look out for in addition to the usual safety things. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=613.0s)]
*  But also, you know, what are the what are the key things? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=636.2s)]
*  Oh, you know, I tend to have a bad back and and I don't want to lie in this position for too long. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  In many ways, having people awake can be far safer. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=643.3000000000001s)]
*  The other thing, though, is that there are people who, when they're awake, don't handle it very well. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=648.2s)]
*  And you have to be able to adjust on the fly and people have to understand that you may need to. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=653.6s)]
*  Why do surgeons sometimes leave sponges behind in the bodies of patients who are being operated on? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  You zeroed in on the first one of my very first projects, creating intervention. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=665.1s)]
*  So we had done a case control study of of this problem of people of surgeons leaving sponges inside people and got it published in the New England Journal, partly because of our whole method of going about solving this problem, which was we studied 60 people who had sponges left inside them compared to 240 people at the same institution at the same time with the same operation. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  Who didn't have sponges left inside them. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=695.1s)]
*  And there was an interesting problem to me because the the rate of sponges being left inside people had been steady for 30 years. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=697.1s)]
*  We had not made it go down at all. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=705.7s)]
*  It was right around one in a thousand to one in three thousand or so operations. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=708.1s)]
*  A sponge would be left inside and it would be a disaster. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=714.6s)]
*  You would have to go back about two thirds of the time people had become infected. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=718.0s)]
*  One of the 60 was a patient who died because a a small sponge had been left in their brain. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=723.1s)]
*  And the usual way that we track these things is by counting everything at the beginning of the operation twice and everything at the end of an operation. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=729.1s)]
*  And what we found was that it wasn't because people were skipping the steps along the way. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=740.1s)]
*  The nurses were consistently counting everything at the beginning and counting everything at the end. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=746.1s)]
*  So it wasn't a broken system. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=750.9s)]
*  It was a fallible system. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=754.1s)]
*  So it's like counting whether you have 52 cards in the deck and you have 51 and you or you have 53 at a predictable rate of getting the count wrong. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=756.1s)]
*  And sure enough about one in 1500 to one in 3000 times they would just get it wrong and not know it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=766.1s)]
*  So we in that case identified that we would need to create a technological solution. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=772.1s)]
*  So it was you know that in the end we came up with a barcoding approach. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=780.1s)]
*  It's an interesting economic problem. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=786.1s)]
*  There are 100. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=788.1s)]
*  It's 140. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=789.1s)]
*  At the time we were doing this it was 140 million dollar sponge industry for which there was half a billion dollars. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=790.1s)]
*  Spent per year on lawsuits for sponges being left inside. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=795.9s)]
*  So from a pricing point of view it worked out to about a penny a sponge. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=798.9s)]
*  So you had to have a solution that you know could double the price to two cents or three cents. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=802.9s)]
*  But you couldn't stick a you had to increase the costs a lot if you're going to stick a microchip or a RFID system on there. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=808.9s)]
*  So we just put barcoding on there kept the costs pretty minimal. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=818.9s)]
*  And it and it completely eliminated the problem because now you have teams scanning them in as they as they do the operation at the beginning of the operation and then scanning all of the sponges out. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=822.9s)]
*  And the only fallibility is that people will ignore the machine. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=835.9s)]
*  And those are so there's the only times there have been sponges left after tens of millions of these kinds of cases. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=840.9s)]
*  Do your awake patients ever come in with a checklist and at the end say hey if you got all your sponges. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=846.9s)]
*  So I definitely have had I've not had people come in with a checklist but invariably and we actually but they should right. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=852.9s)]
*  Well it's not that you want people to come in with their checklists right because each place has a flow in a way that they do it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=861.9s)]
*  But what you want to know is do you have does you does the place you go to do they use a checklist. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=867.9s)]
*  Now they will always say that they do because because everybody does at some level. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=873.9s)]
*  But the key is does the checklist have them stop before the incision not to check that you have the right person and the right side of the body which is something everybody standardly does. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=878.9s)]
*  But to actually make sure everybody in the room is introduced to one another and they've reviewed the goals of the operation and the key your key medical issues as well as the key points of the operation like what equipment are needed. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=890.9s)]
*  Those are the big parts that the team skip but make a really big difference. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=904.9s)]
*  What are the biggest mistakes and how checklists are used. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=910.9s)]
*  Keeping in mind most of the people who do or could use them they're not people like you who've written books on checklists and who know many many different things but they're highly imperfect fallible people who are making mistakes anyway and if allowed to codify their mistakes in the form of the checklist. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=913.9s)]
*  Can it make things worse rather than better. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=927.9s)]
*  What's your main worry about checklists. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=929.9s)]
*  Yeah so basically we rolled it out in in in our initial trial in eight cities around the world and found a 47 percent reduction in death when the teams took up the checklist. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=931.9s)]
*  The main barrier since then has been that it either becomes a tick box effort or no one uses it at all. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=943.9s)]
*  So the it was designed to turn people's brain on by enabling a conversation about the critical events and concerns of the operation. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=950.9s)]
*  And so what we see is a couple of things we we gathered for example we had people send in the current the version of the checklist that they're using and about 150 places sent them in and part of it was interesting is. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=960.9s)]
*  Almost 100 percent change the checklist you have to change it to fit into your environment for example in England you put the patient to sleep outside the operating room and then you and then you roll them in so the checklist has to the order of it has to change. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=974.9s)]
*  So one concern is that if you just use it out of the box you're not really using you have to adjust it to your environment. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=989.9s)]
*  The second concern so looking at these 150 we'd see places that had turned our 19 item checklist the most extreme example they turned it into an 81 item checklist. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=997.9s)]
*  It was impossible to use we'd specifically designed it to be something you could run through in 60 seconds or less at each each pause point so you weren't distracted from the main operation and you could see that at the administration in the hospital had got a hold of it and they were using it to try to impose their ideas. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1010.9s)]
*  And if essentially the clinical team was was not the team that had were designing and and controlling the checklist and so invariably look at that and you know that everybody is completely ignoring it and it's become just a tick box effort instead of a an enabler of greater capability. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1030.9s)]
*  Let's say one of your kids further on is thinking of getting married and says they had should I use a checklist yes or no. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1049.9s)]
*  Yeah well I think every every wedding planner this is the ceremony for the choice of spouse oh for the choice of spouse so that's a very good question. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1056.9s)]
*  I suppose the first question is is it an arranged marriage or not arranged marriage because if it's an arranged marriage that's practically a checklist process right. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1066.9s)]
*  Yes but but you know love is if it's a love marriage love does not follow the checklist. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1075.9s)]
*  There are now so many papers although there are probably some mistakes I could put on the checklist that would be really smart to consider. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1084.9s)]
*  So you're leaning back towards the checklist. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1091.9s)]
*  There's so many papers you probably know all or most of them that appear to show low marginal values for health treatment on actual health care outcomes. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1094.9s)]
*  So Amish people who don't get that much health care they have good life expectancy Christian scientists. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1104.9s)]
*  There's the old 1970s rand randomized control trial study where free health care only made the poorest of people healthier. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1110.9s)]
*  There's the Oregon Medicaid paper. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1117.9s)]
*  There's a few papers when the doctors go on strike more people don't die when they're sent to the hospital. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1119.9s)]
*  What do you make of all of this strand of literature and why does it seem to be such a weak connection between health care and health outcomes. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1124.9s)]
*  Yes so I think it depends on what you measure and over what period of time. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1131.9s)]
*  So now there's been an accumulation of enough data about for example coverage expansions like the ACA like the Massachusetts reforms etc. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1135.9s)]
*  That I think there's actually some good understanding what there is. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1146.9s)]
*  First of all they consistently show that people get a range of services that they that they get increased access to primary care specialty care medications chronic illness care emergency care. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1150.9s)]
*  The the the one that there are elements of it that are much more powerful than others and so chronic illness care primary care and mental health care seem to produce really substantial improvements in people's self reported health physical health and their and their mental health. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1166.9s)]
*  But self reported health is tricky you look at life expectancy. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1186.9s)]
*  You look at the Amish it's hard. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1189.9s)]
*  Well I'm going to say two things about that number one is it's not obvious to me that that that may not be a primary goal. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1191.9s)]
*  So first of all that your your reported well-being about your physical and mental health is in fact when people come in to see clinicians what they're trying to optimize. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1199.9s)]
*  The second part of it though is on in terms of survival then what you see is it takes time. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1210.9s)]
*  So the Oregon study for example was only four years I think it was not even four years under a year and a half for a small group of people and the and the death reduction was not significant non significant but the amount of death reduction you'd have to achieve would have had to been greater than 50 percent reduction in death which is a massive level the fact of measure to 16 percent reduction in death but it just wasn't significant. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1217.9s)]
*  The subsequent studies that have looked over longer periods of time they see two things first of all there are significant reductions in death. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1243.9s)]
*  The estimates are from one in three hundred to one in eight hundred people who gain coverage will per year have their life saved which is a highlight high level of value translates into tens of thousands of lives. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1251.9s)]
*  But second is that you wouldn't be surprised that people getting treatment for their HIV for their cancer for their chronic diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes and so on it takes time to accumulate and and it appears to be some years so like the Massachusetts data were were basically what they show is that the strength of the value gets higher as time goes on. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1265.9s)]
*  There's a further underlying point which is though that you know we are not actually maximizing by any reasonable measure those outcomes so biggest killer in the country's high blood pressure we have a third of adults have high blood pressure. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1288.9s)]
*  Sixty percent are receiving incomplete and inappropriate care within the medical system. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1303.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1310.9s)]
*  And so they're they're not actually getting the biggest killer under control. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1311.9s)]
*  And they don't follow instructions. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1315.9s)]
*  Well that's that's that's a mix of not necessarily getting the right treatment in the first place not getting the right follow up and and yes it might not be not following instructions but when we poke into why. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1316.9s)]
*  Well there's copays and deductibles that can block out being on those medications and then people are making choices. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1328.9s)]
*  Some people are having side effects that lead them to stop it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1334.9s)]
*  Some people are just way disorganized and need you know there's actually CVS has been able to track why people stop medication they have six different kinds of patterns with which people are not adherent to their medications each of which actually have effective solutions to target. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1338.9s)]
*  So you know the the the big point is high blood pressure is one of the simplest things that we can take on where we're terribly organized for being able to deliver on it. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1359.9s)]
*  It's the biggest killer in the country Kaiser followed through on being able to take it instead of from only 40 percent appropriate care to greater than 80 percent and saw their entire population flip from the number one killer being cardiovascular disease. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1367.9s)]
*  They also worked on improving statin use and flipped from it being number one to no longer being the number one killer cancer now is the number one killing their population. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1382.9s)]
*  Minnesota followed through on a similar program got adherence up to 70 percent and made the same flip as well and now we have several states where cardiovascular disease no longer the number one killer by getting some of these basic measures under control and that's just about health care. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1392.9s)]
*  Being good but having really poor reliability given the amount of money we spend in health care. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1409.9s)]
*  What's the number one thing missing in medical education today for doctors. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1417.9s)]
*  I think the number one thing is an education around the fact that we are no longer a craft. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1421.9s)]
*  It's no longer an individual craft of being the smartest most experienced and capable individual. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1427.9s)]
*  It's a profession that has exceeded the capabilities of any individual to have have to manage the volume of knowledge and skill required. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1435.9s)]
*  So we are now delivering as groups of people and knowing how to be an effective group how to solve problems when your group is not being effective and and to enable that capability. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1445.9s)]
*  That I think is not being taught it's not being researched it is it is the biggest opportunity to advance human health and we're not delivering on it. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1460.9s)]
*  The famous late 19th century early 20th century Dr. William Osler he once said here's a quotation look wise say nothing and grunt speech was given to conceal thought true or false. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1471.9s)]
*  False but there's a grain of truth. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1483.9s)]
*  So one of the things that I learned in writing my last book being mortal was talking to palliative care clinicians and geriatricians and others who who who really have a different kind of approach to practice. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1489.9s)]
*  They examining the way I practice what they would say I do is talk too much and as one put it your problem a tool is a urine explain a holic our model of what a clinician does is that they are doctor informative. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1507.9s)]
*  They give you data about what condition you have data about the options here are the option a option B option C risks benefits pros cons and now what would you like to do. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1523.9s)]
*  We provide it's a conversation where we do 95% of the talking and then the patient does 5% and what they point out is that they the clinicians of the future really need to be oriented in a counselor mode where they are not just telling you what the options are. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1536.9s)]
*  But also eliciting from you very clearly what your goals are and then making a recommendation about what much most matches your goals so what are your priorities for your quality of life as as well as quantity of life so you know people have parties besides mere survival. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1556.9s)]
*  When we don't ask and don't know how to ask what those priorities are the treatment is often mismatched with those priorities and that's where you get suffering and that's where you get lots of hot air from doctors and you have you have total misalignment when you are able to elicit those goals. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1573.9s)]
*  And then align the care with it you have massively better outcomes both for quantity and quality of life. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1591.9s)]
*  Do you ever worry that doctors become corrupted by their own authority not corrupted in the sense of taking bribes but they have such authority people look up to them they say well you know take off your clothes sit on the table people do it people are in the mode of obeying. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1597.9s)]
*  And a lot of patients frankly are probably a pain so doctors in a sense can manipulate patients to make each interaction easier because they're such high status figures and then doctors fall into this mode of being used to doing that with people in general. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1612.9s)]
*  What do you think are the main psychological dangers of corruption that can stem from being a doctor and having such high status control over life or death you can cure people the gods cannot that's what Sir Thomas Brown said right. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1629.9s)]
*  So I think this there is I think that the health system of every country every country is a demonstration of our corrupt ability. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1642.9s)]
*  The Kenneth arrows 1960s essay on a symmetry of information used health care as its prominent example that sellers are more powerful than buyers when we not only control the decision set we control the option set and. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1652.9s)]
*  And the opportunity and ability of the individual to understand all of those to be able to make choices among them is hindered especially when you are sick so the most powerful. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1673.9s)]
*  Tool that a clinician has is their pen and is the power to. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1693.9s)]
*  Order medications to tests to doing an operation so yes the power of the fact that look it's. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1699.9s)]
*  It's an unusual profession in that yes we can ask you to sit on the table and make yourself you know the most vulnerable in the most vulnerable way possible not only to ask you to take off your clothes but then you know to actually have permission to cut you open. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1710.9s)]
*  And do what I choose to do inside you. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1730.9s)]
*  That is a tremendous power and the ways in which we see that just the payment incentives alone dramatically affect whether I tend my tendency is to give you over treatment in certain situations and under treatment and others is a reflection of our. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1735.9s)]
*  Of our failure to follow through on being able to deal with the variability in in that and how we use that asymmetry of information a lot of critics have charged that to get a new drug through the FDA it takes too many years and too much money. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1753.9s)]
*  And that somehow the process should be liberalized do you agree or disagree. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1768.9s)]
*  So I generally disagree there is a there are. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1773.9s)]
*  It's a trade off in values at some basic level so in the nineteen fifties we had no real FDA and you had the opportunity to put out to innovate you know in in all kinds of ways and that innovation capability gave us modern cardiac surgery and gave us steroids and antibiotics but it also gave us frontal lobotomies and it gave us. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1781.9s)]
*  You know the the the Tuskegee experiment in a variety of other things the process of asking that that our. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1806.9s)]
*  That out with that we have regulation around both the ethics of what we're doing and that we have some safety process along the way. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1817.9s)]
*  Is totally appropriate now I think a lot of lessons about when the HIV community became involved in the FDA process to drive approaches that smoothed and sped up the decision making process and also got the public enough involved to be able to say we that you know that community said look there are places where we're willing to take greater risks for the sake of speed right that is. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1826.9s)]
*  Is that to me is that people are trying to treat the FDA process is a technical issue when what it is is it's an issue about what are the risks we are genuinely willing to take and what are the risks that were not so the bigger is seen pretty invisible so some drug you've never heard of it doesn't even exist yet you never get it and you die that's not very salient to people so it seems insofar as the public judges the risk maybe they're getting it wrong. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1854.9s)]
*  No that's right that the the way to think about it though is that we have a certain speed with which we have accelerated passage through the FDA. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1879.9s)]
*  We are doing surveillance afterwards and then finding that the approval process leads to drugs being withdrawn from the market that is a decision that we have decided to accept acceleration especially of drugs that have to be tested on small numbers of people and then will monitor afterwards to be able to catch problems after they happen and the some of the disasters that have occurred like. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1891.9s)]
*  Like. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1914.9s)]
*  Vioxx and others where there were substantial cardiac effects happening to many many thousands of people. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1915.9s)]
*  We have we have you know there's been a backlash against that on the whole I though I think we have decided to trade that we're going to lead cause some passage allow that we decided to trade letting lots more drugs through in a little bit more quick process but then try to have surveillance afterwards now of course. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1924.9s)]
*  The result how that one of the results is we're not investing very much in that in that surveillance the worst of all worlds is speed drugs through and then close our eyes to what harm is being done after the drug is at the market and that of course is where all of the incentives are from the from the drug maker point of view. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1947.9s)]
*  And and and then when the public's not paying attention that's where we start dialing back and that's one of my fears in the current regime is that okay fine we speed up the approval process but then got the ability FDA to hold. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1968.9s)]
*  Hold the medical community to having surveillance of what happens and then pull pull the drugs on the market that are actually causing harm. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1984.9s)]
*  New surgical procedures should the FDA have a greater ability to regulate them and it has right now yes so one of the really interesting things is that basically surgical procedures are not easily protocol eyes correct and and so that you know we're still in that sort of craft world in surgery and so I as a surgeon I can kind of do whatever operation I deem appropriate and the only thing that it's regulating me is the malpractice. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=1992.9s)]
*  The threat of being sued for malpractice and colleagues saying that what I did was way outside the standard of care and made absolutely no sense. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2016.9s)]
*  The the challenges that that in a certain sense operations are crafted for each person and so that the devices you use and the drugs you use are highly regulated but the procedures you use are not I don't think it makes sense for the FDA to regulate the procedure. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2025.9s)]
*  However I do think it makes sense for the organizational organization to be held accountable for tracking what kinds of outcomes people have for procedures so the part that gets to me is that for a given procedure proven procedures we have at least two hundred fifty percent variability in the outcomes depending on the institution you go to it is primarily. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2048.9s)]
*  A function of the institution not the individual surgeon and we have no tracking virtually no tracking certainly no transparency about about what those outcomes are and what the factors are going into them and I think that's where we need to have much more information. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2071.9s)]
*  There's a middle segment of all of these conversations overrated versus underrated you're free to pass on any of these of course but I'll toss out a few things and you tell me what you think underrated or overrated Stevie Wonder. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2092.9s)]
*  I think he's now become underrated he was over he might have been overrated at one point but now he is significantly underrated and what's his best album oh gosh. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2105.9s)]
*  I'm gonna have to pass on because I lived in the world of singles like Sir Duke was my my favorite song songs in the key of life yeah well so what I might go to is going back to that era so songs in the key of life I would say bring that back Michael Crichton Dr. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2117.9s)]
*  Harvard writer what do you think where is he now I would say he might be. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2136.9s)]
*  I think you I think you've been overrated I say this is someone who was totally inspired by Michael Crichton the fact that he graduated from medical school and then a year into his residency left to do everything from directing movies like coma to writing the great train robbery and then onward to Jurassic Park. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2145.9s)]
*  But as a as a kind of influence on medical writing and on writing writ large I think that the power his power has way is waning it's his power is now well now see I'm switching from over to underrated. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2167.9s)]
*  I think he's significantly underrated yes my favorite book of his yeah it is also a brilliant art collector and I have a lot of Jasper Jones before we people and I just realized in the critical way he's underrated was in creating programs like ER which showed how you know it really has become now that the that the medical procedural just like the. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2188.9s)]
*  The idea of nudge I think overrated why I think that there are important insights in nudge units and you know in that research capacity but when you step back and say what are the biggest problems in clinical research and medical research. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2208.9s)]
*  Clinical behavior and delivery of health care the the nudges are focused on small solutions that have not demonstrated capacity for major scale. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2237.9s)]
*  Nudge is something that the kind of nudge capability something we've built into the stuff we've done whether it's checklist or coaching but it's been only one we've had to add other tools you could not get to massive reductions in deaths. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2251.9s)]
*  In surgery or childbirth or massive improvements in end of life outcomes based on just those behavioral science insights alone we've had to move to organizational insights and to it we've had a piece together multiple kinds of layers of understanding. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2264.9s)]
*  In order to drive high high volume change in in health care delivery wearables wearables I think underrated why. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2282.9s)]
*  So wearables right now don't do terribly much and and I think there's a real downside that you know what we see right now are wearables that might say track your heart rate in a you know and catch variations in your EKG and so on what what the problem is is that the wearables have not. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2293.9s)]
*  Been able to be integrated into the practice of medicine in a really critical way so right now what the way a wearable is used whether it's for tracking cardiac events or your or your mental state or other things like that is that then it says notify your doctor or it's a it's a dump of a ton of data that a clinician is supposed to use and know how to integrate into practice that. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2313.9s)]
*  That it hasn't been able to be used in such a way they're actually demonstrating major improvements in people's outcomes however. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2338.9s)]
*  We are entering this phase where we are going to be we are now starting to be able to track take your genomic data take your laboratory data take your imaging scans you've done couple it with information from wearables like how you're doing over time whether you you're getting the medications you should be getting. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2346.9s)]
*  Our team here is actually just deploying a version of a wearable which is just turning on the sensors in your phone to track patients after surgery to see whether we can define what their how long their recovery pathway is how long before they are back in their normal sleep habits are back mobilized and moving moving around much more. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2368.9s)]
*  I think that ability to have knowledge of the well-being of people that goes beyond just whether you had a complication or a death you know success of what we do for people can be enormously improved with followed by wearables and then that creates these incredible learning loops where we can we can maximize those right now invisible indications of the outcomes of care. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2390.9s)]
*  So I think the wearables are being used on the diagnostic side where it's semi powerful but not not critical but as part of how you're doing in your care and whether we're helping you achieve the goals very powerful. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2417.9s)]
*  Carl can I have scarred. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2431.9s)]
*  Can I have scarred. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2433.9s)]
*  Can I have scarred. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2434.9s)]
*  Overrated I I've read about half of the trilogy I'm totally absorbed and loved loved them but you know I feel like Elena Ferrante. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2435.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2448.9s)]
*  I think that's an example of someone who is doing much the same deeply mining the territory of somebody over history of time but managed to do it by fixing them in a place and a time in a history and a dramatic change in in in in social conditions and everything else that took it to this whole nother level in my mind. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2449.9s)]
*  What makes you weep. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2472.9s)]
*  What makes me weep. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2473.9s)]
*  I don't know what invariably makes me weep is when it might be a movie or might be just seeing someone tell the story of devoting years of time to a problem or to something they're trying to do at great pain but sticking with it and then actually getting to the end. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2475.9s)]
*  I think we under value I'm going to give two examples the movie bliss this Australian film based on Peter. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2500.9s)]
*  Oh my gosh I'm blank on the Australian writers name Peter. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2510.9s)]
*  Fire. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2513.9s)]
*  No Peter did Oscar. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2514.9s)]
*  Peter Carey. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2516.9s)]
*  Peter Carey yes. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2517.9s)]
*  Has this moment where the man is in love with a woman and plants the seeds of a forest and it takes the next decade or more before she realized this thing he built out of love and it grew. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2518.9s)]
*  And that's when she realized that in fact he loved her and that was just extraordinary and and of course made me ball like a baby. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2534.9s)]
*  And then this coming week will be our surgery graduation and it's eight people who have given the last decade of their lives to trying to craft and become who they are and they will tell the story they each get 1520 minutes of time to tell their story of what they've gone through and they have had had families and had family tragedies and they've had things that they've missed along the way. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2544.9s)]
*  And it always makes me cry because those that ability we have to commit ourselves to something larger than ourselves over a long period of time not knowing whether it'll turn out the way you think it will. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2572.9s)]
*  That is I think the most incredible thing that human beings do. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2586.9s)]
*  You've written about yourself. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2590.9s)]
*  That you are highly indecisive by nature and that you will agonize over many choices. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2592.9s)]
*  Is there any way in which you feel this which you describe as your weakness is actually your strength. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2598.9s)]
*  Yes, so I chose surgery. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2606.9s)]
*  I and I wrote in the passage you're going to be reflecting on that I chose surgery in part because I was drawn to the character of people who had that kind of decisiveness took action when inaction was the worst thing and and then you know lived with the consequences took responsibility for whatever happened. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2609.9s)]
*  Learn from it and then and then brought it to next time. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2630.9s)]
*  So I brought to surgery my particular persona which is to want to have more planning and more deliberation inserted into situations where there doesn't seem to be time and one of the really striking things is we get this complaint for example that using a checklist in in surgery. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2634.9s)]
*  Well that's fine but in emergencies we don't have time for that kind of thing and we demonstrated that in that situation taking the one and a half minutes for the very beginning part of it has enormous value it's in fact the group in whom we have the highest reduction in death are those in which the time is the most pressing and so. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2657.9s)]
*  So I think I've flipped my weakness into a strength where I can but but by you know battling with it to a certain degree so are you a good health care patient I'm a terrible health care patient what do you do wrong so for starters I don't see doctors. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2678.9s)]
*  I don't go in hardly hardly at all and I haven't had to you know so I've crossed 50 and I have never had to really be in the hospital or have a major event but to the extent that the minor conditions I've had I've come. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2698.9s)]
*  Had addressed I invariably come way late in the game when the mild infection has become a much more significant one and and you know it's partly because I know too much about the about the ways in which health care really is pretty unreliable I think a ways in which I am good at being a patient is one time. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2715.9s)]
*  I'm in the door I pick my team I'm really careful about picking my team and then. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2739.9s)]
*  Turn myself over to their process I'm trying to pick them for their ability to run a process that that seems appropriate and so I think the interesting thing about doctors is that they do tend to not micromanage their doctors very much do you feel you've under achieved in life. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2747.9s)]
*  That's a hard question. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2766.9s)]
*  I mean I know objectively that it's kind of ridiculous that I would think I've under achieved and that I'm proud of all the random things that I've been able to be part of but I bear a kind of chronic dissatisfaction and sense that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2769.9s)]
*  I've got much more to follow through on than I've managed to and so yeah I think under achieved is the wrong. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2785.9s)]
*  Word but and yet I don't feel I've achieved nearly enough and that half of what I've achieved I wish I could go back and fix. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2795.9s)]
*  I'm of the view that Clinton era welfare reforms were mostly a good idea but they've come under more and more criticism lately and you had a hand in that earlier in your career what's your two thousand seventeen view of all that how is it gone. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2806.9s)]
*  Well I think the fact that that we have the number of people who are living on under what is it four dollars a day in income and that that number skyrocketed skyrocketed that is unconscionable and a fundamental error and failure. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2819.9s)]
*  That we have sought to there are a variety of things that we that we sought not to punish people for being married that we sought to not punish people for working the shift to the earned income tax credit the. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2838.9s)]
*  The you know there's a deep and fundamental and maybe this is a Midwestern Midwestern in me. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2857.9s)]
*  Belief that we need to reward work it's one of my sort of core concerns is that the people who are at the thirtieth and fortieth percentile are served by none of the major political agendas. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2864.9s)]
*  I agree on the left and on the right and and that even Obamacare provided its great aid to those under the twenty percentile but that people at the fortieth percentile are not getting the subsidy still don't have a system that works for them and actually had to pay more into the system along the way so you know the welfare failure of that is my great concern is the number of people that are. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2880.9s)]
*  Are subsisting on horrendously little but the value of taking away the things that were punishing people for moving in the right direction still feels like an important agenda. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2908.9s)]
*  There are many smart people in medicine and surgery in writing books for that matter and writing medical books right. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2922.9s)]
*  What would you say is the tool go on a production function I asked Ross Chetty this I said rise you get a lot done. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2928.9s)]
*  What's the skill you have that other people don't have what would your answer be to that question. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2935.9s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2943.9s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2946.9s)]
*  To console I think part of it is that I I'm pretty clear about my goal which is I'm trying to have impact and and to try to do stuff that feels cool along the way that you know my team knows that my mantra is I want to do cool stuff that lasts and let's see if we can do that and and and so I think that from early on I was always iterating against that. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2950.9s)]
*  Set of goals and that I'm more or less I mean I organize my life around it I I don't watch that much TV I I get enough sleep but I'm I'm so you're decisive. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2976.9s)]
*  Well I've learned I've learned that I say yes too much and so I've learned to say no a lot. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2991.9s)]
*  Yes to this podcast. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=2999.9s)]
*  Yes sometimes yes. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3001.9s)]
*  It's serving some part of that production function there's a cool it's cool well at last we will have to test that question over time. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3003.9s)]
*  We don't talk about Obamacare too much we want people two years from now to still consider the content fresh. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3011.9s)]
*  That's how that's how I write my New Yorker pieces I I want it I mean you know my ideal is that my New Yorker pieces I'm I'm always thinking about am I writing them in such a way that in five years. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3015.9s)]
*  They could still justifiably re read and I I hope would would be that way while trying to address something that feels really sharp and of concern in the moment as well. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3025.9s)]
*  But those are your goals that's your framework what's the talent you have that say your competitors don't. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3038.9s)]
*  I really think it's just I when when I get into our hospital settings whether we're working in surgery or medicine or childbirth or other areas invariably all the main thing we have to work to do is identify. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3045.9s)]
*  What are your priorities and people in the system number one usually can't say what that is and if and then if you observe what their priorities are it's actually far away from delivering the best possible care to patients at the lowest possible cost. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3059.9s)]
*  That that that actually is a very tiny portion of the health care industry that's trying to deliver that and so I in my in my individual capacity I think it's that I'm able to spend a really high percentage of my time on on my priority I think that's all it is. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3076.9s)]
*  Now we're in Boston or at a place called Ariadne which is well known but maybe not to all of your readers it's become one of your major projects can you tell us just very briefly what is Ariadne. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3099.9s)]
*  Well so it stems out of the out of the recognition that we it is a center for health system innovation. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3110.9s)]
*  It's a for profit nonprofit part of Harvard or how does it fit into the universe. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3118.9s)]
*  Yeah so it is a it is an academic center that is part of Harvard Chan School of Public Health and the Brigham and Women's Hospital but it sits as a platform we've created for people who want to do experiments in how we bring science and innovation to the delivery of health care in the same way that you bring science and innovation to biological sciences and and so we have people come here from all of the different hospitals in the area from the business school from the school of medicine. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3121.9s)]
*  People from the school of public health from economics department and and then really built it as a place to enable capabilities to do large experiments like the experiment we just finished with the state of South Carolina five years are working with them to see whether you could get the surgeons in state to adopt the safe surgery checklist without regulation because it's a regular red state and they didn't want to mandate it but without financial incentives because they didn't have the money to pay for pay for performance and we got a program that. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3151.9s)]
*  Successfully got 40% of the population through adoption lowered the death rate 22% but to get the other 60% on board we believe you would have to bring on some mandate or other components so that's kind of director here is that I'm the director here we are now we launched it'll be five years this year and so we launched in 2012 we now are running about 20 projects in surgery childbirth and end of life care improving how you come into the world. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3181.9s)]
*  The surgery you the average American has eight operations in their lifetime the highest risk highest cost highest failure moment in your lifetime and then how you leave the world end of life care and about half of our experiments are in the United States and half are abroad for demonstrating ways to get better and better. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3211.9s)]
*  So there's a lot of people here it looks great if your director you play some role in hiring we all want people who are smart have experience dedicated cooperative diverse and so on but what what's the quality you look for that you think other people doing hiring are undervaluing. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3231.9s)]
*  What's your entrepreneurial secret to hiring well yeah so I think. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3247.9s)]
*  The it's again it's that that thing like what is your goal right off what is your priority yeah so the secret to the hiring is actually before you ever meet anybody know what the heck you're trying to hire so the hardest part sometimes to get people to understand is. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3251.9s)]
*  What is it you're asking them to do in two years give me the list this their scorecard what is there what are the five things that they will have accomplished and then make sure you show it to them when they come in the door and ask yourself as you are interviewing them and then assessing who you're going to pick not do I like this person or are they you know would they be fun to be around or all of those kinds of those are factors. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3267.9s)]
*  The ultimate question is will they be successful in this list of things that you said would define their success in two years and being again faithful that that that is maybe it is my focus talent like you know. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3293.9s)]
*  Intend do what you intend to do and do it with intention so and it is over and over that's what people fail to do you know we've got up to now 90% consistency in delivering on people who as we call them a players and it's. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3307.9s)]
*  Most of it is in that front end before they've even walked in the door being clear about that that's a step and then and then it's that they don't tell you all of it and it's how you talk to their references that's the other real big mistake people make last question according to your chat with Ezra Klein. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3330.9s)]
*  You're a big fan of what you might call contemporary independent music but to find it as you wish what would be a musical group that you love or is meaningful to you that maybe the rest of us haven't heard about that you would recommend. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3348.9s)]
*  Oh gosh so I think one of the most underrated bands is frightened rabbit do you know them out of skyline tell us about frightened rabbit so frightened rabbit they're sort of the bards of sorrow and. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3360.9s)]
*  And nonetheless sticking it through like their their their album midnight organ fight is the great breakup album of all time and you have to listen to it now you know they're Scottish so there's a whole lot of custom going on. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3373.9s)]
*  And they are and you know they're it's painful and it's dark and all those kinds of things and yeah but I always find like there's this glimmer of of hope that that that runs through it despite the. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3389.9s)]
*  Despite their ability to sort of express pain and heartbreak and and disappointment and being betrayed while still nonetheless waking up and and and sticking it through the next day. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3402.9s)]
*  On that note we close the tool go on day it's been a pleasure thank you. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqyP8_XHW4&t=3421.9s)]
