Long before Abhijit Banerjee won the 2019 economics Nobel with Michael Kremer and Esther Duflo, he was a fellow graduate student at Harvard with Tyler. For Tyler, Abhijit is one of the brightest economic minds he’s ever met, and “a brilliant theorist who decided the future was with empirical work.” But according to Abhijit, theory and practice go hand in hand: the real benefit of a randomized control trial isn’t getting unbiased estimates, he says, but in testing hypotheses borne out of theory. 

Abhijit joined Tyler to discuss his unique approach to economics, including thoughts on premature deindustrialization, the intrinsic weakness of any charter city, where the best classical Indian music is being made today, why he prefers making Indian sweets to French sweets, the influence of English intellectual life in India, the history behind Bengali leftism, the best Indian regional cuisine, why experimental economics is underrated, the reforms he’d make to traditional graduate economics training, how his mother’s passion inspires his research, how many consumer loyalty programs he’s joined, and more.

# Abhijit Banerjee on Theory, Practice, and India | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo)
*  Hi everyone, this is Tyler of Conversations with Tyler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=0.0s)]
*  I hope you've enjoyed listening to and learning from this year's conversations as much as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=7.16s)]
*  I have. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=11.92s)]
*  For me, it's the single most rewarding and instructive thing I do. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=12.92s)]
*  This year, some of my absolute favorites have been, for instance, Neil Stephenson talking [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=16.92s)]
*  about science fiction, the future, and innovation, Masha Gessen on Russia and Putin and the history [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  of communism. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=28.26s)]
*  Russ Roberts on market economics, Karl Knausgaard on Norway, Henrik Ibsen, Norwegian art, Emily [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=29.64s)]

*  If you've benefited from this podcast and enjoyed it, please consider making a financial [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=43.04s)]
*  contribution before the end of the year at conversationswithtyler.com slash donate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=47.58s)]
*  All donations will go to the production of the show, including, first, new conversations [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=55.84s)]
*  every other week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=60.84s)]
*  And note that unlike most other podcasts, we often have to pay to travel to our guests [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=62.02s)]
*  and we have never done a remote interview. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=67.08s)]
*  Second, live shows in Arlington, Virginia, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  and more locales to come. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Third, full readable transcripts of every episode enhanced with helpful links. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=78.0s)]
*  For me, doing Conversations with Tyler is about learning from other people and teaching [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=83.6s)]
*  other people how to learn. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=89.16s)]
*  And that's what I try to do in each episode, is to show how listening and asking good questions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  produces knowledge and how that can help make the world a wiser place. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=97.0s)]
*  So, if you believe in the power of learning through listening and reading, as I do, please [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=101.84s)]
*  support the podcast at conversationswithtyler.com slash donate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=107.18s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  I'm very pleased to be here today with Abhijit Banerjee, one of the recent Nobel Laureates [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=137.18s)]
*  in Economics. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=149.86s)]
*  He is professor of economics at MIT, author, co-author, rather, of the recent bestseller [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  with Esther Duflo, Good Economics for Hard Times. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Abhijit and I also went to graduate school together at Harvard and he is one of the most [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=159.68s)]
*  brilliant economic minds I have ever met, heard or read. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=164.56s)]
*  So Abhijit, welcome. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=168.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=169.86s)]
*  With that introduction, I'm going to be shy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=170.86s)]
*  Let me start with a question about economic development. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=172.66s)]
*  Danny Rodrik has argued that premature deindustrialization is a significant problem for emerging economies, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=175.78s)]
*  that in essence, they are moving into manufacturing at a time when automation already has happened, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=183.02s)]
*  and this will not for these countries build a middle class. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=188.1s)]
*  What do you think of this argument? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=190.8s)]
*  Well, it's sort of beyond my competence, to be honest. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  It seems like reading lots of tea leaves, but my instincts are that he's right. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=195.38000000000002s)]
*  And I think there's additional problems. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=200.06s)]
*  One of them is just that the fact that there's so much inequality in the world means that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=201.94s)]
*  the products that are being designed now, a lot of the new money is being spent on, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=208.36s)]
*  are products that are where the component of quality is extremely high. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=217.0s)]
*  They tend to be products that are like, think of kids' toys. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=223.74s)]
*  Most of kids' toys are a matter of checking and making sure that they have nothing dangerous [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=227.26s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=232.56s)]
*  And the checking is often done in actually in other places, in Germany, for example, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=233.64s)]
*  or some of the things that checking is done in Germany, even though the manufacturing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=238.9s)]
*  is done in China. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=242.8s)]
*  As a result, the cost part of manufacturing is extremely small part of the price of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=244.14s)]
*  good. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=250.27999999999997s)]
*  So what we pay in the US for the toy, a tenth of that might be the cost, the labor cost [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=251.44s)]
*  and the capital cost of it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=256.44s)]
*  But that means that essentially the things that kind of generate large earnings for people [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=258.34s)]
*  are not happening anymore. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  Lots of this is just very, very well designed products of which brand naming, marketing, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=267.66s)]
*  making sure that they're okay, all of these things are a huge part of the price. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  And therefore, essentially, if you think of the rest of it, which is a small amount, so [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=278.98s)]
*  that means that if you're a worker, you're getting 40 cents for a $10 toy or something. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=285.94000000000005s)]
*  And that's just not going to make a lot of rich people or even middle class people. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  One of the early papers in your career, you seem to be arguing there was too much petty [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=296.1s)]
*  entrepreneurship in emerging economies. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=300.54s)]
*  Do you think that's still the case? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=303.66s)]
*  And if so, how do those economies make the shift away from that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=305.06s)]
*  I don't see a way for them to make a shift out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=308.26000000000005s)]
*  To be honest, I mean, this is why I think this whole literature on universal basic income [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=311.56s)]
*  and microcredit and all these ways of creating more entrepreneurs. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  In some ways, I think this literature is sort of stuck in this place where they're trying [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=321.66s)]
*  to get most of these petty entrepreneurs to become a little bigger. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=326.3s)]
*  Right now, we don't see a way to do what I think what needs to be done, which is to pick [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  the best among these people and make them much, much bigger. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=336.86s)]
*  Because I think the way petty entrepreneurs have been absorbed into the economy historically [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=340.3s)]
*  have been by making some people being very successful, employing lots of people and creating [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=346.5s)]
*  large enterprises. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=353.34s)]
*  There's very little, I mean, people give the example of Italy, but if you study it carefully, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=355.17999999999995s)]
*  even in Italy, a lot of the reason why the petty entrepreneurs can get somewhere is because [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=361.2s)]
*  there's huge coordination by some brand named, like Benetton being the classic example. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=367.82s)]
*  So it's not obvious to me that there is a, we are right now thinking, even thinking properly [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=374.5s)]
*  about a mechanism for getting the smallest entrepreneurs out of what they're doing and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=380.18s)]
*  into the labor market. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=386.18s)]
*  What do you think is the nature of the positive externality for manufacturing jobs in emerging [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=387.78000000000003s)]
*  economies? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=392.98s)]
*  Where does it come from? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=393.98s)]
*  I don't know that it has to be manufactured. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=394.98s)]
*  That's the part that I, that's I think Danny Roderick's view and something that, as I said, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=397.22s)]
*  I'm quite willing to believe it, but I don't know why it has to be manufactured. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=402.14s)]
*  It seems to me what's, what was important was that it was a set of middle skilled people [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=407.78s)]
*  who could, the skill range in which you could move was still accessible to people who had [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=413.86s)]
*  a poor education. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=419.18s)]
*  The key move was not so much whether it's manufacturing or not, but rather it was, these [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=420.46s)]
*  some skills involved and those skills can be learned and the skills were available to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=428.14s)]
*  people who didn't start with having an excellent education. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=433.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=438.1s)]
*  It could be that manufacturing on top of that has additional benefits. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=439.34s)]
*  That's the part I really don't know how to show or whether I actually believe or not. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=443.9s)]
*  That's a piece where I, it's not that I disbelieve it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=449.94s)]
*  It's not that I have studied it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=452.74s)]
*  It's just not clear to me that there's a reason to think that, you know, if the same options [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=455.1s)]
*  available were available in services, they would not serve for the same purposes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=460.7s)]
*  I just don't know whether that's, either of that is about to happen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=466.34s)]
*  Could you imagine comparable growth to say that of South Korea exporting manufactured [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=470.5s)]
*  goods but through the export of services or is there something different about services [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=475.14s)]
*  that makes that harder? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  Excellent question. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=481.34000000000003s)]
*  I'm slightly out of my depth in all of this because it's not, this is sort of macro trade [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=482.34s)]
*  and macro trade is not exactly my specialization. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=488.5s)]
*  Nonetheless, I would say that prima facie, no, I don't know that there is something [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=492.38s)]
*  that you, you know, a small country exporting lots of services, could it be a location in [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=499.38s)]
*  even a big country like India? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=507.14s)]
*  I mean, the software and after that, the BPO brought in a lot of people who were actually [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=508.9s)]
*  relatively low skilled, who learned English and basically spent a lot of effort. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  There's lots of these classes all over India in small towns, learn English, work for a [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=523.18s)]
*  BPO. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly this idea that, you know, somebody with a high school education, who's [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=530.3s)]
*  smart, who's enterprising, who's willing to work hard can get trained in English, speak [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=534.94s)]
*  like an American, say hello, this is John or whatever you're supposed to say and carry [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=541.1400000000001s)]
*  on a conversation. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=547.58s)]
*  And that training I don't see is any different from the upgrading of a steel worker to a [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=548.58s)]
*  line supervisor. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  I have just, I don't know enough about either of these things, but I would not, it's not [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=556.5400000000001s)]
*  obvious to me that a location or a small country could not get a lot of benefits out [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=562.22s)]
*  of services. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=568.22s)]
*  The problem is more that services are also where automation is hitting. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=569.22s)]
*  You discuss charter cities at some length in your new book. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=573.74s)]
*  Why are you skeptical of them as a way of inducing more economic growth? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=576.94s)]
*  I think that if you could have charter cities, they may very well be great. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=581.02s)]
*  The problem is more, can you believe that the country would honor the particular commitments [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=586.14s)]
*  that it requires? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=593.3s)]
*  So a charter city is the idea that, you know, we are going to hand over the maintenance [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=594.3s)]
*  of our law and order to a different country. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=599.74s)]
*  Somebody else will act as an enforcer. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=604.78s)]
*  I think the democratic process doesn't really, it's very easy to exploit that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=607.62s)]
*  It's very easy to come and say, look, you know, your government has been taken over [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=613.78s)]
*  by these enemy people or these foreign people and they're running, how could they be the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=618.2199999999999s)]
*  people deciding what's legal and what's not, et cetera. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=625.26s)]
*  It's just seen politically extremely unstable, easy to attack, very visible target. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=628.86s)]
*  It's not clear to me that is anything more than that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=634.98s)]
*  I think, yes, if you could imagine a situation where, you know, the politics is exactly aligned [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=637.38s)]
*  right where I would say that creating kind of a legal and physical infrastructure for [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=644.02s)]
*  enterprises would be excellent. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=651.14s)]
*  It's just the idea that this is a country which can't enforce its own laws and therefore [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=654.02s)]
*  outsiders can do it for them. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=659.38s)]
*  There's something in that idea that seems to be odd because it's precisely the fact [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=661.94s)]
*  that this country is not, this country can't enforce its own laws because there's something [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=666.86s)]
*  in this country which is making it hard to enforce those laws. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=671.34s)]
*  And maybe it's competence, but it's not just competence. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=676.02s)]
*  Politically, the opportunities such these things offer are too tempting, it seems to me. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  It seems that British-ruled Hong Kong worked very well. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=686.7s)]
*  Portuguese rule over Goa, much less so. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=689.82s)]
*  How well do you think we understand why some charter cities have gone well and others not? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=692.66s)]
*  I don't think we understand it at all. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=696.86s)]
*  Well, and the reason partly we don't understand is because, you know, is it that Goa was just [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=699.18s)]
*  too near Bombay and that Hong Kong being at that absolutely wonderful spot between, you [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=706.1s)]
*  know, Japan, Korea, and the north of China, India, a lot of opium trade and all of these [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=713.9s)]
*  things went through there. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=721.02s)]
*  So it's like there's tons of, it's, you know, a great place to be an anthropo. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=722.54s)]
*  And I don't know that the world can handle a certain number of successful anthropos. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=728.3s)]
*  Goa may have been too near to Bombay to be a successful anthropo. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=732.94s)]
*  It's not clear that there was a great location. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=736.78s)]
*  So I, again, do I know that that was the reason why Hong Kong was successful in Goa? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=740.02s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=745.94s)]
*  And like there are only 10 examples of very successful anthropos or maybe 15 or 20. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=746.94s)]
*  I don't know the history well enough to say that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=754.7800000000001s)]
*  But it's not that this is Venice for a long time was one and then it stopped. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=756.46s)]
*  And but it was, is it that essentially your location is your ticket to success or is it [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=761.1800000000001s)]
*  something more than that? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=768.5400000000001s)]
*  Can you can you build economies out of anthropos? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=769.94s)]
*  How well do you think economists understand economic growth more generally? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=773.74s)]
*  I think they don't understand it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=777.6600000000001s)]
*  This is the point we make in the book that we really think we, I think we understand [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=779.62s)]
*  some, I think, very basic insights. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=785.34s)]
*  One being, I think the one that my colleague Bob Solow made very clear, which is that growth [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=788.58s)]
*  has a tendency to run out. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=796.58s)]
*  You know, once you used up your best talent and your best capital and your best locations, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=798.1s)]
*  there's going to be less and less so. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=802.98s)]
*  And I think that's probably the only thing I think which has been pretty consistently [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=805.54s)]
*  borne out. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=810.54s)]
*  That fast growth slows down. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=811.54s)]
*  China is slowing now and it's not there's nothing tragic about it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=813.7s)]
*  It's a normal way of things. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=817.7s)]
*  The thing that we don't understand is what makes that happen sooner or later, more or [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=819.34s)]
*  less, et cetera. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=824.74s)]
*  Brazil grew for 20 years extremely fast between 1960 and 1980. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=825.94s)]
*  And then essentially stopped for 20 years. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=832.7s)]
*  Why do those kinds of things happen? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=835.1400000000001s)]
*  That we don't understand. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=837.26s)]
*  I think we are lousy at predicting growth. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=838.26s)]
*  But if we have countries, take Singapore as an example, say they invest heavily in human [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=841.1400000000001s)]
*  capital, they actually have the political will to grow. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=845.86s)]
*  And they very broadly have some kind of neoliberal policies, but tailored to their specifics. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=849.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, don't we know if they do that, they'll grow? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=854.26s)]
*  Singapore, it worked. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=857.0600000000001s)]
*  Dubai, it worked. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=858.0600000000001s)]
*  Republic of Ireland, it worked. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=859.4200000000001s)]
*  Don't we know a lot about growth? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=861.3399999999999s)]
*  Alas, no. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=862.5799999999999s)]
*  I think that, I mean, you have these tiny, tiny, tiny countries basically with, I would [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=863.5799999999999s)]
*  say, very specific political configurations. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=870.78s)]
*  I think Lee Kuan Yew knew very well that if he didn't deliver a very specific set of environmental [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=874.9s)]
*  conditions and was, if he were falling behind, Malaysia around, Singapore was a very, very, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=882.78s)]
*  fragile project in 1960. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=890.62s)]
*  And one that, you know, I think they were lucky to have him as the dictator. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=893.86s)]
*  I think he was, I think, in the end committed to some things which were, but they could [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=900.0200000000001s)]
*  have easily had someone who had crazy views and there were plenty of people with crazy [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=906.74s)]
*  views. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=912.34s)]
*  I think small cities at the edge of other, less liberal societies also are very strange [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=913.46s)]
*  examples to use. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=922.58s)]
*  I would say Dubai, I mean, Dubai is, you see so many people from Saudi Arabia, Iran, et [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=923.58s)]
*  cetera, who need to escape their own societies temporarily for pleasure or for just freedom. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=930.6600000000001s)]
*  I think lots of rich people around, you know, Iraq, Iraq less so. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=936.98s)]
*  I think Iran and Saudi Arabia probably are two big countries with lots of rich people [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=943.02s)]
*  who need a playground. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=947.74s)]
*  I don't know that that's replicable at any scale. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=949.1s)]
*  Why does Kolkata have the best sweet shops in India? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=954.42s)]
*  It's a bit circular because of course I tend to believe Kolkata has. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=957.5s)]
*  So do I, however, and I have no loyalty per se. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=962.26s)]
*  I think largely because Kolkata actually also, which is less known, has absolutely amazing [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=966.5s)]
*  food and in general the food is amazing. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=975.06s)]
*  Having had a very, I mean, relative to the rest of India, Kolkata had a very large middle [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=979.5s)]
*  class who with fair amount of surplus and, you know, and who were willing to spend money [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=988.06s)]
*  on, they didn't, so restaurants were not, I think they were cast and other reasons why [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=996.38s)]
*  restaurants didn't flourish. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1002.38s)]
*  That's sort of like, you know, that's not, is it not an accident that a lot of Indian [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1004.06s)]
*  restaurants were born out of truck stops? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1008.66s)]
*  These are called Thaba's and that those are, the caste has a lot to do with it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1011.66s)]
*  But, you know, sweets are just too difficult to make at home, even though lots of people [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1015.54s)]
*  used to make some of them. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1020.3s)]
*  And I think there was some line that was just permitted that you can have sweets made out [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1021.74s)]
*  of, in these specific places, made by these castes. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1027.66s)]
*  There was all kinds of conversations about this in the early to mid 19th century on what [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1033.22s)]
*  you can eat out, what is eating out, what can you buy in a shop, etc. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1040.3s)]
*  And I think the late 19th century, you see that basically sweet shops are, sweet shops [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1044.98s)]
*  actually provide not just sweets, but for travelers, you can actually eat a lunch there [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1050.66s)]
*  for 50 cents, even now, and excellent lunch, some savories, some, and a sweet, maybe for [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1055.98s)]
*  40 rupees, you get all of that. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1065.46s)]
*  And it was actually the core mechanism for reconciling Brahminical cultures of different [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1068.22s)]
*  kinds with a certain amount of social mobility. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1077.9s)]
*  People came from outside, they were working in Calcutta. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1083.7800000000002s)]
*  Calcutta was a big city in India. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1085.74s)]
*  So all the immigrants came, what would they eat? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1087.7800000000002s)]
*  So I think a lot of these sweet shops were a place where you actually don't just get [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1091.0200000000002s)]
*  sweets, you get savories as well. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1095.34s)]
*  And the savories are excellent. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1097.54s)]
*  In Calcutta, if you go out for the day, the safest place to eat is in a sweet shop. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1099.1s)]
*  There's always freshly made savories available. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1104.86s)]
*  You eat the freshly made savories and you get some sweets at the end. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1108.1s)]
*  Are higher wage rates bad for the highest quality sweets? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1112.02s)]
*  Because rich countries don't seem to have them. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1115.82s)]
*  Oh no, rich countries have fabulous sweets. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1117.46s)]
*  I mean, in France. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1119.86s)]
*  Not like in Calcutta. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1120.86s)]
*  France has fabulous sweets. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1121.86s)]
*  I think the US is exceptional in quality of the, let me say, the fact that you don't get [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1123.46s)]
*  actually excellent sweets in like most places. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1131.74s)]
*  Sure, and hardly anywhere. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1137.42s)]
*  Hardly anywhere. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1138.9s)]
*  You pay extra through your nose, fronts. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1139.9s)]
*  We spend lots of time in a small village in Provence. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1141.74s)]
*  It's a really small village, not one of these villages where whatever, you know, Albert [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1146.46s)]
*  Camus used to live. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1150.3000000000002s)]
*  It's like a no-name village at the edge of the Louberon. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1151.3s)]
*  And the sweet shop there produces better sweets of different kinds than any place in Boston [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1156.02s)]
*  that I would go to. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1165.1399999999999s)]
*  I think just the average quality of what they produce is so wonderful. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1166.82s)]
*  It's a no-name. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1171.6599999999999s)]
*  There are two bakeries. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1172.6599999999999s)]
*  One is cheaper and less good. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1173.6599999999999s)]
*  In a high-end bakery, you pay 10 cents more for a baguette. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1176.38s)]
*  Instead of 95 cents, you pay 1 euro and 5 cents for a baguette or something. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1181.7800000000002s)]
*  And the baguettes are always excellent and the cakes are excellent. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1188.5800000000002s)]
*  I actually think that it's an interesting question why the US is so exceptional in this. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1193.8600000000001s)]
*  In Italy, it's the same. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1199.7s)]
*  I mean, I don't love the bread, but the pastry is excellent in Spain. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1200.7s)]
*  It's the same. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1205.98s)]
*  But are Indian sweets in particular so labor-intensive in their construction that you can't sustain [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1206.98s)]
*  them? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1212.6200000000001s)]
*  No, actually they're not more labor-intensive. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1213.6200000000001s)]
*  I cook a lot. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1214.98s)]
*  I actually can make a fair amount of them. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1216.6200000000001s)]
*  They're not, in a sense, they're somewhat more forgiving than French sweets, which require, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1220.06s)]
*  you know, if you're making a mille-feuille or something, those are extremely labor-intensive [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1226.54s)]
*  and they require extremely mindful labor. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1230.94s)]
*  Indian sweets are actually relatively slow-cooked. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1235.78s)]
*  They don't involve baking, which is the thing that goes wrong because one just sticks it [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1240.34s)]
*  in the oven. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1244.18s)]
*  It's like, God is your only guide. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1245.18s)]
*  And so, whereas I think Indian sweets are relatively forgiving, I prefer, much prefer [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1248.7s)]
*  to make Indian sweets than French sweets. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1254.1s)]
*  So I love cooking and I will make anything if I have the time and mostly because I'm [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1256.5s)]
*  greedy. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1264.1399999999999s)]
*  Which country other than India has the best Indian food? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1265.14s)]
*  Not counting Pakistan or Bangladesh. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1267.74s)]
*  The UK. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1270.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1271.46s)]
*  No question. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1272.46s)]
*  I mean, these days, the best Indian restaurants in the world happen to be in Bangkok. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1273.46s)]
*  And I've not tried Bangkok Indian food because when I go to Bangkok, I want to eat Thai food, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1278.14s)]
*  which is excellent too. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1283.0200000000002s)]
*  But I mean, the UK has excellent, excellent Indian food and trashy and horrible and kind [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1284.7s)]
*  of gloppy, the whole range, but including the high end, which is really quite excellent. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1291.1799999999998s)]
*  There's a long-standing tradition of left-leaning Bengalis being especially important in Indian [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1296.1399999999999s)]
*  intellectual history. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1301.6599999999999s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1303.02s)]
*  I guess why Bengalis? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1304.4599999999998s)]
*  I think again, I think it goes back to the fact that Bengalis were the first group of [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1306.6999999999998s)]
*  people, maybe a little bit with the Parsi's, as being the comprador class, as we Marxists [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1311.3s)]
*  one day, once upon a time used to call them, of the British, the people who worked for [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1318.54s)]
*  the British with the British and made a good living. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1323.5s)]
*  And I think that class very quickly started absorbing English writers and Scottish writers. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1329.62s)]
*  They read, you know, by 1800 already, this is just 25 years after, you're starting to [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1337.7s)]
*  see people who are writing in Bangla about, you know, Hume and about Rousseau. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1344.46s)]
*  They're reading European writers, mostly in English, but they've mastered English. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1351.78s)]
*  They're reading all these things. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1356.38s)]
*  So I think the reason, I think contact with the British created this, I mean, this is [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1357.9s)]
*  very controversial and I'll get killed by many, many people who have strong views on [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1364.26s)]
*  this. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1371.18s)]
*  It's very hard to imagine exactly what happened then. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1373.18s)]
*  Maybe something else could have happened that was wonderful. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1376.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't know the counterfactual. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1378.3400000000001s)]
*  But what happened then was very much people absorbing English 18th century liberal and [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1379.98s)]
*  conservative discourses, using them, this very nice historical, there's a bunch of historians [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1387.8200000000002s)]
*  who studied this period, the 1800 to 1840 in Bengal. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1395.66s)]
*  And it's really fascinating period, like, you know, they're up in arms, they're fighting [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1402.1s)]
*  the Brahminical tradition, the Brahminical tradition is fighting back. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1407.14s)]
*  The first one fact that I like to emphasize is the first, I think, purely secular institution [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1411.82s)]
*  of higher education in the world is in Kolkata. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1420.06s)]
*  In 1817, what now is called Presidency University was set up as Hindu College, but the Hindu [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1424.26s)]
*  College was never for Hindus because the first famous professor there was De Rocio, who was [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1431.82s)]
*  a Christian. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1438.1s)]
*  He was the first and perhaps the most visible sign. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1440.26s)]
*  And it was funded by the Hindu community. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1444.58s)]
*  And the idea was each community will fund one, but in fact, that didn't happen. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1447.3s)]
*  So Hindus, Muslims, Christians, everybody went there. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1451.22s)]
*  This is 1817. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1454.1000000000001s)]
*  Jefferson was very proud of having set up Virginia as a liberal arts university, where [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1455.42s)]
*  the library is the center point. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1463.54s)]
*  That's in 1825. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1465.94s)]
*  So this is eight years before that. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1467.46s)]
*  They already set this up. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1469.98s)]
*  I think this is a moment in history which seems to me comes at the encounter with the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1471.22s)]
*  sense that there is this extremely successful culture out there, whether it is good or bad, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1478.38s)]
*  we don't know. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1487.18s)]
*  And people are saying that. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1488.18s)]
*  I mean, they're writing that we need to know what these bastards are up to or whatever. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1489.18s)]
*  They have their own, they're often quite negative, but they're saying how could we not? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1494.6200000000001s)]
*  They are successful. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1499.5400000000002s)]
*  They're like ruling the world. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1500.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, we really need to know what they're doing. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1501.5400000000002s)]
*  So they start reading up on all this stuff and they're writing about it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1504.42s)]
*  And there's actually by 1820s, actually, even before the 1820s, Ramon Roy was the first, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1508.54s)]
*  I think, great Bengali intellectual who's not, I would say not left leaning. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1516.3000000000002s)]
*  I think he's very- [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1521.3400000000001s)]
*  He was kind of a Benthamite, wasn't he? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1522.3400000000001s)]
*  Benthamite, exactly. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1524.0600000000002s)]
*  Benthamite, but not so much. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1525.0600000000002s)]
*  Bentham is his contemporary of Benthams. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1527.5s)]
*  He dies in 1825 or something. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1529.8200000000002s)]
*  He's a contemporary of Benthams. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1532.9s)]
*  But he's absorbed all this and he writes in Persian a lot because that's the old, he's [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1535.18s)]
*  from the old aristocracy which was trained in Persian. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1542.5s)]
*  But he writes about all these very important liberal ideas. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1546.46s)]
*  He's a liberal in a very important sense in which he's much more than a leftist. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1550.7s)]
*  He's a liberal. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1555.62s)]
*  I think that liberal tradition becomes extremely contentious immediately with the conservatives [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1556.6999999999998s)]
*  pushing back against them. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1565.34s)]
*  And the liberal tradition then has actually a hard time not moving to the left. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1567.1799999999998s)]
*  So it does move to the left, partly because in reaction to a set of reactionary and completely [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1573.06s)]
*  meaningless reactions to the liberal tradition. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1578.86s)]
*  So there were like a bunch of people who, I think you can speak about them in hallowed [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1581.98s)]
*  voices. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1587.06s)]
*  I could talk about them, but their views seem to be mostly, come on, this is foreign stuff, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1588.06s)]
*  we don't like it. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1594.66s)]
*  And so I think the liberal tradition grew partly in reaction to conservative pushback. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1595.74s)]
*  Conservative means conservative, not, I don't mean right or left. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1602.54s)]
*  Conservative pushback. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1606.26s)]
*  Wasn't the first IIT in Bengal, in Kolkata? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1607.26s)]
*  Not in Kolkata, in Kharagpur. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1610.2199999999998s)]
*  Kharagpur, yeah. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1612.86s)]
*  That's about 100 miles from Kolkata. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1613.86s)]
*  But I think those were Nehru already, by this time there is a national plan for these things. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1616.6599999999999s)]
*  And even though the first one gets built, there's one in Bombay, one in Madras, one [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1625.1799999999998s)]
*  in Delhi, one in Kanpur. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1629.82s)]
*  So every part of the country gets one, the first five IITs. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1631.62s)]
*  I think that was already conceived of as a single plan. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1636.06s)]
*  But going back to the question of left, I think the left comes actually later. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1641.02s)]
*  The liberals become left later, partly in reaction to just the horrors of the last years [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1647.98s)]
*  of British rule. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1653.6599999999999s)]
*  I think the partition of Bengal starts the first piece of that in 1905, but most importantly [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1654.6599999999999s)]
*  the Bengal famine just completely moves everybody to the left. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1663.1599999999999s)]
*  Because the Bengal famine in Bengal is seen as being egregious, completely, a callous [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1668.1999999999998s)]
*  government with maybe some sympathy for the people who control the rice supply, created [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1675.0s)]
*  three million people die. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1684.8s)]
*  Churchill sends ships that the Americans had sent with grains to India, sends them, doesn't [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1687.44s)]
*  let them come to India, sends them to help British troops elsewhere. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1694.28s)]
*  And so it creates, I think, an extremely strong basis for the left. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1700.48s)]
*  The left really becomes very powerful starting in the 40s. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1704.56s)]
*  And I think the 40s is, the Bengal famine is a defining event of that period. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1708.92s)]
*  So I think that that's, this is one of the biggest famines ever. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1714.18s)]
*  It's such an egregious tragedy that I think a lot of people just feel that there's something [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1718.6200000000001s)]
*  deeply wrong with the world. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1723.1000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's when the, from Tagore, who's basically a liberal, we move to the [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1725.38s)]
*  left very quickly in the 40s. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1732.72s)]
*  Tagore dies in 41, and after that the Bengalis move quite sharply to the left. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1735.26s)]
*  It started before. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1741.8600000000001s)]
*  It's not that it didn't. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1742.86s)]
*  There was elements of Marxist influence before. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1744.06s)]
*  But I think the general move of Bengali intelligence to the left starts in the 1940s. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1747.28s)]
*  How would you place your own father in the Bengali intellectual tradition? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1754.9799999999998s)]
*  My father was a liberal. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1759.36s)]
*  I think he was not a leftist. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1760.74s)]
*  I would say, you know, relative to the Bengal spectrum at the time, I would say he was on [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1762.76s)]
*  the right. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1767.4599999999998s)]
*  And he was an economist. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1768.4599999999998s)]
*  He was an economist. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1769.4599999999998s)]
*  But I think more importantly for him, in his self-presentation, he was a liberal. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1770.86s)]
*  And he really believed in all the liberal values, freedom of speech. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1776.4599999999998s)]
*  He had self-taught himself British 20th century philosophy quite well. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1782.1999999999998s)]
*  I think it was Russell and G. Moore that he looked up to most. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1790.6599999999999s)]
*  And Russell is left, G. Moore is more center. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1795.6599999999999s)]
*  It's more those that's his that was his intellectual tradition rather than the Marxist tradition. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1800.1s)]
*  I don't think he was he was very much of a much more of a liberal than a leftist. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1805.74s)]
*  Your colleague Dharon Asimoglu in his new book, The Narrow Corridor, argues that the [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1812.06s)]
*  Indian caste system has held back Indian economic growth quite a bit. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1816.58s)]
*  But Pakistan and Bangladesh are poorer than India and don't have a similar caste system. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1821.34s)]
*  Do you have a perspective on this whole debate? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1826.02s)]
*  I think that maybe he's I mean, we don't know the counterfactual. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1828.42s)]
*  Maybe other things went wrong. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1833.22s)]
*  I think suddenly the fact that there was a liberalism that was built into the Nerovian [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1835.3000000000002s)]
*  state encouraged a certain type of person to stay Hindu, Muslim, Christian. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1843.1000000000001s)]
*  And those self-selection was important. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1849.2s)]
*  I don't know what all the ways in which that was these countries are different. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1851.38s)]
*  It's a very interesting thought. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1856.68s)]
*  I don't know whether I actually believe that. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1858.8s)]
*  I certainly believe the caste system is awful. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1862.64s)]
*  I don't know whether I would think it's first order effects are on growth directly or because [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1864.72s)]
*  they just happen to be a way of ethnic organization. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1872.16s)]
*  So I you know, whether without the caste system we would have had like in Pakistan. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1876.4s)]
*  Pakistan is a war zone between the Punjabis, the Pashtuns and the Sindhis. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1882.76s)]
*  The MQM, the kind of the movement of Karachis, exactly the all of these people are fighting [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1888.8799999999999s)]
*  the muhajir, so the people who come from India. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1896.94s)]
*  So it's a bunch of ethnic violence. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1898.96s)]
*  Whether India would have had other axes of violence. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1901.52s)]
*  In a sense, right now the Indian political economy is moving, I would say, a bit in the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1904.36s)]
*  direction of trying to unify the Hindus against everybody. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1909.4s)]
*  Whether that works or not, I don't know. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1913.2s)]
*  I'm not sure whether that's a desirable thing or not. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1914.68s)]
*  I tend to think that diversity is helpful actually. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1918.5600000000002s)]
*  So in some ways I feel that it's not obvious to me that if India was not as, the Hindus [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1923.88s)]
*  were not as divided, India may have gone in a much less liberal direction easily because [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1930.0800000000002s)]
*  there are other minorities and it could have been anti, much more organized and anti minority [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1937.12s)]
*  lines. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1941.6799999999998s)]
*  Part of the division, the fact that the schedule caste don't trust the upper caste, it might [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1942.6s)]
*  actually be a way of creating enough countervailing power if you like. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1947.48s)]
*  So kind of stabilizing property in the short run at least. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1952.74s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not obvious to me that where, what the counterfactual is. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1956.32s)]
*  That's the point I'm making. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1962.56s)]
*  If I look at the earlier history of Indian classical music in Bengal, two outsiders, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1964.48s)]
*  Ravi Shankar is best known, but there are many top performers and more recently Bengal [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1970.48s)]
*  in Indian classical music seems to be less important. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1975.72s)]
*  Do you agree and if so, why is that? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1978.32s)]
*  Well, I think Bengal was never the place for vocal. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1980.4s)]
*  So as a real addict of vocal Indian classical music, I would say if you look at the list [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1984.92s)]
*  of the top performers in vocal Indian classical music, no one really is a Bengali. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1990.84s)]
*  In instrumental Bengal was always very strong. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=1998.52s)]
*  Right now, one of the best vocalists in India is a man who lives in Kolkata. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2003.52s)]
*  His name is Rashid Khan. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2011.52s)]
*  He's absolutely fabulous in my view. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2013.16s)]
*  Maybe the best on a good day is the best that there is. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2015.4s)]
*  He's not a Bengali. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2019.3600000000001s)]
*  He's from Bihar, I think, and he comes and settles in Kolkata. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2020.48s)]
*  He's, I think, a Hindi speaker by birth rather than a Bengali. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2023.88s)]
*  So I don't think Bengal ever had top vocalists. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2028.2s)]
*  It had top instrumentalists and Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, Nikhil Banerjee. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2031.2s)]
*  These were all Bengali instrumentalists. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2036.8000000000002s)]
*  And if even now I would say the best instrumentalists, a lot of them are either Bengali [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2039.96s)]
*  or a few of them are second, you know, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2046.32s)]
*  Vilayat Khan and Ish and Imrat Khan were the two great [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2050.32s)]
*  non-Bengali instrumentalists of that period, I would say. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2055.72s)]
*  And they both settled in Kolkata. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2060.72s)]
*  So the children grew up in Kolkata and they are the other great instrumentalists are these [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2063.2s)]
*  Kolkata born. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2072.2s)]
*  They went to the same high school as I did. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2074.0s)]
*  They were this, they Kolkata born not of Bengali families, but from very much the same culture. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2076.2s)]
*  So I think Kolkata still is the place which produces the best instrumentalists. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2082.0s)]
*  Why is the better vocal music so often from the South? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2087.48s)]
*  Oh, that's a separate question. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2091.0s)]
*  The South is actually has its own vocal tradition, which is completely different. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2092.48s)]
*  I actually don't know enough about it to say. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2097.04s)]
*  I think the best vocalists typically right now come from Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2100.12s)]
*  That's sort of this middle South West. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2106.52s)]
*  But the deep South has a completely different tradition. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2111.64s)]
*  They sing in entirely different ways. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2115.68s)]
*  The tradition that I listen a lot to is the tradition of Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2118.0s)]
*  And that's where, to me, in my mind, the great home of classical vocal music right now is [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2128.6s)]
*  that part of India, the area kind of starting at Bombay, going down to Bangalore. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2134.36s)]
*  That chunk of India is where the great classical musicians are. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2141.8399999999997s)]
*  Like Pandit Kumar. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2146.4s)]
*  Yes, or certainly Venkatesh Kumar, but also I'm going to blank on the name of this young [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2147.8399999999997s)]
*  woman artist who I just heard, who I thought was just fabulous. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2154.76s)]
*  Amankari? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2158.5600000000004s)]
*  She's not young anymore? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2159.5600000000004s)]
*  No, no. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2160.5600000000004s)]
*  She died. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2161.5600000000004s)]
*  Kishori Amankari. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2162.5600000000004s)]
*  She died a few years ago. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2163.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2165.6400000000003s)]
*  She was the best, I think. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2167.32s)]
*  I would say, I mean, I heard her a few times live and when she sang well, I don't think [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2169.6400000000003s)]
*  anybody, she had a way of completely, I mean, I think what is difficult in Indian classical [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2174.92s)]
*  music is to keep the variation going and keep the musicality running. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2182.08s)]
*  And some people do lots of variation, but they lose the sense of the overall music. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2187.64s)]
*  She was amazing. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2192.6s)]
*  At her best, and in fact, I heard her first time live at Harvard when we were students [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2194.48s)]
*  together in 1985. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2200.6s)]
*  And she sang an unbelievable concert in the old Fogg Museum courtyard. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2202.56s)]
*  It was probably the best concert I ever heard. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2207.92s)]
*  But no, much younger women who are in their 30s, there are really some very talented ones, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  but I can't remember their names right now. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2218.32s)]
*  They are, I'm blanking on their names. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2221.2000000000003s)]
*  I can, I would remember them as soon as I walk out of the room, but there's actually [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2226.28s)]
*  lots of talented people in their 30s, 40s. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2229.92s)]
*  That's Indian classical music being the kind of thing it is. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2234.44s)]
*  You never become a top artist till you are in your late 30s or something. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2238.0s)]
*  Do the economics of Indian classical music have a future? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2242.88s)]
*  I think so. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that... [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2247.2400000000002s)]
*  But through concertizing or overseas work or how? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2249.08s)]
*  I think through concertizing. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2253.64s)]
*  I do think that if you look at the top echelon of these people, their fees have gone up a [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2255.12s)]
*  lot and they're in demand. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2261.68s)]
*  I think that it's not clear to me that this is any worse than it ever was. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2264.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's always a little bit of a, you have to do it if you love it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2271.0s)]
*  You don't do it because you're going to make money. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2274.3599999999997s)]
*  And the movie industry has always been quite generous. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2276.52s)]
*  I mean, Ravishankar also was a music director for many films and he composed music for many [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2280.04s)]
*  films, et cetera. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2286.88s)]
*  So Bollywood is actually a pretty good client for good classical musicians. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2288.6400000000003s)]
*  And Bollywood is one of, I think, India's great successes. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2297.2400000000002s)]
*  With the tradition of training Indian classical musicians through the family, being passed [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  down father to son, will that persist or is that an anachronism? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2305.44s)]
*  I think that's an anachronism. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2308.7200000000003s)]
*  I think that training schools like SRA in Kolkata are very good. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2310.12s)]
*  They train you, make you listen to many different people. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2315.12s)]
*  And I think that that's actually a good thing for musicians to learn how to distinguish [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2318.56s)]
*  their tradition from other people's tradition. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2325.6s)]
*  I think that the old norms were a little bit too parochial. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2327.96s)]
*  Now, in the middle of these conversations, we usually have a segment, underrated versus [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2333.0s)]
*  overrated. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2337.48s)]
*  I'll toss out some names, some ideas, and you say if you think they're underrated or [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2338.48s)]
*  overrated. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2342.48s)]
*  But of course, feel free to pass. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2343.48s)]
*  First one, Balzac. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2345.72s)]
*  I think rated about right. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2346.72s)]
*  I think Balzac is great. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2349.48s)]
*  I don't think in France anybody doubts that he's great. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2351.8s)]
*  So he's sort of the canon. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2355.52s)]
*  So I think he's not overrated or underrated. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2357.58s)]
*  Experimental economics. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2362.04s)]
*  Underrated. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2363.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2364.04s)]
*  I think people haven't quite understood how much, how well it connects to the rest of [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2365.04s)]
*  economics. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2371.72s)]
*  That seems to me that people think that this is some boutique exercise that's happening [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2373.68s)]
*  elsewhere. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2377.9199999999996s)]
*  But in fact, it's changing economics. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2378.9199999999996s)]
*  It's changing the way we do theory and changing the way we do policy analysis and the way [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2380.7599999999998s)]
*  we think about the world. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2387.7599999999998s)]
*  Tolstoy. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2389.56s)]
*  I think rated about right again. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2390.56s)]
*  I don't think Tolstoy. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2393.0s)]
*  I mean, I think Tolstoy is wonderful, but I think people think he's wonderful. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2394.0s)]
*  They don't read him, but that's a separate question. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2398.0s)]
*  Is he rated high? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2401.72s)]
*  Yes, sure he's rated high. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2402.72s)]
*  He's the canon. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2403.8799999999997s)]
*  The Beatles. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2404.8799999999997s)]
*  Underrated or overrated? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2405.8799999999997s)]
*  Neither. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2407.8799999999997s)]
*  They're the canon. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2408.8799999999997s)]
*  They're the canon. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2409.8799999999997s)]
*  Economic growth prospects for Pakistan. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2412.0s)]
*  It seems to me 30 years behind India. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2414.0s)]
*  Will it catch up, converge or not? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2416.04s)]
*  I don't know enough to. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2418.04s)]
*  I mean, it's growing fine. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2419.6s)]
*  It's actually doing fine. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2421.08s)]
*  And you know, Indian growth is a bit faltering, so maybe it'll catch up. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2422.3199999999997s)]
*  But it just, I don't know. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2426.52s)]
*  I wish I knew more about what makes Pakistan grow. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2428.04s)]
*  I mean, after all, it still grows at 6%, which is not nothing. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2431.48s)]
*  So I feel like, you know, who are we to sniff at 6% for many, many years? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2435.2400000000002s)]
*  It's been growing at 6%. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2441.28s)]
*  It's not, it's not, that's not nothing to laugh at. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2442.8s)]
*  Who is an underrated Indian writer of importance to you? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2447.2400000000002s)]
*  Any number of the vernacular writers who are not read, I would say, among novelists, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2452.84s)]
*  I only really read Mangala but Salsies. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2460.6400000000003s)]
*  But that's not because, that's not to say that there aren't other similar people in [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2463.76s)]
*  other languages. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2467.4s)]
*  But Bivyutipashana, Bhushana Bandabadhaya, Tara Shankar Bandabadhaya, Manik Bandabadhaya, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2468.56s)]
*  Shatinath Bhaduri, they're just amazingly good novel form literature from the 20s to [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2477.68s)]
*  the 70s and also amazingly good poetry, both of which I think are just not read by anybody. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2487.04s)]
*  Is it translatable into English? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2497.2s)]
*  Yes, it is translated even, some of it. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2499.0s)]
*  But it can be translated but not translatable, so to speak. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2501.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's translatable. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2504.9599999999996s)]
*  I do think that it needs somebody with lots of talent to do it and somehow that incentive [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2506.4s)]
*  hasn't, I think now there's a little more interest in doing it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2512.4s)]
*  In fact, Penguin has a series where they try to publish high profile translations. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2516.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think we give it incentives. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2521.1200000000003s)]
*  I think there is just so much great literature. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2523.52s)]
*  Other than Bengali food, what do you think is the best Indian regional cuisine? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2527.48s)]
*  For me, it's food of Chennai, but… [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2531.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean, there are only, in my mind, only two competitions. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2533.72s)]
*  The competition is either Chennai or Hyderabad. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2538.8399999999997s)]
*  I think Hyderabad has an even broader range of food in the sense that it goes from very [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2540.9599999999996s)]
*  meat based and different styles of meat based, the kind of the Hyderabad, the Nawabi cuisine. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2547.6s)]
*  Andhra Pradesh is full of people who are sort of not vegetarian, the Hindu, not vegetarian. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2555.72s)]
*  They eat lots of meat. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2563.9599999999996s)]
*  The South actually is where meat eating is more common than in the North. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2564.9599999999996s)]
*  It's bizarrely enough though we associate the South with vegetarian food. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2569.3199999999997s)]
*  And Andhra Pradesh has fabulous food of across the range. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2573.56s)]
*  I mean, if you go to small towns in Andhra Pradesh, the meat, the vegetables, everything [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2576.3199999999997s)]
*  is stunningly good. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2580.3199999999997s)]
*  Fish is stunningly good. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2581.8399999999997s)]
*  So I would have picked Andhra Pradesh, but Tamil Nadu being the other possible. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2583.4s)]
*  Tamil Nadu is where Chennai is. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2589.12s)]
*  Those are the two… [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2592.12s)]
*  Tamil Nadu also has enormous variety, again going from meat, chutney nut food, all the [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2593.12s)]
*  way to very, very proper vegetarian food and all that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2598.8s)]
*  It's really great. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2603.6s)]
*  I mean, that part of the South, the Eastern South has great food. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2604.6s)]
*  Why is the quality of vegetables so much higher in India than anywhere else? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2611.48s)]
*  Vegetable cooking. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2616.2400000000002s)]
*  Cooking, but the vegetables themselves. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2617.2400000000002s)]
*  If you eat a fairly plain dish, it's still wonderful. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2618.56s)]
*  I think partly… [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2621.28s)]
*  Short supply chain or… [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2622.28s)]
*  Yeah, short supply chain. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2623.44s)]
*  I mean, even now people really pull out the vegetables in the morning and bring them to [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2624.44s)]
*  the market. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2629.76s)]
*  If you go to like the Garihat Market in Kolkata, there's this part of Garihat Market where [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2630.76s)]
*  Basically old ladies whose sons have sent them from their village to vend the okra that [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2636.72s)]
*  they've picked this morning. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2644.48s)]
*  I mean, just freshness is such an enormous part of taste. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2645.7599999999998s)]
*  And also not designing food for durability. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2650.48s)]
*  In the U.S., tomatoes are designed for durability, and that takes away from other things. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2654.72s)]
*  Johann Sebastian Bach, the Cantatas, overrated or underrated? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2662.16s)]
*  My wife will kill me, but I'll say overrated. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2665.7999999999997s)]
*  Boring. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2669.52s)]
*  You have a 2015 science paper with Esther, Dean Carlin, some other co-authors, about [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2670.7599999999998s)]
*  how cash transfers to the poor combined with training and coaching have very high rates [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2675.3999999999996s)]
*  of return. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2680.04s)]
*  Over 100%, up to 433%. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2681.3999999999996s)]
*  What exactly do you think the coaching is adding in those RCTs? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2684.8799999999997s)]
*  So these people, we've actually done it without the coaching in Ghana, and it doesn't work. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2689.08s)]
*  So we are reasonably confident that the coaching is doing something interesting. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2694.96s)]
*  I wouldn't say it does it necessarily for everybody, but the people targeted in this [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2699.52s)]
*  are the poorest of the poor. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2704.04s)]
*  They're among the poor, the people who are really, and for them I think confidence is [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2706.16s)]
*  an enormous issue because they've never actually done anything in their life successfully. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2710.88s)]
*  They've been living hand to mouth, usually begging from people, getting some help. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2715.4s)]
*  And what that does to your self-confidence, your sense of who you are, I think those things [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2721.48s)]
*  we haven't even documented how brutal it is to be really, you know, people who treat [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2727.28s)]
*  you with a little bit of contempt, they might help you with the treat you with a little [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2733.8s)]
*  bit of contempt as well. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2736.84s)]
*  This is the kind of people, I mean, at least the one that I was, big part of studying was [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2739.4s)]
*  the one in India and also one in Ghana, especially the one in Bengal. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2744.72s)]
*  And these women, they lived in, I mean, they were living in places where nobody should [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2749.04s)]
*  live. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2753.64s)]
*  They had, you know, one said, oh, we get snakes all the time. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2754.64s)]
*  Another one said, you know, I had to, I'm now vending knickknacks in the village, or [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2757.74s)]
*  basically cheap stone jewelry or plastic jewelry. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2762.92s)]
*  Before I, the people from this NGO showed me where the market was to buy wholesale. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2767.68s)]
*  I had never taken a bus, so I had no idea how to go there. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2773.96s)]
*  So they had to literally put me on a bus, show me where to get off. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2777.76s)]
*  And it took a couple of times because I had never taken a bus. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2781.84s)]
*  I didn't know whether, you know, I couldn't read. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2784.6800000000003s)]
*  So if it's a number X bus, number, I don't know what X is. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2787.6400000000003s)]
*  So how would I know I'm getting on the right bus? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2791.52s)]
*  So all of these things are, you know, if you start from a place where you really never [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2793.6s)]
*  had a chance, I think it's useful to have some confidence building. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2798.0s)]
*  You can do it too. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2802.96s)]
*  There's nothing difficult about it. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2803.96s)]
*  So do you think the coaching almost serves as a kind of placebo? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2805.68s)]
*  You don't have to teach them so much, but just show that someone else has confidence [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2809.04s)]
*  in them? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2813.16s)]
*  I think that's an interesting question. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2814.16s)]
*  I think it's a bit more than that. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2816.32s)]
*  It's also saying, you can do it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2818.0s)]
*  And here are the steps. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2820.68s)]
*  I think turning things into a set of processes is important. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2821.7200000000003s)]
*  Otherwise, it looks like an unlikely proposition that I can do it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2825.92s)]
*  I've never done it. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2831.64s)]
*  I've never bought and sold things. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2832.64s)]
*  In fact, I've never sold anything. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2834.8799999999997s)]
*  And how do I do it? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2837.56s)]
*  I think it's a matter of it's a bit more than that. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2839.04s)]
*  I think setting, turning things into process is important also, you know, that here is [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2841.16s)]
*  how you get on a bus. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2846.92s)]
*  You go there, you pay this much money, they give you something, you bring it back. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2848.58s)]
*  I think one of the things they're doing is also turning it into a set of procedural steps, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2852.72s)]
*  which is very different from saying, go do that. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2858.24s)]
*  How scalable do you think the coaching is? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2861.64s)]
*  It's scalable. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2863.92s)]
*  I don't think it's difficult. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2865.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it will need a change in... [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2866.68s)]
*  I think one thing this organization does well is it teaches people to be quite sympathetic [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2870.68s)]
*  to the one we worked with in Bengal, the one I know well. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2876.56s)]
*  And they were just, I think the people we worked with were basically able to be sympathetic. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2879.7999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't take much. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2886.08s)]
*  It takes sympathy. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2887.08s)]
*  But I think it's a matter of motivating people to do it, making sure that they feel... [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2888.72s)]
*  I mean, there are lots of people who work for NGOs after all. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2893.72s)]
*  And they're often people who want to do things for the world who are positive people. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2896.64s)]
*  So I don't imagine it being that difficult. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it will require investment in training a particular kind of person. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2906.3199999999997s)]
*  But I don't know that it's any different from training somebody for, you know, collecting [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2910.9599999999996s)]
*  money in a microfinance organization. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2916.98s)]
*  It's the same level of skill, the same kind of person, same set of places where these [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2918.78s)]
*  people will come out of. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2924.7000000000003s)]
*  So this seemed to work in six countries, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, Peru, as [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2926.1400000000003s)]
*  you well know. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2931.1000000000004s)]
*  Why isn't the whole world doing this? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2932.1000000000004s)]
*  I think lots of people are. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2933.42s)]
*  I think somebody told me 43 different countries, they are experimenting with it. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2935.38s)]
*  I think this is the next stage where I think we are a bit proselytizers for this and we [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2940.42s)]
*  get called in. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2946.14s)]
*  But actually, the story is kind of doing the rounds. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2947.14s)]
*  The governments, many state governments in India now want to just do it. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2950.3799999999997s)]
*  And that's my exposure. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2954.14s)]
*  In fact, today, we were in a part of a long email exchange on exactly how it should be [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2955.58s)]
*  done in the state of Orissa in the east of India that wants to do it. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2961.54s)]
*  So I think it's having some traction. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2966.2599999999998s)]
*  Your randomized control trials, they're huge. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2969.02s)]
*  They employ large numbers of people. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2971.22s)]
*  Do you have a personal philosophy on management or leadership? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2973.42s)]
*  What have you learned? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2976.54s)]
*  So you started as an academic and now you run big things. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2977.54s)]
*  I'm a lousy manager. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2981.02s)]
*  I can't be, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2982.46s)]
*  Well, I think I can be because I have lots of faith in people and I'm good, I believe, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2984.82s)]
*  in giving responsibility to the right people. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2992.7400000000002s)]
*  That makes you an excellent manager. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2995.78s)]
*  I'm only good at that, but I do go long on both investing in those people, making friends [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=2997.34s)]
*  with those people, enjoying their company, and letting them tell me when things are going [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3004.6200000000003s)]
*  wrong and advise me when I'm thinking wrong. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3010.98s)]
*  So I feel I get a great deal out of working with wonderful, brilliant people. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3015.38s)]
*  J-PAL is full of such people. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3021.46s)]
*  How many consumer loyalty programs do you belong to? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3023.5s)]
*  Two, I think. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3026.62s)]
*  And you still think they're collusive? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3027.62s)]
*  Yeah, the fact that I belong to it in equilibrium, I should belong to it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3029.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3035.1s)]
*  I think that the airlines are completely turning the screws on you. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3036.1s)]
*  Do you think there's a regulatory solution? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3042.94s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3045.38s)]
*  It's not clear to me that the welfare losses are that large. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3046.38s)]
*  In a sense, the airline industry is, the problem of the airline industry is also this, you [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3049.34s)]
*  know what, in economics we were taught as Bertrand Edgeworth competition. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3054.94s)]
*  You pay your fixed cost and then you compete the others. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3059.78s)]
*  So it's known to be unstable. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3063.66s)]
*  We knew, we were taught that. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3065.7000000000003s)]
*  You and I were taught that by Andreu, that they were unstable. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3067.82s)]
*  And I see the airlines industry as being, the first order problem in the airline industry [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3072.34s)]
*  is that, which is that it is designed to be unstable. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3076.1s)]
*  The marginal costs become very low. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3079.2200000000003s)]
*  You make a big investment, then you drive everybody else out. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3081.26s)]
*  Then of course the prices go up. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3084.9s)]
*  You see absolutely the Bertrand Edgeworth pattern. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3087.42s)]
*  And you're seeing it right now in India, where a bunch of airlines are going out of business [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3090.42s)]
*  because the prices were just too low at some level. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3095.2200000000003s)]
*  The competition was too hard and Jet Airways has gone in and Kingfish has gone in India's [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3099.14s)]
*  basically now down to three and a half airlines. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3104.26s)]
*  You have a 1999 QJA paper with Aghion and Thomas Piketty. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3107.7400000000002s)]
*  It seems to be an early precursor of secular stagnation theories. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3113.02s)]
*  Do you still think about this issue? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3116.1s)]
*  Yeah, I like that paper. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3117.78s)]
*  I think it was a little too maybe cutesy for the macro people to like it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3119.18s)]
*  They like like properly, you know, all the bells and whistles that make macro models, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3124.22s)]
*  they like it. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3130.18s)]
*  We went for a very different idea. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3131.9s)]
*  We were basically theorists. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3134.2599999999998s)]
*  So we're trained to write models that just deliver what you want it to deliver and not [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3136.1s)]
*  much else. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3140.3s)]
*  So in that sense, I'm very proud of that paper. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3141.38s)]
*  I think it's a good exercise. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3144.02s)]
*  It never flew because I think people really wanted the bells and whistles that we didn't [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3146.1600000000003s)]
*  really provide. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3152.46s)]
*  I think Paul Krugman for a while did some advertising of not that paper, but the sequel [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3153.46s)]
*  of that paper, which was on open economies. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3160.2200000000003s)]
*  But I think most people, the most macro people, real macro people didn't see it as being, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3163.6200000000003s)]
*  they thought it was too toy. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3171.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you miss being a theorist? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3172.66s)]
*  Or maybe you still do theory in secret? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3175.46s)]
*  No, not even in secret. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3177.2599999999998s)]
*  I have a recent, I mean, it's more that I do theory on and things that in a sense, I [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3178.98s)]
*  was doing 30 years ago in social learning. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3186.58s)]
*  So doing theory, but maybe a little more inspired by behavioral economics, a little bit inspired [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3188.58s)]
*  by the fact that maybe people don't make rational choices, but have a 2019 paper on how people [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3195.62s)]
*  choose good rules for social learning. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3203.62s)]
*  What are good rules for social learning? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3207.94s)]
*  Will people choose them? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3209.7799999999997s)]
*  What's the story of how you came around to doing randomized controlled trials, having [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3211.34s)]
*  started off writing with Eric Maskin, right? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3215.3s)]
*  He was your supervisor. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3217.9s)]
*  He was my supervisor. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3218.9s)]
*  I think randomized controlled trials are, in a sense, they appeal very much to a theorist, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3219.98s)]
*  I would say, because what's nice about them, and that's what I always tell people, is that [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3226.38s)]
*  it's really not about getting unbiased estimates. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3231.7s)]
*  That's a sort of a red herring. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3236.62s)]
*  Maybe you can get unbiased estimates in many different ways. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3238.58s)]
*  What you can't do is design your treatment to follow what's inside your head. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3241.58s)]
*  I think what's very nice about randomized controlled trials and what made me is to say [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3248.06s)]
*  that, look, if I want to keep digging into something, why is it not working? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3253.1s)]
*  I can keep varying the treatment exactly based on my current hypothesis. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3258.42s)]
*  In some ways, I think this process of working on it has even more convinced me that this [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3263.9s)]
*  idea that we're going to do theory, which is place and time independent, is not helpful [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3270.5s)]
*  I think what's the best thing about economics is that it gives you a toolkit. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3278.02s)]
*  You interrogate things and you say, oh, well, it couldn't be that. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3282.14s)]
*  It couldn't be that. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3284.7s)]
*  Could it be this? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3285.7s)]
*  And that training that we get, which is an excellent training of thinking through multiple [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3286.7s)]
*  hypotheses, that's what theory is about, is in a sense building ways to accommodate multiple [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3291.8999999999996s)]
*  hypotheses into the sparest narrative possible. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3299.62s)]
*  You want to see if these two forces are going to, which of them win out under certain conditions. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3303.06s)]
*  That kind of thing is great because it trains you to think about all the forces at play [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3309.14s)]
*  in a particular context. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3313.46s)]
*  I think of economics as theory as being excellent training for the mind. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3316.1s)]
*  It gives you a way to ask, I think it's this, but could it be that? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3321.18s)]
*  That training, I think, is still what makes me excited to when I think about a new RCT. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3327.38s)]
*  I think about maybe we can try this, maybe we can try that. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3333.2200000000003s)]
*  Now I'm more, I teach PhD behavioral economics, so I've been educating myself in those things. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3336.9s)]
*  So the hypothesis set are maybe a bit wider, but the same idea, which is that theory trains [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3344.2200000000003s)]
*  you to ask questions about what you could get wrong or where you could get confused [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3350.6600000000003s)]
*  or how to interpret a particular fact. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3356.78s)]
*  Maybe I think naively that this means that, but it's not actually because you think about it. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3358.94s)]
*  And that was the great insight, I think, of the Chicago tradition. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3364.1400000000003s)]
*  I think they used it often maybe to defend the status quo, but I don't think the insight [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3367.26s)]
*  was not wrong. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3372.5s)]
*  I think the way they used theory was very, very appropriate, which is to be interrogative. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3373.86s)]
*  How should we reform graduate training in economics? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3379.1400000000003s)]
*  We're trying very hard at MIT. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3382.38s)]
*  I was on a committee which recommended that we get rid of the general exam and we just [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3385.06s)]
*  instead have much more encouragement to start doing research early. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3392.98s)]
*  I do feel that we sort of stun people with this much theory and this much macro is essential. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3396.98s)]
*  And often don't, and there's so much, we teach them so much that they don't learn anything [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3405.14s)]
*  or they don't know enough. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3410.7s)]
*  Because I think some level what maybe we got by having been at an early point is that we [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3412.22s)]
*  got a lot of portable insights. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3420.1s)]
*  And portable is the key word, which is that you want to take the insight and apply it [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3422.3799999999997s)]
*  to something immediately rather than sort of know that, yes, there is this enormous [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3426.2599999999998s)]
*  edifice and the edifice can be built. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3433.4199999999996s)]
*  That to me is less useful than knowing how the insight of why complete markets deliver [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3436.98s)]
*  efficiency, understanding that is very useful, not because it describes the world, but because [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3446.3s)]
*  it gives you a very clear understanding of what is going wrong. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3451.7400000000002s)]
*  And we don't teach it as such. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3456.98s)]
*  We teach it as here is a theorem about the world. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3458.3s)]
*  We don't teach people to wonder about here are 17 examples. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3461.14s)]
*  What's going wrong in this one? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3467.2999999999997s)]
*  Spot the place where the assumptions are failing. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3469.5s)]
*  What's incomplete in this market and why is it that, why does that potentially have big [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3473.74s)]
*  effects? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3480.06s)]
*  I don't think we do a good job of making these things kind of get them under people's skin [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3481.06s)]
*  so that they feel that, OK, I understand not just the theorem, which I can write down [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3487.5s)]
*  and prove, but also that this is if I had to take it in my hand and use it to analyze [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3493.52s)]
*  a particular question, I'll feel confident in doing that. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3499.06s)]
*  What did you learn from Eric Maskin, your doctoral supervisor? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3502.88s)]
*  I had two actually. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3505.66s)]
*  Eric Maskin and an even maybe more pure theorist, Andreo Mascalele. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3507.22s)]
*  Two absolutely fabulous supervisors. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3514.22s)]
*  I can't imagine having better. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3516.58s)]
*  What I learned was from I think both of them and especially I think from Eric, it's more [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3518.7s)]
*  Eric is interested in the world. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3524.56s)]
*  Andreo also actually eventually went into politics, but at that time he didn't. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3526.62s)]
*  But what he did was he taught us that in the end, there's lots of verbiage and there's [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3531.3599999999997s)]
*  a few ideas that are key. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3539.4199999999996s)]
*  Just focus on that. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3542.02s)]
*  And he would almost when he would teach his advanced course, I don't know if you took [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3543.02s)]
*  one, he would just draw a picture and say that, look, this picture contains all the [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3546.74s)]
*  things that can go wrong. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3551.1s)]
*  And this whole theorem is to show you conditions under which this doesn't happen. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3553.18s)]
*  Think about the picture and you are in a sense that I always think of that as being the key [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3558.92s)]
*  thing that I learned from both of them, which is have the discipline to pinpoint. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3564.38s)]
*  Don't get lost in the complexity. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3568.82s)]
*  The complexity is often manmade and sometimes unnecessary. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3570.22s)]
*  Find the key place where the argument is failing or what gives leverage to the argument in [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3574.8599999999997s)]
*  both directions. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3581.4599999999996s)]
*  And that's what I learned. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3583.4199999999996s)]
*  I think it's a fabulous way to be trained. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3584.66s)]
*  With Eric, it's unnerving in a sense because he is so sharp. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3587.62s)]
*  If you say something that's, you know, there's three extra pieces to the argument which are [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3591.8599999999997s)]
*  not needed, he'll spot them immediately. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3597.4199999999996s)]
*  So you get trained to say that, look, this is the key point. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3600.14s)]
*  The rest of it is we can build the infrastructure over it, but it's not going to change the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3603.8199999999997s)]
*  core insight. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3609.74s)]
*  What did you learn from your mother? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3610.74s)]
*  To be angry about things that are wrong in society. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3612.2599999999998s)]
*  My mother is very passionate and she will just, you know, go on a tirade. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3616.18s)]
*  Even now, she goes on a tirade about all kinds of things that she thinks are wrong. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3623.14s)]
*  And in a sense, her passion is not unrelated to the economics. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3628.42s)]
*  She thinks of the economics and says, but this economics is kind of backwards. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3633.26s)]
*  That you know, it can't possibly be that this is what the market needs to do to function. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3637.98s)]
*  So where is it going wrong? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3643.6600000000003s)]
*  She doesn't necessarily always articulate the whole thought, but her passion combined [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3646.1s)]
*  with a sudden commitment to kind of thinking it through, I think is, she's just a fabulous [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3652.7s)]
*  example for growing up. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3659.98s)]
*  I mean, she was never, she would never be kind of passive about the bad things that [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3662.2599999999998s)]
*  are happening in the world. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3669.06s)]
*  And last question, what did you learn from your father? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3670.58s)]
*  To listen carefully to other people's arguments and try to see what they're saying. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3673.3399999999997s)]
*  Before you dismiss them, be mindful that they have thought about it, be respectful of what [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3680.66s)]
*  the argument is and kind of unwind it carefully. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3687.94s)]
*  He was ruthless about unwinding bad arguments, but he would do it in a way that's funny and [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3691.8599999999997s)]
*  non-confrontational. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3698.74s)]
*  And I try, but I'm not as good as he is. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3700.58s)]
*  Abhijit, thank you very much. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBUWjVJIBRo&t=3702.74s)]
