Video Description: When the audience for visual art expanded from small circles of artists and collectors into broader culture, the way art was experienced shifted from aesthetics to explanation. Art, it became thought, should be about something. But David Salle rebukes this literal-mindedness: according to him, what we think and feel when reacting to a piece of art is more authoritative than what’s written on the label next to it. A painter, sculptor, and filmmaker, David is also the author of How to See: Looking, Talking, and Thinking about Art, a highly regarded book on artistic criticism. 

David joined Tyler to discuss the fifteen (or so) functions of good art, why it’s easier to write about money than art, what’s gone wrong with art criticism today, how to cultivate good taste, the reasons museum curators tend to be risk-averse, the effect of modern artistic training on contemporary art, the evolution of Cézanne, how the centrality of photography is changing fine art, what makes some artists’ retrospectives more compelling than others, the physical challenges of painting on a large scale, how artists view museums differently, how a painting goes wrong, where his paintings end up, what great collectors have in common, how artists collect art differently, why Frank O’Hara was so important to Alex Katz and himself, what he loves about the films of Preston Sturges, why The Sopranos is a model of artistic expression, how we should change intellectual property law for artists, the disappointing puritanism of the avant-garde, and more.

# David Salle on the Experience of Art  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 03, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbhjEKLkfqE)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler. Today I'm honored to be sitting
*  here with David Sally in David's studio out on Long Island. David I would describe really
*  as a force of nature. He has spent most of his life creating art, often as a painter
*  but not only. Also sculpture, film. He directed a movie produced by Martin Scorsese. David
*  is perhaps best known for his rise to fame in the 1980s where he heralded the revival
*  of a certain style of figurative painting. David is someone who is thought of as being
*  able to work in ballet and theater in virtually every genre and being able to integrate disparate
*  elements of the artistic craft, figure out how they work. He has also written a highly
*  regarded book of artistic criticism called How to See, is working on a memoir, has three
*  shows coming up this fall and you can think of David as someone who has done virtually
*  everything. He has in fact also interviewed Scarlett Johansson. David welcome. Thank you
*  very much Tyler, very happy to be here. Let me start with a few quotations from you and
*  I'll read them off and you tell me what you meant okay. Here's the first one quote, it
*  sounds strident but I feel my whole career represents my stand against or an alternative
*  to literal mindedness. I think it's kind of true. What does it mean? It's certainly nothing
*  particular to me or rather not only to me. However, I feel that from starting from when
*  I don't know from the 50s or the 60s or 70s at a certain point the experience of culture
*  whether it's painting or something else shifted, the nature of the experience shifted to something
*  that had more in common with journalism than with what we might call the quote unquote
*  an aesthetic experience. That works of art were thought to be about something and what that
*  about well as there is is something that could be more or less easily grasped and the it's the
*  aboutness which for me is a common kind of short circuiting of the of the art experience. So I
*  say I'm what I'm what I'm opposed to is or find myself in opposition to is literal mindedness.
*  What I mean is just that let's not be so literal let's not take it so everything so literally. Is
*  there to be no metaphor? Is there to be no invention? It's what I meant that statement
*  nomic that it might sound is essentially let's have more fun and let's use more imagination.
*  Here's another quotation from you quote, well a good work of art does about 15
*  things simultaneously when it hangs on the wall. I think people might underestimate the
*  the decorative function of painting. Painting has various functions. A good painting satisfies
*  most of them are all of them pretty much at a high level. One of the functions historically is to
*  make the room look better to make people's emotional temperature quicken slightly when
*  when the paintings in the room as opposed to what it's not in the room. That's a decorative
*  function but it's an important one. I remember the first time I met Jasper Johns he actually
*  said to a friend of mine he was standing with us that the first obligation of a painting is
*  to make the wall look better than it's hanging on. It is one of those statements that is so
*  simple-minded books mystification but it's just a simple fact. What else does painting do? Obviously
*  we wanted to do more than just be decorative. I think any good painting, I mean really good
*  painting, expresses something true about the time in which it was made and about the maker. But
*  that's another level and doesn't have to be apparent in the same way that its decorative
*  value is apparent. What else does it do? It locates the maker in a certain history, a certain
*  dialogue, a certain discourse. It sometimes takes sides. It sometimes provokes arguments. So these
*  are other things the paintings can do. Maybe 15 is a slight exaggeration. Here's another quote,
*  it's easier to write about money than to write about art and I write about money. Well I don't
*  mean to imply that writing about money is simple. But it's easier than your job. I'm sure it's quite
*  difficult to do it well. There's an obvious problem in writing about art. Art is visual,
*  language is language. When we write about literature or sociology or something other
*  than music, the medium with which we used to describe it is somehow aligned with the experience
*  of it in the first place. And with a painting or a sculpture, when I say painting I mean visual
*  arts generally. There is always an approximation or translation that is challenging. To do it well
*  is challenging. So what is wrong? What has gone wrong with art criticism today and what is your
*  structural model for how and why that happened? Now there's so many parts of the answer which
*  I'm not sure where to begin. Part of what happened in art writing and part of what happened in
*  visual arts in America anyway, but also I think probably all over the West and maybe even all
*  over the world, is the expansion of the audience. At a certain point artists decided, not that
*  anyone got together and voted, but collectively as a result of living through a certain time,
*  artists thought wouldn't it be nice not to be put in the art ghetto any longer, be kept in the
*  art ghetto any longer, but to be entering into the broader culture, having more of a dialogue with
*  other the other arts, other more popular arts, more even entertainment. We don't want to be kept
*  below 10th Street anymore and they got their wish. I don't think anyone quite realized that
*  achieving that was going to come at a cost and the cost was a dumbing down, a simplification,
*  whether it's over or not, I don't know, it's a matter of debate. The audience greatly expanded,
*  the kind of awareness of the visual arts and the general public expanded enormously, and with that,
*  there was also a need for interlocutors and interpreters, people who could explain the art
*  to the audience. So it was a growth industry for a while, not so much anymore. A lot of people were
*  tried their hand at what in the past might have been very, very select group of people who had
*  some intimate connection with the people they were writing about. Increasingly, art writing just
*  resembled journalism. They say it's reporting on this person having a show here and this person's
*  themes are X and this person comes from this culture, there's a catalogue of either identity
*  markers or subject matter markers or in other words, which club that artist belongs to, clubs.
*  It's all fine, good and probably necessary, but it's not criticism and it's not thoughtful and then
*  maybe it has a deleterious effect on the art experience itself if we can use that term,
*  to say it like that. So if I want to learn how to read better, to learn about art and read about
*  art and if there's something wrong with art criticism today, what is it that I best should
*  do? Your own book aside. When I wrote my book, I took a page from another artist critic named
*  Fairfield Porter. Fairfield Porter was a painter who lived in Southampton, made very high-level
*  paintings in a realist, a French realist tradition, landscapes to life, what not. Was also a very
*  serious critic, a serious reviewer and critic and Fairfield wrote one of his essays that,
*  and I'm paraphrasing, that one's immediate reaction to work of art are not dissimilar to the way one
*  reacts to meeting a new person. That is to say, when you meet somebody, when you know within a
*  millisecond whether that person is likely for you or not, your course can be wrong and you can change
*  your opinion, but we form first opinions, first impressions, we meet people and that's part of
*  life, part of the discourse of life. So what Fairfield was doing, was making, was an analogy
*  between that experience which we all have every day or most days and the visual art experience
*  where we know what we feel about something usually, but we don't, but unlike meeting people when we
*  meet art, we don't trust that feeling. So we have to then go to the wall label and the wall label
*  tells us X and then we get confused because the wall label doesn't really describe what we think
*  or feel about it. Maybe we think or feel nothing in particular, maybe we think or feel boredom,
*  but we're told it's the painting is, that work of art is about X and if we're good students,
*  we kind of commit that to memory and repeat that and it pretty soon becomes the thing that
*  everybody says about that painting. It just simply may not be, may not align with anyone's
*  experience. So this very simple piece of advice, if that's even the right word, simple procedure,
*  is for people to simply ask themselves, what is it that you really find yourself thinking about
*  when you're looking at something? And the answer to that might in fact be boredom or nothing or
*  something unpleasant and that's fine and there are plenty of other things to look at, just move on.
*  I think without the ability to tell the truth about it, what the experience feels like, then
*  we're stuck, then we have to manufacture all these other criteria, which may or may not be true. I
*  mean they might be true, they might in fact impact things in a meaningful way, but there's
*  always the danger that those criteria are taking on a life of their own and they become a substitute
*  for the experience rather than the actual experience. Now that being said, the experience
*  can and probably will change, but as long as one is alert to what that change is, that to me seems
*  healthy and part of the process. I don't know if that makes any sense? Yes, but just to be very concrete, let's say someone
*  asks you, I want to take one actionable step tomorrow to learn more about art and they're a smart,
*  highly educated person, but have not spent much time in the art world. What should they actually
*  do other than look at art on the reading level? On the reading level? Oh God, Tyler, that's hard. I have to think
*  about it, I have to come back with an answer in a few minutes. I'm not sure there's anything
*  concretely to do on the reading level. There probably is, it's just not coming to mind. There's Henry
*  Geldzahler, wrote a book very late in his life, at the end of his life. I can't remember the title, but he addresses the
*  problem of how something which is almost a taboo, how do you acquire taste? Right. Which is in a sense
*  what we're talking about. Yeah. It's something one can't even speak about it in public society, among
*  art historians or our critics. Taste is considered to be something not worth discussing. It's simply,
*  we're all above that. Taste is in a sense something that has to do with Hallmark greeting cards,
*  but it's not true. Taste is what we have to work with. It's a way of describing a human
*  experience. Henry was the first curator of modern and contemporary art at the Metropolitan Museum
*  in New York. He was a wonderful guy and a wonderful raconteur. Henry basically answers your question
*  in the following ways. Start collecting. Okay, I don't have any money. How can I collect art? We don't have to
*  collect great paintings. We just go to the flea market and buy a vase for five bucks. Bring it back
*  to your room, live with it, and look at it. Pretty soon, you'll start to make distinctions about it,
*  and eventually, if you're really paying attention to your own reactions, you'll use it up and you'll
*  go and you'll give it that to somebody else and you go back to the flea market and you buy another vase,
*  slightly better vase, and you bring that home and live with that. And so the process goes. And that's
*  very real. It's very concrete. What is wrong with the incentives of museum curators? The incentives.
*  So there's a structural problem there, which you can identify for us as you see fit. And where does
*  that problem come from? It's really interesting to even think about curators' work as being
*  incentivized in the first place. I think that's a brilliant formulation. But they might be too
*  risk-averse, too conformist. There's a lot of stories you could tell. Well, in this country,
*  the curator's answer to the director and the director answers to the board of directors. So
*  there's a lot of oversight and there's a lot of people who have to be not pleased or mollified.
*  They're not so controlling. But however, nobody wants to make an unpopular show or make a show
*  which is controversial in the wrong way. Controversial in the right way might have been good a while ago,
*  but now any controversy so quickly shifts over into being the unwelcome kind that definitely
*  has made people more risk-averse. Beyond the obvious aversion to that kind of risk,
*  there are as many different kinds of curators as there are different kinds of artists, obviously,
*  and they have different intentions, different sensibilities. But there's this problem,
*  which we first started talking about in terms of how criticism has changed. It all stems from the
*  trying to redefine the nature of the public art experience. What is the experience the public
*  is meant to have with art and what is it that we're trying to encourage them to have? So the
*  curator is in a way caught in the middle of this dilemma that they're hired because they're experts
*  in something they've all done very diligent research and work and publishing in various
*  areas in which they're expert. They want to share their expertise with the art-viewing public.
*  That expertise may not be in a particularly popular area. What are they meant to do? The
*  shows in big museums, like the Museum of Modern Art, for example, are usually planned five years
*  ahead at least, if not longer. The amount of logistical effort and the amount of money required
*  to produce a major show at a major museum is daunting. So no one wants to make a mistake.
*  That's not always a healthy situation to be in. It is a profession, and again, I'm not in it,
*  so I'm talking about it looking at it from the outside. I could be wrong. It's not a profession
*  that has encouraged or rewarded mavericks very much. There have been some. Walter Hobbs was one
*  example. I was fortunate enough to have been friends with him and worked with him a number
*  of times. Walter had his fearless view of what constituted 20th century art. He was very
*  comfortable communicating to people, but there have been few. The way that curators are educated
*  in the graduate schools and the way they're promoted in the museums doesn't exactly encourage
*  that kind of risk-taking. I'm not sure it would be rewarded in the art press if they did, but again,
*  it's hypothetical. Philosopher David Hume had suggested that the closest we could come to a
*  final standard of aesthetic quality was some notion of the test of time, what survives and
*  is appreciated by future generations. Do you agree? And if not, why not? It reminds me of the
*  Wittgenstein dictum, not that we're playing competing philosophers here, but the Wittgenstein
*  dictum for the meaning of something, consider its use. I think things can have things, meaning art
*  objects, art things, can have short-term use, they can have long-term use, they can have use that
*  comes and goes, comes in and out of focus, they can be put to different uses in different times.
*  All of that seems natural and fine to me, and I'm not sure that there's one long-term test which
*  all great works of art would pass, or that's something that's so durable that it doesn't
*  change. There's, and again, test of time according to whom, you know, who's judging, who's the judge.
*  But say Angelika Kaufman, who was much heralded in her lifetime in the 18th century, is now
*  considered a good painter, but somewhat of a curiosity, important for her role in getting
*  women into the arts, but not a great painter anymore. That would be one example. I mean,
*  should our default be to trust? No, I don't think so. I think one should make one's own judgment,
*  and it might differ greatly from accepted opinion. If you look, say, at the abstract
*  expressionists and their reputations and what they did, what would be an example where you think the
*  test of time is wrong? So you have Pollock, you have Klein, you have Motherwell, right? They all
*  have reputations. Where has the test of time messed up there? I mean, which one's overrated or which
*  one's underrated? In your view, yeah. I'm one of those people who has so deeply bought into the
*  whole mythology of the abstract expressionist generation that I don't find them overrated. I
*  find them fundamental and central. I find them foundational in the 20th and 21st century painting,
*  that they're irreplaceable. And they are so for very specific reasons having to do with an
*  unrepeatable historical set of events that produced in these particular people some response that was
*  unprecedented and long-lasting and for me still reverberating, probably not so for other people,
*  younger people, although who knows. Collectively, there are times when artists collectively move
*  forward in a way where it stays moved. Now there are people who came, let's say people came right
*  after that particular group, what's called the second generation abstract expressionist. I mean,
*  perhaps they didn't move the needle any further. Maybe the needle couldn't go any further in that
*  direct in that particular direction. And those people, we now feel many of them were overrated
*  in their time or have simply faded into another kind of level. But the people who really fuse
*  baseline materials and make out of that fusion something which is both personal, unique to that
*  person and also addresses the broader aesthetic situation and also once that further opens the
*  door for other people, those people are rare. And when it happens, I don't think it's an accident
*  that they rise and I don't think it's something which goes away. Now it might, as I said earlier,
*  it might simply be of less use to this generation than to that generation. But if you bother to
*  look at what it actually is or how it was constituted, I think it can come to life again.
*  As you know, the 17th century in European painting is a quite special time. You have
*  Velázquez, you have Ruben, you have Freigel, much, much more. And there's so many talented
*  painters today. Why can they not paint in that style anymore? Or can they? What stops them?
*  Artists are trained in such a vastly different way than in the 17th, 18th, or even the 19th century.
*  We just don't have the training. We're not trained in an apprentice guild situation where
*  the apprenticeship starts very, very early in life and the people who exhibit talent in drawing or
*  painting are moved on to the next level. Today painters are trained in professional art schools.
*  People reach school at the normal age, 18, 20, 22, something in grad school, and then they're in a
*  big hurry. So if it's something you can't master or show proficiency in quickly, let's just drop it
*  and move on. There are other reasons as well, cultural reasons, for many years, for decades,
*  painting in, let's say, the style of Velázquez or even Salomoné, what would have been the reason
*  for it? What would have been the motivation for it? Let's even assume that one could do it.
*  Modernism, from whenever we date it, from 1900 to 1990, was such a persuasive argument. It was
*  such an inclusive and exciting and dynamic argument that what possibly could have been the reason to
*  want to take a step back 200 years in history and paint like an earlier painter. But if you think
*  modernism is now exhausted, which is a plausible view at least, and you need to go somewhere and
*  you can't get any more abstract, but still people don't go back very much. No, I mean I totally agree
*  with your formulation, but people are going back. It's just not so easy. The first time I saw John
*  Curran's work, for example, there was a show that moment did, I think it was with Laura Hoppin,
*  did the show of John and who else, maybe Elizabeth Payton, maybe even Lacey Uscavitch, I can't remember,
*  there might have been three of them, Triple Whammy, and first thing I thought when I saw John's
*  painting was, oh, this guy owes nothing to modernism. He just doesn't care. It was my first awakening
*  that there is a generation for whom it was really no big deal. John had started out his career making
*  abstract paintings, very credible, very likable abstract paintings, but he clearly realized that
*  he was the tail end of something and the beginning of something. John was one of the few artists who
*  had the talent and skills, who took the time to acquire the skills to paint in a way which would
*  have been out of the reach for many other people. We're just at the beginning of that next phase.
*  There might be people painting like Velázquez the next decade. It's unlikely because the truth of it
*  is there were very few people in the 17th century who painted like Velázquez. There really is only
*  one Velázquez. There's really only one Manet. There's only really only one whoever you think
*  is really great. There's only really one Pontormo. It's not that everybody in the 17th century,
*  or the 16th century, was painting in a certain way. There were always these exemplars, and what
*  allowed them to reach this other heights at a level is very mysterious and powerful in the
*  conversation. But this, for a better word, the academic style of painting is something which is
*  hard to do alone. It's part of a whole culture, a whole academy of looking, a whole way of looking
*  and setting up the studio and having a certain kind of assistance, a certain kind of pigments,
*  a certain kind of tests of drawing and things that contributed to the look and feel of those paintings.
*  I mean, one could do it. It would just take a tremendous effort of will, and then what exactly would be the point.
*  But I agree. We think that, I think here's the point. We think that art is like a menu in a Chinese
*  restaurant for the artist. The artist surveys the history of art and says, I'll have one of those,
*  and one of those, and one of those. I want to paint like Rembrandt in the morning and like Titian
*  in the afternoon, and then I want to paint like George O'Keeffe before I go to bed. And it just isn't,
*  that's not the reality. The reality is you kind of stuck with what your own body can do, your own
*  aptitude, your own level of coordination and control. It's more like athletics. It's more like you can't.
*  But athletes just seem to get better with time. I tend to think there's something about urgency. So
*  to be Cezanne or Velazquez, there was something you had to feel was extremely urgent, and it's
*  simply impossible today to feel those same things as being urgent, because they're either taken
*  care of or they're irrelevant or they're not part of your society or politics, and other things feel urgent.
*  Yeah, no, I think that's true. It is a matter of urgency. It's also a matter of what, but if you try
*  to imagine being Cezanne, what was painting like immediately preceding Cezanne, if you look at
*  Cezanne's early work, which basically answered the question, we don't know exactly what allowed
*  Cezanne to break out of the dark, dour, brown, heavily outlined, agitated, congested paintings
*  of his youth into the Cezanne that we all know, but it didn't happen overnight. It was a long,
*  slow, and probably torturous process and something for which it was not immediately rewarded. So it
*  is always the individual plus the cultural and the technological, you could say, the technology
*  of painting in his lifetime was X, and he added Y to the X, and part of that is unknowable, because
*  the secret resides with him. It's interesting to think about what is it about the culture today
*  that's producing the art today. I think that's the question. Is it? That's what you're asking?
*  Yes. So the rise of photography would be one of many examples.
*  Right. I think that's my answer was going to be, we're in a kind of documentary mode, and I'm sure
*  the rise of photography, or not just the rise, let's say the deluge of photography.
*  And the centrality of it.
*  The centrality of it has contributed to that. I mean, for sure, I mean, this is in a way the most
*  obvious thing of all. The artists we mentioned in the past were able to do what they did because
*  we didn't have cameras. So they were required to document things in a way which is no longer
*  required of artists, painters. But in general, we're in a mode, a mood, a cultural moment that
*  favors the documentary as a meaningful expression of our time. That would certainly not have been
*  the case in 1950, 1940, 1960. Now if I think of some painters, when I see their works altogether
*  in the form of a major retrospective, I enjoy them more and they make more sense to me. So
*  Roy Lichtenstein or Jasper Jones would be examples. There are other great painters, Cy Twombly,
*  I saw a big retrospective of his work. I didn't like it less. But when I walked out of it,
*  I didn't feel especially enriched. You may disagree on who belongs to what category. But
*  what differentiates the artists who do much better when you see a retrospective of all their work
*  together? What's the extra thing you're learning or gaining? It's a very good question. You can
*  almost divide artists into two categories, the ones who constantly evolve, constantly change,
*  take on new challenges, even take on new, almost like new identities, versus the ones who don't.
*  And I don't think the ones who don't are lesser necessarily, or that they're less good when they're
*  profound, less deeply pleasurable when you engage with their work. But they're definitely less
*  rewarding as retrospective material, because the work is more all of a piece. I mean, everyone's
*  work is all of a piece, but all of a piece just in terms of its surface attributes. So yes,
*  having found his process, his way of picture making, varied in that process less, say,
*  than Jasper, certainly less than Roy. Even Roy clung to the black outline throughout his entire
*  career, and up until the very end, if he had lived longer, we would have seen works where the outline
*  itself was jettisoned, but that was the unifying principle of all of his work. I mean, Jasper is a
*  really fascinating example, but I think quite rare in that early Jasper was very different from work
*  of the 70s, which is very different from work of the 80s and 90s, etc. And yet, there's some
*  mistakeable, we see a painting by him from whatever date, some mistakeably his, but his concerns
*  changed, his technique changed, his scale changed, certainly his subject matter changed, his very
*  idea of having subject matter changed. So there's just quite a lot of movement, and if it's coherent
*  and consistent and graspable as the expression of one personality, however diverse within that
*  personality, it's a very exhilarating experience to have. But it's also the question of the curator.
*  A curator has to make the roadmap, which one can follow. Now we're sitting here in your studio,
*  surrounded by your paintings, your relatively prolific painter always working. What are the
*  biggest just purely physical problems you encounter being a painter? I like to paint at a certain
*  scale. These pictures that we're looking at now, they're tall, some of them are 10 feet tall, 10
*  feet square. Making a painting that size just requires a certain kind of physical energy,
*  kind of reach and stamina. It's very different from making a 30-inch high portrait. It becomes
*  naturally to me that kind of physical engagement with the canvas at a certain scale. It's something
*  that I've always done, I've always had that sense of scale in my work. Other artists might have a
*  completely different sense of scale. But regardless, painting is a physical activity and it requires
*  concentration, obviously mental concentration, but also just physical stamina. It is, I think I've said
*  this other places, it is one of the things in life that you can get better at with age instead of
*  worse. But you do reach a point where the physical body is a limitation. Just how many hours a day
*  you can work, how big you can work. When you walk through a museum as an artist, how is it you do
*  that differently? Even differently from someone who's not an artist. Right, but someone who has some
*  background in looking at the visual arts. Right. In my experience, artists are both more patient and
*  more impatient than the non-artist in a museum setting. I am so impatient. I do not want to linger
*  in front of things that don't interest me. I don't care who made them, I don't care what time period
*  they were made in, I don't care the incredible backstory of how that thing ended up in the museum,
*  just couldn't interest me less. I just want the visual hit of that adrenaline rush of some visual
*  piece of interior feeling, knowledge, insight, and without it I'm gone. When I find it, I can stay in
*  front of a painting for hours, long after people of sensibility would have moved on. What do you
*  think is the biggest thing wrong with leading American museums today? I remember a conversation
*  with a Whitney trustee a long time ago, maybe 30 years ago. I can't remember what show we were
*  talking about, talking about this slate, the head schedule. And this guy said, oh no, you have to
*  understand what we want is bodies through turnstiles. So okay, that's what we want. We need,
*  museums need a great deal of money to operate. Where does it come from? It doesn't come from
*  the government. It comes from ticket sales and private individuals and corporations. It's not
*  the good nor bad, just a fact of life. How to make it better. We were talking last night,
*  there are so many regional museums that serve specific populations that, and I agree with you,
*  I think do such a great job of giving access to visual experience of various eras and various
*  types to people. If anyone just wanders in, it's going to get something out of it. I'm a great
*  fan and believer of museum culture and museums in whatever city I'm in, forming the backbone of my
*  travel experience. I'm sorry, what was the question? What's wrong with American museums?
*  What's wrong with them? Looking at them as an economist, I see they put out maybe five or ten
*  percent of their collections or sometimes even less. And that at least on the surface appears
*  inefficient. I understand why they hoard in endowment. It's a signal to donors that they'll
*  be reliable, that they won't sell the painting to somewhere where it has a lesser value. But it
*  still seems to me that's wrong. It has to be wrong to lock up so much wonderful, interesting output,
*  more or less forever. Yeah. Right? I mean the thing that all museums have gotten caught up in,
*  and European museums as well in the last 50 years, is the building boom, the architecture.
*  Bonanza has been great for architects, where a museum has to claim architectural singularity
*  to get press, to get attendance, to get donors. So much of the attention and the money has gone
*  into the making of the buildings. Some of them good, some of them not so good, many of them not
*  so good. But many of them, I think to a fairly surprising degree, are not necessarily hospitable
*  places to look at art. There might be incredible examples of urban intervention or the building
*  arts, but they're not necessarily places that are particularly congenial looking at,
*  certainly looking at paintings, maybe looking at other kinds of art, other forms of art,
*  that could well be suited for that. I sometimes wish that less attention, certainly less money,
*  went into the creation of vast buildings and more to just, as you say, just showing off the
*  collection. We've all had, you've been to those great museums in Europe which are essentially
*  repurposed industrial buildings, with very little in the way of amenities. They just have great
*  stuff you look at. I'd like to see more of that. When you make a bad painting, what is your best
*  account of what it is that has gone wrong in you? That's a great question. It's not like my hand
*  slipped, right? I fell off the ladder. It may happen sometimes. Yeah, that happens too. There are so
*  many ways a painting can fail, most of them disheartening. Probably the most disheartening
*  is when the whole pictorial conception was wrong. I visualized this thing that was going to be so
*  great. It's not that I didn't execute it properly. I executed it properly and looked at it and realized
*  the concept was stupid or was insincere or was involved in some way with something which wasn't
*  true and was a lapse in taste or was juvenile or something. That's not fun. The other thing that's
*  not fun is, but maybe more honorable or less full of self-reproach, at least the way I work,
*  sometimes the pictures to reach a height depend on a gamble. I'm placing a bet, a wager, that I put
*  this thing next to that thing, magic's gonna happen. It's gonna catch fire and I just know it. I just
*  know it. Sometimes it doesn't work, but at least I tried. I tried something that didn't work,
*  didn't pay off. Get rid of it. Those are two common paths to failure. Then there are other
*  paths to failure which are truly embarrassing, which is I just wasn't paying enough attention.
*  I thought that was the right blue, but it wasn't the right blue. Anyone paying attention would have
*  known it wasn't the right blue. That sounds so mundane, but that's probably more often the case.
*  If you could for us, please trace through the history of two of your paintings that could be
*  imaginary, so to speak, ideal types. One is a very good painting that did very well and helped your
*  reputation a lot. The other is a so-so or below average David-Sally painting. Just trace who buys
*  them or where they end up. Give us the two hypothetical paths and how they differ. They're
*  really good painting. How does that go? How they differ in terms of their journey in the world?
*  Agnes Gunn buys it, David Geffen buys it, and 16 years later it's donated to MoMA. That would be a
*  happy story, right? Tell us the happy story. You don't have to name names. Then tell us the less
*  happy story. It's hard to do without naming names. But a prominent collector of high renown would be fine.
*  There are so many delusions, self-delusions, that are involved in being an artist, the life of an
*  artist, I think probably most of which are necessary. Especially when you're a young artist,
*  you have no right to think these things, or feel these things, or presume any of these things.
*  But sometimes you are encouraged by the people around you, dealers or collectors or other artists,
*  that these delusions maybe are legitimate. I remember making a painting in the very early 80s. I just
*  thought it was a winner. My dealer at the time was basically just told, or whatever she thought
*  they wanted to hear. So this is a painting which we're reserving for a museum. This is now in
*  the artist parlance, it's museum only. She even made a list of which museums would be likely.
*  Well, no museum was interested in this painting. No major collector was interested in this painting.
*  I can't remember what happened to the painting. The painting went to some collector, then it went
*  to auction, then it went to some other collector, it went to another auction. I don't even know
*  where it is today. I'd be happy not to know where it is. But this is a painting that, at the time,
*  I thought this is museum only. The artist might be the last to know. There have been a few happy
*  stories. The happy stories are usually a result of a personal relationship with a collector,
*  or with a curator. Someone who has followed what you've been trying to do, and has been
*  sympathetic to what you've been trying to do, and therefore is more attuned, their antenna is more
*  attuned to when something is an opportunity. There was one painting, actually a painting that you were
*  looking at in the book earlier this morning, that was purchased by a very, very good collector on
*  the West Coast, and was a very good friend of mine, and someone who's very generous with other
*  museums and with other artists. The collector opened his collection to a curator from MoMA,
*  basically saying, take whatever you want. So we felt sure that the curator was going to take this
*  painting, which we had all kind of agreed at the time, had reached this sort of level. But guess
*  what? The curator didn't take that painting. He took a much lesser painting. We were baffled, but
*  he went with the curator's choice. Then the painting, let's say the A painting, used this horrible
*  expression, kicked around for a while. It was in some other collection. It was shown in London a
*  few times. And then finally ended up in a very good collection in New York. So this is the vagaries of
*  commerce and taste that the paintings are subjected to, and are somehow intimately tied up with.
*  If you think of the really great collectors, Herbert and Dorothy Fogel, the Meyerhoffs,
*  Eli Broad, opinions may differ, but what is it to you that they have in common as a class?
*  I'm not sure, Tal, I can think of what they have in common. They seem to me, and I would probably,
*  add a bunch of other names, it's hard to generalize about them, honestly. They seem so different,
*  one from another. I guess you could say their motivations are similar. For some reason,
*  this work speaks to them, and they have arranged their lives in such a way as to be, to a certain
*  extent, defined themselves, defined by this body of work that they've created, they've collected,
*  created the work, they've created the context for the work. It's a kind of transference,
*  the kind of, kind of, prodo, prodo-sorial arrangement. I mean, it's not, it's no accident,
*  I think that some of the most active collectors have been producers, movie producers, theatrical
*  producers. There's a will toward making meaning, there's a will toward wanting to say something
*  about one's time and place. That's all very, very interesting and very laudable. Sometimes,
*  it's just greed, they just love these things, they don't want to part with them, they don't
*  want anyone else to have them, they want to, you know, they just want them. That's also doesn't,
*  that seems fine with me. But most of the really great ones, I mean, the active ones, sooner or
*  later, maybe just have practical considerations, have wanted to share that collection with the
*  public, which is certainly, that's the kind of American system that we've evolved.
*  And how are artists different as collectors? You have a collection of your own, right?
*  I do find artists collect from, more from informational, an informational standpoint.
*  The artist has, owes nothing to the art world vis-a-vis their collection. The artist isn't
*  making a statement about the world in their collection, or is the artist judged by their
*  collection? The collection is a really private matter. It's more like a library. So, I mean,
*  for example, my friend Jeff Koons collects Courbet paintings, which I would too, if I could afford
*  them. I think that's great. He doesn't collect art like his own. He collects art very, very
*  different from his own. I collect things that are very different from what I make. And I don't
*  actually live with my work in the house. The way in which an artist uses another artist's work is
*  sometimes very eccentric and hard to trace, or hard to see at first. I think artist's collections
*  have more to do with wanting to be reminded of something, wanting to be nudged by something,
*  wanting to have something as a touchstone. Sometimes it has a spiritual component, a
*  Buddhist scholar rock or something of the sort. Sometimes it's something relatively insignificant,
*  but it's a reminder or a link to a whole other world and another experience.
*  Why is it that Frank O'Hara has been so important to both you and Alex Katz? And Alex Painter
*  Frank, as you probably know, right? Frank was important to Alex for a number of reasons. One of
*  the most important reasons is that Alex is a great consumer of and connoisseur of poetry generally
*  in New York School of Poetry in particular, and they were contemporaries and friends. So it's
*  inconceivable that Alex wouldn't have been interested in or close to Frank O'Hara. Unfortunately,
*  I didn't get to meet Frank O'Hara, but I discovered his poetry when I was a kid. It spoke to me,
*  for whatever reason. It's actually very easy, as poetry goes, to grasp. And he continues to
*  epitomize something about that time and place, the late 40s to the mid 60s, late 60s, which still
*  remains a touchstone and also still full of mystery and full of sensibility. Let's say it's
*  the roots, it's where one finds the roots of a certain sensibility, which for me is still very
*  much alive, maybe not for anybody else. He is the certain kind of painter's poet par excellence. He
*  is the poet of nouns, the poet of things, the poet of appearances, and the poet of connections
*  between things. I mean, in a way, he's the perfect poet. It's a list of names, but it's more than a
*  list of names. It's what happened at the party, but it's also about mortality. It's about beauty,
*  it's also about degradation. It's very accessible and very musical. I don't think it's an accident.
*  Many painters are. Which is your favorite Preston Sturgis movie and why? They're all so great. I think
*  the one I've seen the most doesn't mean I think it's necessarily the greatest, but what I've seen
*  the most is the Lady Eve. I've seen it at least 20 times. I still laugh, it still cracks me up.
*  I kind of think of Sturgis, all five of the great films, as one film. It's one super long
*  film which just keeps playing in my head. The Hail the Conquering Hero is certainly the most
*  complex and in a way almost painful, psychologically painful. At the time it was made, it was quite
*  radical, though most viewers may not have seen that. It's a great film, it's a great achievement,
*  the crowd scenes, the image of the town. I love Sturgis' depiction of a town, the life of a town.
*  His other films are centered on much smaller social groups. It was his Frank Capra film.
*  Maybe Sullivan's Travels is the most delicious. That's my favorite. The complex narrative of
*  what art should be for, which can be read in a number of different directions. There's an
*  obscure early one called The Sin of Harold Dittlebach. You know that one? No, I don't.
*  With Harold Lloyd. It's a weird film. It's a guy who works in a bank, who's never had a drink in
*  his life. He finally gets laid off at the bank, takes the money, his severance pay, goes to a bar
*  for the first time in his life. And then we see him the next morning having purchased a circus,
*  which he brings home. He's living with his sister anyway. Crazy Preston Sturgis plot.
*  No, Sturgis is fabulous. I think about a lot. Why do you find the TV show The Sopranos so interesting?
*  Very much like the way I think about painting, when I think about art in general, what The Sopranos
*  shows is someone who took the conventions of the day, gangsters, mafia, cops, and made out of it
*  something which hadn't existed, just psychological realism that had a texture, a most granular
*  texture of life as it's lived so that people who have no, I mean most of us have no encounters
*  with the mafia really. We all imagined that we were part of the mafia and we all imagined that
*  we all projected ourselves into these families and social groups in which this mafia behavior
*  was completely normalized. The fact that David Chase made out of this convention something so
*  psychologically dense, so much about the family, the damage that families do to one another,
*  the constraints of society versus the individual, the stifling of imagination that he managed to
*  make out of this crime drama metaphors for almost every dilemma in American society from
*  the inability of the individual to be different, to be survive, I mean all these issues which now
*  think of as commonplace, that he could locate them inside of a weekly drama about crime family,
*  still seems to me to be miraculous and also a model for what art can do or how it should
*  think of itself, that it's the engagement with certain givens and then who the hell knows where
*  it's going to go after that. How should we change intellectual property law for artists?
*  I am somewhat vague myself on what it even says now. There have been some cases, I'm not sure how
*  they were settled or to what extent their landmarks but I do feel in terms of visual culture,
*  I mean I've spent a good part of my career appropriating things that other people did,
*  you could say it's just wrong, it's deft and that would be you know certainly a position that would
*  be hard to argue with. My position is very different, that everything that exists exists
*  in the present tense and that everything can be material for someone else without violating its
*  original status and that one thing doesn't impinge on the other and that it doesn't need
*  to be protected because if it's any good it protects itself. That's my view, I don't know
*  what the law says. In my view it's too hard to appropriate images whether in painting or in rap
*  music or the difference between who can have the rights to a painting, the rights to the photograph,
*  just seems too complicated. I think there should be more open access. To close I'd like to offer
*  three different statements from you as we started and you can tell us what you meant by each one.
*  Here's one and I quote, one of the principal cultural alliances is between the avant-garde
*  and sexual libertinism. I wish it were true. It seems as though the avant-garde is no more
*  protected from puritanism, puritanicalism than in the other segment of society. So I think I was
*  wrong on that one. I think it was wishful thinking. Here's another one from you, quote,
*  it may surprise you but my work is full of love. Well the second part is true. The surprise part
*  is, it depends on who you ask and what day. I wonder, and I don't know if it would be possible
*  to make a survey or who would give you an honest answer, but I wonder if every artist,
*  or rather how many artists, feel that the use to which their work has been put in public and the
*  fact that it's been put to any use at all is already a huge privilege and something that
*  I'm grateful for and I think everyone is grateful for. However, if the gap between the way one's
*  work has been perceived and the way one perceives it oneself, how big is that gap and why is it so
*  big? Is it is the fact that there's a gap, is it a failure on the part of the artist? Quite possibly.
*  That's certainly one way to read it. Is it simply a matter of more time? Is it necessary? I like to
*  think that's the answer, if I could be wrong. Over time the acid in the paintings gets dialed down or
*  actually just leaks out and what's left is, I don't know if it's opposite is exactly right,
*  but something very different. Let's put it this way, Tyler. Making a painting, as you just said,
*  even appropriating something is a lot of work. Making a painting is a lot of work. Making a
*  painting that hangs together, holds together, the elements hold together, the colors are in the right
*  intervals and the formal elements work and the sub-segment elements work, it's a hell of a lot
*  of work. To go to all that trouble just to be a smartass, it's kind of not worth it. You have to
*  have a little bit bigger game in mind. Anyone makes a painting on any level,
*  is trying to communicate something fairly complex and fairly involved with, for a better word,
*  human emotions. Again, the language that returns us to our original question, the language that we
*  use to talk about these things, that these things are cool, these things are hot. I'm just not sure
*  any of that stuff means anything. The last question is a hypothetical one you posed to your former
*  teacher, John Baldessari, and I quote, which is better for an artist, to be loved or feared? Yeah,
*  well I think to be loved is much better, but I've known artists who would choose the other option.
*  David Salley, thank you very much. Thank you, Tyler.
