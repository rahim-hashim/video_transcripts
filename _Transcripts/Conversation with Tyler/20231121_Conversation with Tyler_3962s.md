Video Description: Is Matt Levine a modern-day Horace? Like Matt, Horace has a preoccupation with wealth and the law. There’s a playful humor as he segues from topic to topic. An ability to read Latin. And many of Horace’s letters are about the length of a Bloomberg View column. QED, says Tyler.

So Matt, the Latin teacher turned lawyer turned investment banker turned finance writer, recently joined Tyler for a conversation on Horace and more, including cryptocurrencies, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Nabakov, New York, Uber, financial regulation, market volatility, M&A, whether finance is nerdy, and why panic is central to the Matt Levine production function.

# Matt Levine Live at Bloomberg HQ | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ)
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=8.42s)]
*  Learn more at mercatus.org. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=12.24s)]
*  And for more conversations, including videos, transcripts, and upcoming dates, visit conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=15.34s)]
*  I thought we would start with Matt Levine's greatest hits, and then Matt, having been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=30.0s)]
*  a classics major, we'd move on to the Latin classics and maybe tie the two together a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=38.84s)]
*  bit. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=44.2s)]
*  So just to think about derivatives markets, you've worked in that sector. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=45.2s)]
*  By some measures, derivatives are over a quadrillion in value, outstanding. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=48.04s)]
*  But there's another way you can measure the net positions and turn it into zero. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=52.8s)]
*  So what's the right way to think about how large derivative markets are and what's the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=56.98s)]
*  risk associated with that size? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=61.58s)]
*  The right way to think about it, the way that you would do it if you're actually working [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=64.1s)]
*  in the derivatives market, is to think about the risk exposures of it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  So if you have an interest rate swap, the right way to think about it is the DVO one. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=77.69999999999999s)]
*  The right way to think about an equity swap is the delta of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=83.5s)]
*  Often you see these quadrillion dollar numbers, they're quadrillion dollar notional of short-term [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=88.7s)]
*  interest rate swaps, where the idea that you could lose a quadrillion dollars on it is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=94.74s)]
*  quite low. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=98.66s)]
*  The risk of that is quite low. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=99.66s)]
*  The systemic question, I don't know the answer to, how risky are derivatives in general? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  There's a time when derivatives are weapons of mass destruction, and I think obviously [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=110.54s)]
*  there's a sense in which that came true. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=114.7s)]
*  I worked in equity derivatives and total return swaps didn't blow up the world. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  A specific set of exposures to specific risks were bad and were perhaps magnified by the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  ability to make zero-sum bets on them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  But the idea that the notional of derivatives is somehow itself a risk factor was never [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=131.26s)]
*  super compelling to me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=137.10000000000002s)]
*  There's a certain centralization of risk with derivatives. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=138.74s)]
*  You put a lot of risk into a clearinghouse. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=141.82000000000002s)]
*  Maybe you can bail out the clearinghouse if you have to more efficiently than individual [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=144.06s)]
*  investors, but that also increases moral hazard. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=147.9s)]
*  At the margin, do you think we've centralized derivatives risk too much or too little? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=150.78s)]
*  I think we're still in a little bit early phases of doing it, but I think we've ... I'm [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=154.78s)]
*  among those who are a little skeptical of the notion of centralizing derivatives risk [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=160.34s)]
*  into clearinghouse. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=164.18s)]
*  It seems to me that a clearinghouse has more moral hazard than a bank. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=165.86s)]
*  Clearinghouses is often a member association where you're ultimately relying on the members [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=170.34s)]
*  for your capitalization and for your protection against blowing up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=176.0s)]
*  Whereas a bank, if you're on a desk, obviously banks have a lot of moral hazard and the notion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=180.22s)]
*  that banks have moral hazard is a lesson that has been learned and probably over-learned [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=186.70000000000002s)]
*  from the financial crisis. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  But if you're on a desk, you don't want to lose a lot of money. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  If you're a clearinghouse, your concerns about losing a lot of money are a little more attenuated, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=193.82s)]
*  I think. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=200.18s)]
*  Does your experience with derivatives make you feel better or worse about CryptoKitties [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=201.26s)]
*  being priced at 117,000 K per pop? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=205.7s)]
*  Are they just a derivative? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=210.18s)]
*  CryptoKitty ... I don't really understand ... [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=213.06s)]
*  Is a CryptoKitty a derivative on ether? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=214.66s)]
*  In the sort of ... [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=217.45999999999998s)]
*  Is there a fact of the matter? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, sure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=220.82s)]
*  In the naive sense of did it come from ether, sure. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  I think that all those markets are so immature. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=225.1s)]
*  I think of derivatives markets as being a sort of mark of maturity and of the ability [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  to understand what exposures exist in some instrument or in some economic reality and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=233.78s)]
*  then say, well, we're going to pick these exposures and hedge them out and we're going [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=241.54s)]
*  to pick these exposures and magnify them and we're going to have the ability to fine tune [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=245.22s)]
*  all of our exposures because we've been doing this for a long time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=250.42s)]
*  We've been trading currencies or equities or whatever for a long time. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  There's the beginning of a thing that you could call a derivatives market in cryptocurrency, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=257.18s)]
*  but it's not that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=261.18s)]
*  It's the opposite of that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=263.68s)]
*  No one knows what ether is in a sense. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=265.68s)]
*  The idea that you're fine tuning your exposures to it is just not ... CryptoKitties are the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=268.14s)]
*  opposite of that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=272.3s)]
*  They're making your exposures weirder and more complicated. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=273.3s)]
*  We have a good idea of how to price most futures and options, but when it comes to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=276.24s)]
*  pricing say Bitcoin or other crypto assets, what do you think is the best model we have, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=280.36s)]
*  however bad they may all be for thinking about what that value should be? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  I actually think it's ... You've said it, which is like there's some like a pool of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=289.72s)]
*  world financial wealth and then you pick a random small number and you say that percentage [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=295.6s)]
*  of world financial wealth should be Bitcoin. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=302.24s)]
*  I was persuaded by the notion that you could use a currency model and say, well, the amount [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  of transactions that you do with Bitcoin is this and the velocity is that and so this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=311.92s)]
*  is the total value of Bitcoin there should be. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  But I'm no longer persuaded by that because I don't think that Bitcoin is particularly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=317.56s)]
*  ... I don't think that people's claims for Bitcoin now are that it's a currency, that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=321.0s)]
*  it's a store of value. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=326.16s)]
*  It's a store of value that isn't tethered to anything else. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=328.56s)]
*  It's just a question of how much ... There's some percentage of people's wealth is in gold. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=330.88s)]
*  Well, if they'd shifted half of that to Bitcoin, Bitcoin would be worth X. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  That I think is the bad but best available model. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=338.48s)]
*  I think there are other cryptocurrencies you could imagine a currency model where you say, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=341.44s)]
*  well, how much file storage ... How much is the file storage market and then what would [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=346.36s)]
*  the velocity of a file coin be? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=350.92s)]
*  But I'm not sure that you could answer that because I think that the intuitions that you'd [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  have around velocity of money are not necessarily the right intuitions for velocity of a token [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  that you use to spend on files. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=364.52s)]
*  And how well Bitcoin does as a hedge or store of value relative to gold, what variables [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=366.76s)]
*  do you think of when you try to figure that out? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=372.2s)]
*  You're trying to project 10, 20 years in the future, crypto assets competing against gold [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=374.64s)]
*  or maybe even stores of fine art as held in warehouses. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  What does that depend upon? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=382.88s)]
*  Is it transactions uses? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=384.76s)]
*  Do they matter at all anymore? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  Will the dominant crypto asset be one that people also use to buy things or will those [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  two functions be totally separate? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=391.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=393.76s)]
*  I was talking to someone today who argued that if Bitcoin hadn't been invented and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=394.76s)]
*  if the white paper had been out there, but if people hadn't started using Bitcoin, what [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  would have made more sense to happen first would be the utility tokens would come first [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=404.88s)]
*  because you can explain, well, you use file coin to buy file storage or you use whatever [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=409.44s)]
*  to buy whatever. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=413.36s)]
*  Whereas with Bitcoin, you can use it to buy anything, but there's no tethered store of [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=414.36s)]
*  value to it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=419.12s)]
*  You could imagine a world where all the ICOs work and where all of the coins that you use [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=420.12s)]
*  to buy useful things work and then Bitcoin is less, because it doesn't have a sort of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=425.4s)]
*  obvious utility value, loses value. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=431.72s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=433.48s)]
*  I don't buy that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=434.48s)]
*  I think that people's desire to use 100 different currencies to do 100 different activities [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=435.48s)]
*  is probably overrated by the crypto community. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=442.08s)]
*  I think that Bitcoin's first mover advantage and popularly is fame has the potential to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=444.76s)]
*  entrench it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=453.8s)]
*  To answer your first question, I have no idea what variables you'd look at, but I think [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=454.8s)]
*  it's if Bitcoin stays above X thousand dollars for a year, then that just increases its likelihood [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=459.2s)]
*  of staying above X thousand dollars for another year. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=467.0s)]
*  Eventually, it just by force of repetition becomes a store of value. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  Since almost every store issues gift certificates, and this seems to be a profitable activity, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=474.52s)]
*  can we not imagine a future where almost every business issues cryptocurrency in some form? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=479.44s)]
*  Maybe the velocity or a volume will be low, but there'll be a cryptocurrency for every [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=484.68s)]
*  business and an ICO. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=488.56s)]
*  Just like now we have gift certificates and this is perfectly fine. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=490.24s)]
*  We shouldn't think it's weird. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=493.4s)]
*  The real question is why not more crypto kitties? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=494.96s)]
*  I've never heard of a crypto doggy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=497.6s)]
*  I've never heard of a crypto turtle, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=499.08s)]
*  Yes, no? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=501.44s)]
*  No store quintuples its market value by issuing gift certificates. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=503.76s)]
*  The crypto frenzy is not. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=510.52s)]
*  If this were a story of gift certificates, I think it would be a lot less interesting. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=513.68s)]
*  I mean, if you say, look, it's true that people don't want 100 currencies, but they use gift [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=517.52s)]
*  certificates, which is not, I don't know how much people use those gift certificates every [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  day, but if that's the story, then I suppose it's true, but that's a sad outcome for a [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=525.08s)]
*  thousand cryptocurrencies. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=533.08s)]
*  Bloom, if it's if it's just Starbucks accepts Starbucks tokens, would you rather I give [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=534.08s)]
*  you a Ponzi coin or a banana coin, a banana coin being connected to an organic bananas [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=539.76s)]
*  blockchain drawing upon banana supply in Laos? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=546.88s)]
*  Think I would take the well, I'm tempted to say like if I'm answering, I'm tempted to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=551.64s)]
*  say I take the Ponzi coin because I suspect that neither I think that they're probably [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=556.0400000000001s)]
*  equally connected to like a viable blockchain in Laos. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=560.76s)]
*  And at least the Ponzi coin like says it on the tin. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=564.24s)]
*  But I want to be careful with that, because like the the reason I take either of them is to [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=568.24s)]
*  resell them. And like clearly, the like the the the frenzy of saying that you have a [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=572.6s)]
*  utility, saying that there's a blockchain somewhere probably does increase the resale value [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=579.2s)]
*  in the extremely short term in which I'd be holding these coins. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=583.0s)]
*  We're in New York, we have Uber, we have taxis, they compete against each other. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=586.44s)]
*  There at least appears to be a long history of the taxi sector being somewhat of a natural [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  monopoly. What's the final equilibrium in New York City and elsewhere? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=595.44s)]
*  And does the company Uber have positive value given that right now it's losing money per [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=600.48s)]
*  ride? Right. Chinese investors are subsidizing us at the margin. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=604.96s)]
*  If the price goes up, I would prefer to shift back to taxis. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=609.12s)]
*  How do you think about that market? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=612.2s)]
*  As a consumer, you know, I really like Uber. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=613.84s)]
*  And I think that Uber addressed some technological failings in the just in terms of like [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=617.24s)]
*  being being able to hail Ubers without going out on the street and waiting for them and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=624.84s)]
*  being able to hail them around the world rather than, you know, like telling taxes in New [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=629.56s)]
*  York is nice, but it's nice to have an app on your phone where you can do it wherever you [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  go. So as a consumer, I'm a big fan of Uber. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think that, you know, our tax is a natural monopoly. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=640.08s)]
*  I mean, there's certainly a secret of regulatory rents in New York that, you know, it is [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=642.84s)]
*  to some extent by Uber's rhetoric about kind of breaking down. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=650.72s)]
*  There's clearly some some taxi protective regulation that is not pro consumer. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=654.76s)]
*  And to the extent Uber is fighting against that, you know, they make a good case for their [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=660.12s)]
*  flagrant disregard for the law. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, and the big question is they continue to be subsidized by investors. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=667.16s)]
*  And what is the long term outcome of that? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=672.0s)]
*  And I don't know. I think that probably I mean, presumably, like their bet is that the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  long term outcome of that is self-driving cars and that they have some sort of advantage [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=680.4s)]
*  in being the provider of the self-driving car app, which I'm not sure if that is super [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=684.52s)]
*  compelling because it seems to me it's hard to build a self-driving car. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=690.88s)]
*  It's relatively easy to build a routing app to send the self-driving car to you. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=694.52s)]
*  And so if Tesla or Apple or whoever build the best self-driving car, I'll just download [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=698.36s)]
*  Tesla's app. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=703.12s)]
*  So it's a risk for Uber. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=704.48s)]
*  But like, you know, as a strategy, bootstrapping by getting a 70 billion dollar market [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=705.92s)]
*  cap and then spending a lot of money to be the leader in self-driving cars is not a crazy [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=712.12s)]
*  strategy. Right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=715.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, they built from an app to being a 70 billion dollar company. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  So the so-called moat for the company, it starts with the app, but over time it shifts [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=719.28s)]
*  to owning a fleet of self-driving cars. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=724.12s)]
*  Maybe. Maybe. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=726.44s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't seem like a routing app is that great a moat. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you a very Matt Levine. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=732.44s)]
*  It's not bad, right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=734.04s)]
*  Because it's a network effect. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=734.64s)]
*  Sure. Like around the world, but it's not. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=735.52s)]
*  But the network of drivers, it'll work for Lyft and Uber. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=738.08s)]
*  That doesn't seem like much of a moat. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  Consumers will stick with Uber insofar as they're happy, but they're probably not [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=742.6s)]
*  intrinsically that loyal to Uber. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=746.28s)]
*  Yeah. You need someone else to get significant name recognition. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=748.32s)]
*  So like if Apple builds this self-driving car and Apple builds a driving app or a [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=751.64s)]
*  ride hailing app, then it can take on Uber pretty quickly. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=757.28s)]
*  I think if some random interloper comes, it's harder. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=760.16s)]
*  Let me ask you a very Matt Levine question. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=765.36s)]
*  Are you worried that people aren't worried enough? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=767.84s)]
*  So if we look at more Houston security prices, there are plenty of signs that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=770.88s)]
*  volatility has been quite low. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=774.84s)]
*  By some measures, it hasn't been this low for 50 years. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=776.84s)]
*  The world seems slightly unusual. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=780.28s)]
*  Not only the crypto kiddies, there are other strange features of our country and [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=782.24s)]
*  world. And is this decline in volatility? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  Is it driven by investors getting smarter by more ETFs, fewer shares out there to [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=789.92s)]
*  trade by more indexing foreign investors with nowhere else to go? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=794.76s)]
*  What's your best hypothesis? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=798.84s)]
*  There's a general background answer to that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=800.56s)]
*  I'm like such a like in my personal life, I'm such an efficient markets guy. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=801.92s)]
*  Like the answer to the question, are you worried that people aren't worried [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=805.52s)]
*  enough about anything is like I'm not because because I sort of like assume [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=808.92s)]
*  that there is like a giant pool of people who are smarter than I am. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=813.7199999999999s)]
*  And they're coming to a reasonable conclusion. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=816.8s)]
*  They're reading you, of course, thinking what does that Levine say? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=818.8s)]
*  But so like, you know, in general, if if people are like our stock price is too [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=822.16s)]
*  high as well as, you know, the VIX too, I'm like, if it was too high, it'd be [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=826.8s)]
*  lower. Right. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=830.64s)]
*  And the volatility thing, I mean, look, it's it's a thing that I find incredibly [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=833.12s)]
*  weird because I think like you, I find the world right now incredibly weird. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=837.1600000000001s)]
*  And and, you know, one wants to explain it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=841.44s)]
*  And I don't know the right explanation. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  The explanation that I sort of like is that the prices of financial assets have [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=847.32s)]
*  somewhat decoupled from human emotion about the world that is not financial [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=852.2800000000001s)]
*  assets. And, you know, why would that be? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=858.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, I would love it to be a story. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=862.2s)]
*  And I think there's probably some argument for it to be a story. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=864.6400000000001s)]
*  Of markets have become more technological. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=867.0s)]
*  We've you know, there's famously markets, stock prices overreacted to news as [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=870.08s)]
*  measured by subsequent dividend changes, you know, forever. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=875.6s)]
*  And, you know, eventually that's an anomaly that someone will exploit. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=878.4s)]
*  Right. Eventually you'll build a thing that reacts correctly to news. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=881.6s)]
*  I think that there are I don't think that's a wholly compelling thesis. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=884.64s)]
*  I think that what I like the story to be is that financial markets have gotten [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=888.4s)]
*  smarter and they have they reacted less to news. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=892.84s)]
*  And so even though the news is noisier, they react less to that noisy news [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=896.12s)]
*  because it turns out not to affect asset prices in as noisy a way as you'd think [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=900.2s)]
*  by just watching TV. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=904.88s)]
*  I think that there is something compelling to that because we actually have seen [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=906.68s)]
*  smart people build smart things that do a good job of, you know, making investing [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=911.08s)]
*  decisions. And so you'd sort of expect over time as people build more rational [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=915.12s)]
*  investing tools, investing would become more rational. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=919.36s)]
*  The good counter argument to that is that investing is not a sort of technological [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=922.1999999999999s)]
*  problem in the world that can be solved. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=927.36s)]
*  It's a interpersonal fight. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=929.4s)]
*  It's a trading in particular is a sort of attempt to be better than someone else. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  And so you can never make trading more rational because as you get better, you [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=936.64s)]
*  know, someone else gets better and like you're the residue will ultimately still [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=941.4799999999999s)]
*  be your sort of human biases. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=945.12s)]
*  But I don't know, I'm biased towards the view that that we have gotten gotten [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=946.88s)]
*  smarter at kind of decoupling our emotional reactions to the news from [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=951.76s)]
*  financial asset prices. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=957.52s)]
*  And part of that is just like. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=958.64s)]
*  Whether or not that's true globally, there's like a local sense in which, like, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=961.0s)]
*  you know, like the first day of like Trump's election, everyone panicked and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=964.08s)]
*  then he said another crazy thing and then he said another and like there's just [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=968.48s)]
*  like, eventually you tune it out. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=971.2s)]
*  And that's a form of this thing of like reacting less to financial assets, reacting [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=972.84s)]
*  less to sort of human reactions to the news. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=978.48s)]
*  There are three sets of market prices that bug me. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=982.4s)]
*  One is Bitcoin and other crypto assets. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=985.8s)]
*  Another is all the negative real yields on government securities and sometimes even [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=988.4399999999999s)]
*  negative nominal yields. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=992.76s)]
*  And then there's blue chip stocks being so high. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=994.6s)]
*  Could it be those three are part of the same general phenomenon, namely that good [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=997.16s)]
*  stores of value are relatively scarce compared to growing global wealth and that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1002.56s)]
*  money flows to each of those that has nowhere else to go. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1007.92s)]
*  They all look high. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  They're going to stay high. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1012.2399999999999s)]
*  It's a sign of our paucity of insurance markets and other ways of protecting wealth. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1013.68s)]
*  And in some ways, it's a pessimistic sign. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1018.0s)]
*  So the price can be permanently high and we should be worried about our own [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1020.0799999999999s)]
*  inability to deal with risk. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1023.7199999999999s)]
*  Yes or no. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1025.76s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1027.28s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a sort of like transmuted story of the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1027.6799999999998s)]
*  financial crisis of like the supply of low risk assets was insufficient to meet the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1031.64s)]
*  demand. And so people built things that were low risk financial assets that turned out [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1037.0800000000002s)]
*  to be risky. Right. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1041.76s)]
*  I mean, now it's a Bitcoin can replace CDOs maybe like there's a, there's a, there's a [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1042.44s)]
*  a lot of money chasing assets that are good stores of value. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1049.0400000000002s)]
*  Investors who index again, a Matt Levine question. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1052.64s)]
*  First, how worried are you about the spread of indexing? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1056.0400000000002s)]
*  But also if you think of indexing as somewhat endogenous, so if more market research is [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1059.8s)]
*  needed, you would expect fewer people to index because there's a higher return to [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  learning something. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1068.3600000000001s)]
*  So the flow of funds in and out of indexing, how rational or efficient process do you [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1069.68s)]
*  think that is at the end of the day? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1074.92s)]
*  And as we move more and more to indexing, how will this affect securities markets? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1077.16s)]
*  Please address any combination of those you care to. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  So, so the thing that I like is that, you know, U S public markets, the companies that [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1083.88s)]
*  are in there are fewer companies, they're older, they're bigger, they're more [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1089.04s)]
*  profitable. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1093.12s)]
*  And so that's, that's a sort of interesting fact about like the composition of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1094.56s)]
*  markets. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  And one sort of straightforward thing to take away from that is that in a world like [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1099.52s)]
*  that, it makes sense to index more, right. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1104.6s)]
*  In a world where you can't find the next Facebook in public markets in a world where [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1107.04s)]
*  like all companies are kind of the same, they're kind of, you know, they're established [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1111.84s)]
*  or profitable. Like the spread between companies is sort of narrower. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1115.12s)]
*  The returns to the stock picking are going to be a little lower and it's more rational [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1119.0s)]
*  to index. And then like the next question is like which side of it is causal? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1122.04s)]
*  And I think there's probably some story you could tell about the rise of indexing and [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1126.8s)]
*  the sort of focus on cost and investing generally leading to a real focus on scale and [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1131.8s)]
*  investing. And when investment funds are trying to operate at enormous scale, the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1136.56s)]
*  attractiveness of a hundred million dollar IPO is lower, the attractiveness of like a [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1144.08s)]
*  weird company that doesn't fit into the index is lower. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  And so you have the rise of indexing driving the sort of phenomenon of companies, of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  there being fewer and larger and more profitable public companies. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1156.24s)]
*  And so you have a feedback loop in that sense. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1159.8s)]
*  I feel like I've traveled away a little from your question, but. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1163.04s)]
*  Some activities are what we might call nerdy and others are not. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1165.84s)]
*  So country and Western music is not very nerdy. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1170.4399999999998s)]
*  There are plenty of bars, say in lower Manhattan, that are not very nerdy. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1173.56s)]
*  Finance has become pretty nerdy. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1178.28s)]
*  What makes an activity nerdy? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1179.6799999999998s)]
*  Has finance become pretty nerdy? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1182.1999999999998s)]
*  So I think that what makes an activity nerdy, like I think there are two like sort of, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1184.84s)]
*  you know, clusters of factors. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1189.2399999999998s)]
*  One is having some sort of academic like barrier, right? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1191.0s)]
*  Where you have to be smart to do it or you have to learn something to do it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1196.1999999999998s)]
*  Right. And the other traditionally is unpopularity. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1199.48s)]
*  Right. Like you're a nerd because you're not cool. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1205.24s)]
*  Right. I think that like the like what's happened with finance, like finance in the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1207.88s)]
*  last, you know, N years has become nerdier in the academic sense. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1214.48s)]
*  Right. Like it's just, you know, the threshold to be hired at a, you know, on a trading [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1218.96s)]
*  floor, you know, in like the days of of of liars, poker was like, you know, you needed to [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1225.84s)]
*  like, you know, be like a fun guy to hang out with and maybe I've gone to high school. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1231.36s)]
*  Right. And like, and now it's like you need a PhD in physics. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1236.4s)]
*  Right. And so until like, like in that sense, it's become nerdier. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1239.52s)]
*  But like, there's also like, I think of tech as having, you know, computer programming [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1244.0s)]
*  when I was like a kid was quite nerdy because it was academic. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1249.24s)]
*  But also people are like, why are you doing that? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1252.56s)]
*  Like, go play sports. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1254.44s)]
*  Right. Whereas now, I think computer, you know, you see enough like Mark Zuckerberg [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1255.32s)]
*  stories and it's like computer programming is like the way to become a billionaire who [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1259.32s)]
*  like controls the world's not just like, it's not just power, but like controls the world's [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1263.8s)]
*  like social relationships and finances like that weird point where like, you know, in [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1268.96s)]
*  New York, you like go out to the club, like there are a lot of finance people there. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1274.08s)]
*  Right. It's like it doesn't have like quite the nerdy, the sort of like pure nerdiness [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1278.3999999999999s)]
*  component. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1282.84s)]
*  And has finance become less unpopular just because of passage of time since the crisis? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1283.52s)]
*  Or is it in part because tech is now so unpopular with the media and some intellectuals [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1289.5600000000002s)]
*  that it's taken over that pride of place and finances pushed to the side and we can be [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1295.0s)]
*  ignored a bit, maybe like highly skilled carpenters, but nerdier. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1299.6000000000001s)]
*  I think there's there is some of that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1304.0400000000002s)]
*  I was sort of like taking a broader view of your question. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1305.6000000000001s)]
*  I think finance was like unpopular in the sense of just sort of like niche. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1308.2s)]
*  And then it became extremely central to the world in like 2005 and then it became extremely [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1311.76s)]
*  unpopular. I think extremely unpopular is almost as good as popular in terms of like not [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1317.28s)]
*  being nerdy. If you're if you're a villain, you're not a nerd. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1321.8799999999999s)]
*  But no, I think there is some of that, like, you know, the world, the world is, you know, I [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1325.08s)]
*  say memories are short in finance, but it's actually been 10 years since the crisis. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1330.24s)]
*  Like the world, you know, there's some reason for the world to have found new things to be [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1333.48s)]
*  interested in. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1337.6s)]
*  Here's a question from a reader and I quote, Are there huge bets being made on Wall Street [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1338.52s)]
*  now that could end in something like the CDO, MBS financial crisis debacle? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1343.3999999999999s)]
*  Maybe that I don't know about. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1349.28s)]
*  I think that my general impression is that like the reform of financial regulation since the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1351.32s)]
*  financial crisis has had a lot of its intended effects. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  And one of those is that systemically important financial institutions, by some reasonable [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1360.36s)]
*  definition, probably aren't making huge directional bets on things, like huge lever [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1366.44s)]
*  directional bets on things that aren't sort of traditional banking products anyway. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1371.0s)]
*  So, you know, you never know, right, like what someone's getting up to. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1374.48s)]
*  But like, I'd be surprised if like there are huge lever directional bets existing at [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1378.72s)]
*  regulated financial institutions. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1385.04s)]
*  Do you have a single biggest worry? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1386.92s)]
*  However tiny, tiny, tiny it may be. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1389.72s)]
*  I don't think I do. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1392.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't think I do. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1393.52s)]
*  Like I, the thing that I find weirdest is the lack of volatility in the face of a very [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1394.8s)]
*  strange and volatile world. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1401.92s)]
*  But I've reconciled myself to that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1403.92s)]
*  If you were running the division of this is by like efficient markets, like optimism, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1406.16s)]
*  where like I just, you know, I just, I assume that if someone, if something bad is happening, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1411.24s)]
*  it would happen. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1416.2s)]
*  But efficient markets is also pessimism, right? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1417.04s)]
*  It's harder to make the world better than it already is because you can't see past what [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1419.3999999999999s)]
*  others are seeing very easily. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1423.96s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1426.0s)]
*  It's inefficient markets like conservatism or something. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1426.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1428.48s)]
*  If you're running the division of enforcement at the SEC right now, what would you be telling [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  your people to concentrate on? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1433.2s)]
*  Well, like ICO frauds, like is the simply, it's hard. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1435.3999999999999s)]
*  If they're all informed investors, right? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1439.56s)]
*  Grandmas in this country are not buying ICO so much, let them lose their money to each [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1441.12s)]
*  other or not? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1446.32s)]
*  You know, I just have an aesthetic objection to ICO frauds. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1447.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1450.68s)]
*  I mean, like I think if you're the division of enforcement at the SEC, like your number [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1450.76s)]
*  one priority is protecting uninformed retail investors from, well, very high on your list [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1454.48s)]
*  is protecting uninformed retail investors from fraud. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1461.8799999999999s)]
*  Also pretty high on your list is protecting dumb retail investors from egregious frauds [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1465.48s)]
*  that undermine, that just like, that just make you look bad. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1472.12s)]
*  You know, like there's a sort of like, you know, you don't really want to be the country [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1477.32s)]
*  where people are committing fraud and, you know, running pump and dump groups and talking [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1480.6799999999998s)]
*  about it and having articles written about it and high-fiving each other. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1485.76s)]
*  It doesn't seem to like encourage confidence in the markets. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1488.4799999999998s)]
*  The other thing that like, you know, as the SEC division of enforcement, you might consider [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1491.8799999999999s)]
*  is like larger, more systemic things than retail fraud. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1495.6s)]
*  And I've gone back and forth on this. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1499.92s)]
*  Like, I think that the grandma's losing their pensions to boiler room operators in Florida, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1502.2s)]
*  like is a very clear harm. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1506.64s)]
*  I think, you know, there's a lot of interest in, in among regulators in like the people [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1508.2s)]
*  lying to their customers about large structured credit trades, because those are bigger trades [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1515.76s)]
*  and you can like get bigger penalties because they're, you're defrauding a bank or whatever. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1521.48s)]
*  And I think that like, you know, you have to weigh like the bigness of the potential [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1525.8799999999999s)]
*  harm and like the sort of overall size of the transaction with like how morally and [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1531.76s)]
*  aesthetically abhorrent the transactions are. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1538.32s)]
*  And I think that like the person defrauding the grandma in the boiler room is like very [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  clearly doing something wrong. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1546.28s)]
*  I think there's a lot of gray area behavior in like institutional bond markets that have [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1547.44s)]
*  like that has gotten a lot of focus because it is gray area. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1552.3999999999999s)]
*  So it's more interesting to bring a case if you're an enforcement, you know, if you're [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1556.4799999999998s)]
*  a prosecutor or an enforcer and it's institutional. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1560.04s)]
*  So it's just sort of a sexier thing to deal with and like retail fraud in Florida. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1563.04s)]
*  But in some ways, it's less bang for your buck because you are kind of just like tweaking [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1566.4799999999998s)]
*  the rules in a market that is that is essentially among informed investors who kind of take [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1571.9599999999998s)]
*  care of themselves. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1577.08s)]
*  Now, like you, I'm mostly an efficient markets guy. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1578.1999999999998s)]
*  But when I look at initial public offerings, I'm very baffled because investment banks [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1581.28s)]
*  take such a huge cut. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1586.2s)]
*  If you needed to argue, well, they need the cut because they talk up the security and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1588.04s)]
*  in the absence of their efforts, no one would be interested. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1591.64s)]
*  And it's worth it. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1594.44s)]
*  Maybe that argument works, but it seems somewhat to stand in tension with an efficient [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1595.76s)]
*  markets hypothesis, which suggests the thing will find its appropriate level without any [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1600.1200000000001s)]
*  particular investor having to talk it up. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1605.04s)]
*  And furthermore, attempts to get around the current mainstream system of IPOs have not [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1608.0s)]
*  always been successful. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1612.92s)]
*  Auctions have been tried. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1613.96s)]
*  Israel has tried other methods. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1615.04s)]
*  Spotify is giving it a go. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1616.6000000000001s)]
*  We'll get further data, but they're not obviously doing better. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1618.48s)]
*  But how do you reconcile IPOs in their current form, continuing the investment banks taking [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1622.4s)]
*  such a huge cut and some version of efficient markets hypothesis actually making sense? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1627.16s)]
*  Do you see what I'm asking? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1632.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, how do I reconcile? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1634.28s)]
*  One version of efficient markets is that in the absence of news, the price yesterday is [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1636.4s)]
*  going to be the price today or whatever. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1641.2s)]
*  I think there's some sort of like continuity of prices and the IPO is a huge discontinuity. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1642.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1648.2s)]
*  I mean, like you don't have a price and then you have a price. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1648.48s)]
*  And so you'd sort of like if your notion of efficient markets is like a sort of straight [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1650.76s)]
*  line of like the price not moving very much or like if the price, you know, sort of instantly [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1655.0400000000002s)]
*  incorporating information, you sort of it's not unintuitive that you'd have a big squiggle [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1659.1200000000001s)]
*  at the start, right? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1663.64s)]
*  Like that you wouldn't really know what the price is for three days and then you would. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1665.48s)]
*  And so that's like, I don't think it's unusual that like the first trade of a stock would not [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1669.76s)]
*  be the price that it settles to in a week. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1677.16s)]
*  But then the second week would be pretty close to the first. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1678.96s)]
*  But that the direction is so predictable, though, that's odd. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1681.32s)]
*  The pop, right? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1684.3600000000001s)]
*  The direction. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  So, so there's sure. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1685.84s)]
*  But that's like, like what's happening. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1688.72s)]
*  One thing that's happening is that the banks are doing the thing that create that they're [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1692.2s)]
*  doing the work they're getting paid for, which is going out to a bunch of buyers and talking [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1696.4s)]
*  about the stock and sort of trying to to generate a price. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1699.8s)]
*  And that work is is like sort of non-efficient markets for it. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1702.96s)]
*  It's like M&A work where it's like there's no like sort of visible price and you're sort [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1708.68s)]
*  of negotiating one off with big investors. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1712.52s)]
*  And then once they have that price, they sell it for less. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1716.2s)]
*  And that's not really true. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1722.04s)]
*  But that's kind of like intuitively what's happening is that once they have that price, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1722.76s)]
*  they sell it for less for a variety of reasons. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1726.68s)]
*  Right. Like you're like the stories for it are I think somewhat compelling. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1729.56s)]
*  Right. I mean, it's like you sell. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1733.32s)]
*  You want a pop because you want the early investors to be rewarded for taking a leap [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1735.4s)]
*  of faith in the company. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1740.52s)]
*  That's like maybe a little silly and like a giant IPO. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1741.24s)]
*  But like it's not that silly and like a tiny IPO where there's like some hair on it and [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1743.88s)]
*  where it's a small company and you have to give someone some expectation of returns to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1747.24s)]
*  get interested. And yeah, I mean, I think that work before the pop that figure out what [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1751.64s)]
*  the thing is worth and worth and selling it to investors and doing research and everything. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1756.68s)]
*  That's like what the banks are getting paid for. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1759.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. Like the pop is not the same thing as the bank's fee. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1761.16s)]
*  Right. The bank is like doing work to try to get to a reasonable price. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1763.96s)]
*  And then they're selling it for 15 percent less than that price. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1767.72s)]
*  The other thing about the pop is that investors in the IPO have an interest in the stock going up. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1770.92s)]
*  The sellers in the IPO have no interest in the stock going down. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1775.72s)]
*  Right. It's bad for them. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1779.0s)]
*  It's bad for them for a variety of reasons. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1780.28s)]
*  The main one being that they are keeping most of the stock and they don't want the stock to go down. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1783.32s)]
*  And so when you have that set of dynamics, no one is sad when the stock goes up. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1787.48s)]
*  Everyone's sad if the stock goes down. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1791.6399999999999s)]
*  Why would you over price it? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1793.24s)]
*  Now, Matt speaks Latin and he was a classics major as an undergraduate at Harvard. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1795.16s)]
*  I don't really speak Latin. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1799.72s)]
*  You once told me that law was easier than classics. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1800.9199999999998s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1804.28s)]
*  I mean, they're both like sort of, you know, like the activity that you do in your academic [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1805.72s)]
*  job as an undergraduate or law student is like sort of sitting around analyzing dense texts. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1811.8s)]
*  But like in law, they're mostly in English. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1816.84s)]
*  Right. So like that's a big, it's just very straightforward. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1818.6799999999998s)]
*  Like if you're not raised speaking ancient Greek, it is much easier to read even like a [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1821.8799999999999s)]
*  19th century legal decision than to read, you know, Thucydides. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1828.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1833.64s)]
*  I mean, like law is so, so just like embedded in our society and like sort of like, you know, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1834.1200000000001s)]
*  you grow up watching, you know, Law and Order or whatever, right? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1839.64s)]
*  Like there's a sort of like, it is like, it is very much part of like the fabric of how we live. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1841.8000000000002s)]
*  Whereas, you know, reading Greek poetry when I was in college was an extremely niche activity. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1847.48s)]
*  And so required a little bit more investment to just kind of like come up to any familiarity with it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1854.36s)]
*  Now I brought my copy of Horace's epistles to this conversation. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1860.04s)]
*  It's been terrifying me all night. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1864.4399999999998s)]
*  And I actually think of a lot of your Bloomberg writings as being a kind of modernized Horace. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1867.0s)]
*  So you read Horace, there's a preoccupation with wealth, with law. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1873.0s)]
*  There's a humor in it, the way he segues from one topic to another. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1877.0s)]
*  There are even mixed feelings on how the pursuit of wealth would translate into happiness. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1881.16s)]
*  The length of a lot of Horace's letters is actually about the same as the length of some [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1885.64s)]
*  of your Bloomberg columns. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1891.0s)]
*  So there's a little quiz here. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1892.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to read a few sentences and you need to tell me where they written by Horace [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1893.8000000000002s)]

*  Thumbs up Horace. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1958.28s)]
*  I feel like when you're an undergraduate, a classics major, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1963.0s)]
*  you read like Horace and Catullus are sort of paired with each other. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1966.12s)]
*  And Catullus is the like, sort of like hotheaded young romantic [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1970.12s)]
*  who wrote sort of like quasi pornographic love poems. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1974.12s)]
*  And Horace is the like sort of older wiser, like, you know, backed away from the world. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1978.28s)]
*  You know, like the famous Horace love poems are sort of more cynical [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1984.84s)]
*  and more eddory move from the world. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1988.6s)]
*  And that's something I also admire and attempt to emulate in my own work to be like a little, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1991.16s)]
*  like I'm probably like, you know, I tell people I'm an opinion columnist and I don't have any [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=1998.3600000000001s)]

*  engagement. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2006.3600000000001s)]
*  As is often the case in some of the Latin classics. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2007.16s)]
*  Now, what's the best thing you've read or re-read in Latin in the last five years? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2011.16s)]
*  I don't read a lot of Latin in the last five years. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2016.44s)]
*  I mean, the answer honestly is, is, is, and the answer is because I don't read a lot is [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2019.48s)]
*  Horace Ode's one five is the sort of famous crisp, multi-agraculis tape who are in Rosa. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2026.36s)]
*  It's the sort of most famous world weary renunciatory Horatian love poem. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2032.44s)]
*  It's good stuff. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2038.28s)]
*  What do Latin speakers and readers get about ancient Rome that non-Latin speakers miss? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2040.28s)]
*  I don't have like a substantive answer. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2045.64s)]
*  What you get is like a sort of sense of like what I took from like a classical education is [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2048.6s)]
*  like this like sense of like direct engagement with like humans who lived 2000 years ago, right? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2054.2799999999997s)]
*  Of like a, like a being able to like Cicero's letters are like a sort of classic piece of [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2061.72s)]
*  Latin literature because Cicero is this like sort of like famous like stern orator who like, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2066.52s)]
*  you know, are these very serious law court speeches. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2071.88s)]
*  But then he also has a lot of letters that have come down to us and there's some of them are [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2075.08s)]
*  for publicity and some of them are much more personal, but like they're all [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2079.16s)]
*  at least ostensibly personal. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2083.08s)]
*  And like you get the sense of like this actual human who's this like sort of [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2084.44s)]
*  famous figure and this famous lawmaker, but like you experience his consciousness more directly [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2087.7200000000003s)]
*  in his language. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  And that to me was like just sort of like the weird and interesting part of being a classics [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2094.36s)]
*  major was just like being able to sit with people from 2000 years ago and [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2100.68s)]
*  see how many of their concerns are similar and see how many of their concerns are so [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2107.64s)]
*  different and so weird in a pretty direct way. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2111.3199999999997s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly Now as you Matt know in every conversation [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2114.2799999999997s)]
*  with Tyler, there's a middle segment called underrated versus overrated. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2117.24s)]
*  I toss something out. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2121.08s)]
*  You tell me if it's underrated or overrated. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2122.12s)]
*  You're always free to pass, of course. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2124.36s)]
*  And the first one is writing in legalese. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2126.68s)]
*  Underrated or overrated? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2131.16s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly You know, under like, I mean, it's not great, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2132.44s)]
*  but like underrated, I would say. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2136.2799999999997s)]
*  Like I think that like in general people, like I don't know what that means, but like in general, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2137.7999999999997s)]
*  people are like too quick to criticize jargon and legalese and all these things. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2141.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2146.6s)]
*  I mean, like there's often a set of technical meanings that are just easier and more efficient [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2146.8399999999997s)]
*  to use when you're using the jargon of a field. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2154.12s)]
*  And I think aesthetic criticisms of legalese are often overblown. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2157.24s)]
*  That said, I read some really bad like legal writing and like some mixed feelings, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2163.16s)]
*  but like that's under. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2167.08s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly Legal realism, overrated or underrated? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2168.2799999999997s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly It feels like it's gone from the academy [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2171.08s)]
*  and it's gone from, you know, it's not something that people talk about in daily life. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2173.8799999999997s)]
*  And I, you know, to me, it explains everything. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2178.3599999999997s)]
*  So I'd say under. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2180.3599999999997s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly Buffy the vampire slayer. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2181.08s)]

*  I mean, you know, well, like highly rated, but like, but comparative, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2184.84s)]
*  like among the most important American cultural products and not rated that way. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2189.32s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly What makes it special? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2194.28s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly What makes it? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2195.88s)]
*  It's, you know, like part of it is like, you know, you go back and watch it and it's not as [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2197.08s)]
*  good as you think because like it has had such an influence on later things that, that, that, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2202.6000000000004s)]
*  like the, it's, it's shockiness has been attenuated. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2207.2400000000002s)]
*  So part of it is just its influence on, on subsequent television. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2210.44s)]
*  But it's, it's like, it's a, it's a perfect example of dealing very intelligently with [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2213.96s)]
*  serious themes in a way that on its surface and particularly in its title is silly. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2221.4s)]
*  Right. And so, and is, and is, is not presented as serious, which I think is obviously something that [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2228.28s)]
*  I often aspire to do. But I also think it's just something that like the internet aspires to do. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2235.4s)]
*  I think a lot of like just sort of like modern internet culture has that sort of vein of like [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2242.04s)]
*  using colloquial language and being casual, but like, you know, attempting to address [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2247.88s)]
*  more serious issues. And I think, you know, Buffy didn't invent that, but Buffy is such a, like, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2253.96s)]
*  is a cultural touchstone for some of that approach. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2259.32s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly Harkening back to the Romans, Virgil's [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2261.64s)]
*  magnum opus, the Aeonid. Overrated? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2264.2s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly Yeah, sure. Overrated. You know, I, I've, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2266.76s)]
*  I told you, I, you know, when I was in college, I did a summer program in Rome run by father [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2270.2s)]
*  Reginald Foster, who was the Latin secretary to the Pope. And he does this, he's a Carmelite [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2276.3599999999997s)]
*  friar from Wisconsin. And he would have a program for everyone who wants to come and read and speak [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2282.3599999999997s)]
*  Latin. And we read some gorgeous passage of Abed and he concluded, and he said, isn't that nice? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2286.2799999999997s)]
*  Isn't that better than Virgil? Virgil is gray and wicked. Virgil, I was always biased against [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2292.6s)]
*  Virgil after that. But he was, you know, so this is not true, but like he was a propagandist. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2298.76s)]
*  I mean, it's sort of like a, you know, I don't know. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2303.4s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly What's the most underrated neighborhood of New York City? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2305.8s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly I was saying, I don't, I don't have an answer to that because I've only [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2309.1600000000003s)]
*  lived in extremely highly rated neighborhoods. I live in Park Slope now, which some magazine a [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2312.44s)]
*  few years ago declared the best neighborhood in America, which like, it would be hard to argue. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2316.92s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly It may be better yet. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2320.5200000000004s)]

*  like Gowanus. Maybe I'd say Gowanus is underrated. It's like a great like food destination. It's [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2325.88s)]
*  like, God create like, like industrial chic architecture. It's sort of Gowanus. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2330.6800000000003s)]

*  A lot of footnotes started in medieval times as commentary on the Latin classics, of course, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2342.92s)]
*  including Horace. Dr. John B. Reilly [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2347.48s)]
*  Sure. I mean, like the notion of like a sort of like, like intertextuality or like, you know, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2349.96s)]
*  having multiple lines of the text, like having a main line and having asides as a sort of valuable [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2357.48s)]
*  notion. And one that I think has been like kind of valorized by internet writing in a way, right? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2364.44s)]
*  Like, I think it's just easier to have links you have, you know, you can the notion of having like [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2371.0s)]
*  a single narrative with no distractions and having that be the sort of like highest achievement of [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2376.6s)]
*  writing is I think a little diminished by the internet and then therefore footnotes have become [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2381.56s)]
*  more appropriately valued. Dr. John B. Reilly [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2387.3199999999997s)]
*  What financial stories or issues do you think are not getting enough coverage and why? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2388.8399999999997s)]
*  Dr. John B. Reilly It's hard for me to answer questions like that because I'm such a creature [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2393.08s)]
*  of coverage. Like I wake up and I read the news and I write about it. So I rarely take a step back. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2396.2s)]
*  But I don't know, like the thing that I would like to read and hear more about is, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2402.28s)]
*  it came to this from a bank. And I think banks are interesting objects. Like banks and hedge funds [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2406.6000000000004s)]
*  are not like perfect substitutes. Like banks do something interesting. And there's a lot about it, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2412.1200000000003s)]
*  but I'd be interested in seeing more because I don't feel like I have a good answer. I'm like, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2417.0s)]
*  what will happen to banks? Like what, you know, we're in the early days of, it seems to be pretty [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2420.6000000000004s)]
*  wholesale financial deregulation. And obviously banks in 2006 were different places from what [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2427.0s)]
*  they are now. And one possibility is they'll go back to doing exactly what they did in 2006. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2433.16s)]
*  Right. Another possibility is they'll go back to doing something precisely analogous to that, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2438.36s)]
*  but in totally different instruments and ways and whatever, but like will be similarly freewheeling, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2442.84s)]
*  fascinating, dangerous places. Another possibility is that like something like a switch has been [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2448.28s)]
*  effectively flipped in the culture and they won't go back. And I just don't know. And I'd love to, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2454.92s)]
*  I think that banks have become very boring. I think like the coverage of like what banks are [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2461.16s)]
*  doing to be more interesting is like, you know, things have moved on to like more interesting [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2465.96s)]
*  places. You know, there's a million articles about Bitcoin and it's possible that banks will be [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2469.2400000000002s)]
*  becoming more interesting. And I don't have a handle on the ways in which they're doing that. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2473.88s)]
*  Bloomberg aside, who would you say is under followed as a writer? Not counting our colleagues. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2478.6s)]
*  I always want to pass on these. Like I was just like, forget people. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2484.2s)]
*  Ovid once wrote in our leisure, we reveal what kind of people we are. Do you agree? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2488.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess. Yeah, sure. I mean, right. I, in my leisure, I, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2494.52s)]
*  I read the internet and do crossword puzzles and hang out with my daughter. I'm pretty boring. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2499.0s)]
*  Just probably accurate. You once wrote, I think this was a speculation rather than a definitive [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2505.64s)]
*  pronouncement, but you wrote everything is, I think more and more about how all of Western [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2511.0s)]
*  culture is a footnote to Iliad book nine. What did you mean? I have a sort of idiosyncratic take on [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2515.64s)]
*  book nine of the Iliad. You know, the Iliad is the story of like Achilles is, is the great warrior [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2523.24s)]
*  on the Greek side in the Trojan war. And he gets mad at some slight and he goes back to his tent to [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2529.48s)]
*  sulk and the Greeks start losing. And so then they send emissaries to his tent to say, please [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2534.84s)]
*  come back. And he says no. And then the Greeks start losing some more and he eventually comes back [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2542.2000000000003s)]
*  and he gets killed. And that's basically the story of the Iliad. And in book nine is the, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2547.32s)]
*  where they send the emissaries to say, please come back. And he says no. And, and he gives this [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2551.7200000000003s)]
*  speech, this response that is weird where he says, you know, effectively the prophecy is that if I [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2557.8s)]
*  go back to fight here, I will die here and my name will be immortal. And if I go home, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2566.2s)]
*  I don't go back to fight. I'll go home and live a long life and I'll be forgotten. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2572.36s)]
*  And he chooses to go back and be forgotten. And then later he changes his mind because his friend [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2576.44s)]
*  gets killed. And this like crux point of the Iliad is this like the existential almost like [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2580.76s)]
*  examination of like, like, you know, this, this Greek warrior in this heroic culture that, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2588.1200000000003s)]
*  that, you know, like clearly valorizes like heroism and deathless fame and everything. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2594.1200000000003s)]
*  And who is like the, you know, canonically the most famous heroic warrior and the one with the [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2600.1200000000003s)]
*  most deathless fame. He's the one who says, he says, nah, I'd rather go back and live a long life [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2605.4s)]
*  on my farm. And, you know, the, the, the forcing of that choice is like the central point of like [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2609.88s)]
*  the, the highest work of Greek art prefigures a lot of like existentialists and sort of like [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2615.48s)]
*  thought in the future. I think what makes Nabokov's Pinyin an interesting novel. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2622.36s)]
*  I'm reading my secret. I'll not put a link up to it. It's just very like [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2629.0s)]
*  Nabokovian. It's just like a bunch of, you know, he's just this great like [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2635.6400000000003s)]
*  esthete of like, of like sort of almost pointless pleasure in writing. And so there's this, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2640.1200000000003s)]
*  there's this scene that I love where Pinyin, the like absent-minded professor character is like [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2645.7200000000003s)]
*  heartbroken after I run in with his, with his ex-wife and he's like dejectedly walking through [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2651.6400000000003s)]
*  the park on the way home and he's pondering the meaning of life. And Nabokov says something like, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2657.96s)]
*  he's almost come upon a sort of solution to one of the great mysteries of life. And then [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2662.92s)]
*  he's interrupted by a squirrel who runs up on a water fountain and demands that he help the [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2667.08s)]
*  squirrel drink from the water fountain. And like, and so he helps the squirrel and then he moves on. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2671.56s)]
*  And so it's just like sort of random interlude of just gorgeous writing and bizarre [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2676.1200000000003s)]
*  scenery and just sort of like random pileup of weird delightfulness with no point that I [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2680.44s)]
*  find very appealing. If we think about mergers and acquisitions, one of the standard results [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2687.7999999999997s)]
*  in the empirical finance literature is that acquiring firms do fairly poorly. That is, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2692.8399999999997s)]
*  acquisitions don't seem to pay off. Yet of course, acquisitions persist and you've done [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2698.68s)]
*  M&A work in your life. How do you think about this process? If it doesn't pay off, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2704.2s)]
*  is it about empire building? Is it about winner's curse? Do you somehow not trust the data? You [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2709.16s)]
*  would challenge the interpretation of the result or how good are acquisitions for the acquiring [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2714.2s)]
*  firm and what goes wrong? So I wouldn't challenge the data. I mean, like, to me, like, it's like a [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2719.48s)]
*  similar story to active management in some ways, right? Like the fact that M&A is bad doesn't mean [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2726.6s)]
*  that your merger will be bad, right? And so like, there's a sort of, so one, there's like, obviously [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2732.9199999999996s)]
*  a bias towards empire building, right? And then two, you can, you don't, you don't say that, right? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2738.52s)]
*  You're not like, well, I'd like to have a bigger company to run. What you say is this merger will [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2743.48s)]
*  be good and you believe it, right? And, and like the data is not overwhelming that all mergers are [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2747.48s)]
*  bad, right? The data is like, you know, on average, they're a little bad. And so you say, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2754.2s)]
*  here are the reasons why we are better, right? And so everyone can say that and 49% of them will be [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2757.72s)]
*  right. And you throw in some empire building and it's a, people want to do stuff, you know, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2763.32s)]
*  it's, it's, I think it's very similar to the active management story. You want to do stuff, you [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2769.7200000000003s)]
*  see an active manager who seems smart, has a good rating, right? Like you see a charismatic banker [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2774.04s)]
*  or charismatic corporate development guy or whatever, and you want to do some stuff and then [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2778.2000000000003s)]
*  you can, you can persuade yourself that you're in the 49%. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2782.52s)]
*  The Shad Johnson agreement, should the SEC and CFTC be independent agencies or should they be [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2785.48s)]
*  combined into one? I don't have a strong view on that. I mean, I don't see a compelling [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2792.92s)]
*  difference among them, but I also, you know, like if you combine them, there'd be [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2800.2000000000003s)]
*  departments for commodities and departments for equities and, you know, like you split off the [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2806.92s)]
*  SEC into like this, the equities and like the bond department tomorrow. Like the, I'm not sure that, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2812.6s)]
*  I'm not sure what the institutional dynamics are that matter very much. I suspect that most of the [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2817.56s)]
*  time the agencies are like roughly on board with each other and are sort of like broadly like, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2823.72s)]
*  like how much regulation should there be sort of perspective? Obviously there are times that [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2832.04s)]
*  there aren't, right? The CFTC fighting against derivatives in the, you know, early 2000s is a [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2836.52s)]
*  famous example of that, but I think like in general, I'm not, I'm not sure like what the [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2842.52s)]
*  dynamics are where it matters that much one way or the other. Is American financial regulation [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2845.88s)]
*  too federalistic and too fragmented or not? You know, in my experience, the existence of [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2849.88s)]
*  like state financial regulation was only like a weird footnote, but I think in general it is [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2858.04s)]
*  almost certainly too federalistic and fragmented. And the particular, the example that was not [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2863.8s)]
*  core to my experience as a person in finance is insurance regulation. It's like very clearly [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2868.84s)]
*  too state-based and fragmented and gameable. And I think that there are probably some [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2874.68s)]
*  securities cases that are, that are similar, but like the insurance regulation is kind of the big [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2879.7999999999997s)]
*  one. And then like, you could argue that corporate law should be federalized. So I don't think that [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2884.2799999999997s)]
*  there's a huge case for that just because in practice corporate law is a creature of Delaware. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2888.2s)]
*  And so it's essentially, there's only one corporate law anyway. And what's the most overrated [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2893.8799999999997s)]
*  neighborhood in New York City? I don't know. Why is William Gaddis an interesting writer? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2899.0s)]
*  Why is William Gaddis an interesting writer? Cause he's part of that, like it's part of like the, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2906.2s)]
*  I don't know, there's like a, there's like a period of like interesting modernist experimentation [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2912.36s)]
*  that sort of, I feel like the peak of it was like from like Joyce through like, you know, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2916.84s)]
*  mid fifties or something. And I think Gaddis is the sort of like most contemporary, like weird [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2922.44s)]
*  writer, like weird kind of like mid-century esoteric. Yeah. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2927.56s)]
*  You know, I sometimes like to say, Matt Levine, only you can do what you do. So my final question [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2932.68s)]
*  is about what I call the Matt Levine production function. So, so many days in the week, early in [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2939.16s)]
*  the morning, typically you have produced something that is perfectly clear and lucid and witty and [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2945.64s)]
*  informative and original. So many days over the course of a year, more than anyone else I know, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2951.24s)]
*  spanning law, economics, finance, history, other things. So there are many facets of your day in [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2957.48s)]
*  your work routines, but if you had to explain to someone, what is the Matt Levine production [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2964.2000000000003s)]
*  function? What is it you would draw our attention to? I think like a lot of people, a lot of it is [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2968.76s)]
*  panic. And I'm just sort of like, you know, like I talk about, you know, I, um, I, at various points, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2973.4s)]
*  thought of being a law professor. I thought of being a classics professor and I never could write [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2979.0s)]
*  papers. Like I turned in my final paper in law school, like two weeks after graduation. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2984.28s)]
*  And when I thought about leaving my job as a banker to become a blogger, my girlfriend, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2988.44s)]
*  now wife was like, remember how you didn't write your papers in law school? Are you sure you want [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2993.8s)]
*  to do this? And, uh, and you know, like what I think is like people have like the, their like [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=2998.76s)]
*  proper metabolism for producing stuff. And like, for me, I wouldn't say it's easy. It's like [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3005.1600000000003s)]
*  incredibly difficult to put it as like reliable that I can produce something in a panic every day. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3010.2s)]
*  Whereas if I think, I think if I had to produce something every week and I have some experience [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3016.7599999999998s)]
*  with this, I have to produce something every week, I do it about every three weeks. So that's like, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3020.2s)]
*  one thing is just the sort of drive of panic. The other thing is like, I try to be pretty ruthlessly [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3024.2s)]
*  focused on places where I have an advantage or where I like can add value. And like, I try not [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3031.0s)]
*  like nice thing. One nice thing about working at Bloomberg is that there's like, like if I [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3037.88s)]
*  don't write about something, someone else will write about it. So I don't ever write about things [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3042.36s)]
*  because like someone needs to write about it, right? Like if I read about it, it's because I [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3046.12s)]
*  have something to say about it. And that I think is a rare and valuable flexibility to have. Like [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3049.48s)]
*  my beat is not, you know, I'm not like doing things because I have to do them. Those are, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3054.76s)]
*  those are main things. I mean, the other thing that I have is like, I worked on this weird [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3059.6400000000003s)]
*  derivatives desk at a bank where I was as an investment banker. So I covered corporate [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3064.76s)]
*  clients and I went to meet with corporate clients with like coverage bankers who did M&A. But I was [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3070.76s)]
*  also selling them equity derivatives products, which were booked against our trading desk and [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3075.0800000000004s)]
*  where we were acting as a principal. And I was also underwriting Convertible Bonds. I was seeing a [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3079.5600000000004s)]
*  lot of different sides of banks, of the bank and exposed to a lot of different like ways of being [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3083.5600000000004s)]
*  in finance, right? I mean, like the life of an investment banker is very different from the life [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3090.2000000000003s)]
*  of a vol trader. And I was sort of like, to some extent bridging those lives, which was helpful. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3093.72s)]
*  The other thing I was doing is I was explaining fairly complicated products to smart people who [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3098.8399999999997s)]
*  did not know anything about them. And so you'd go to a CFO and be like, what you want to do is an [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3106.4399999999996s)]
*  uncapped collared ASB with, you know, the variable maturity. And they'd be like, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3112.2799999999997s)]
*  and then you'd have to explain to them not what the thing was, because they don't care like what [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3117.48s)]
*  the set of legal documents are, but what the like economic intuitions behind it are. And so [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3124.6800000000003s)]
*  that like explaining economic intuitions to a smart person about a thing that is complicated [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3131.08s)]
*  is I think valuable in my current job. The other thing that was valuable about that is that the [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3136.84s)]
*  economic intuitions I was explaining to the CFO were not necessarily the economic intuitions that [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3141.1600000000003s)]
*  we had. Like, we were doing the trade for something for some exposure that we wanted or some [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3145.96s)]
*  set of payoffs that we got. And they were doing the trade for some other set of payoffs. And it [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3151.16s)]
*  wasn't like we were betting against them. It was like we had sort of two sort of overlapping set [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3155.08s)]
*  of interests in the trade. And so having some awareness of that is useful in sort of looking [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3160.28s)]
*  at complicated financial things that like different people can be getting something different [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3165.88s)]
*  and complicated out of a trade that is not necessarily described in the public documents [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3170.44s)]
*  for that trade. Matt Levine, only you can do what you do. And thank you for the conversation. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3177.48s)]
*  We now do have some time for questions. I will call on you. A mic will come to you. Please note, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3187.48s)]
*  these are questions, not speeches. The goal is to hear from Matt Levine. I will cut you off if need [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3193.32s)]
*  be. So questions for Matt. There's one right here. Thanks a lot. I just had it on the topic [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3199.72s)]
*  of efficient markets and crypto assets. I wonder if you think it's possible that the prices of many [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3206.8399999999997s)]
*  of these assets are far too high now. And if that might be because the risks of buying and the risks [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3212.9199999999996s)]
*  of selling are very different and whether in particular, whether there's other assets, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3218.7599999999998s)]
*  like say binary options or something that might result in more accurate lower prices. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3224.2s)]
*  I'll preface by saying in general, I'm an efficient markets believer. I never want to be like, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3228.44s)]
*  oh, these cryptos are too highly valued and they're all going to crash to zero because [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3233.88s)]
*  what do I know? That said, do I think that there are some, let's say, technical reasons that a lot [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3238.44s)]
*  of crypto assets are too highly valued? I do think that there are some obvious limits to arbitrage. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3244.12s)]
*  One is that there's a perception that it's hard to short a lot of crypto assets. Some people tell [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3248.84s)]
*  me that's not true and you can borrow Bitcoin, no problem. But there is a perception that it's [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3253.7200000000003s)]
*  hard to short them. Even if it's easy to borrow them, it's always more dangerous to short something [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3257.64s)]
*  super volatile than to belong something super volatile. The other thing that I don't really [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3263.7999999999997s)]
*  understand about Bitcoin is exchange withdrawal limits that make it seem like there are a lot [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3268.12s)]
*  of places where you can buy Bitcoin and then not sell it, nevermind shorting, but where it is very [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3275.8799999999997s)]
*  easy to put as much money as you want into an exchange to buy as many Bitcoins as you want. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3281.72s)]
*  But selling those Bitcoins and taking your cash out is a more complicated and lengthier process. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3285.48s)]
*  I don't know that's true at all exchanges, but it's clearly true at some exchanges. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3290.04s)]
*  So yeah, I think there are some technical factors that probably lead to Bitcoin overvaluation. Can [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3292.84s)]
*  technical things solve that? Maybe. The spread between futures and caches converge would suggest [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3298.44s)]
*  that there is some price discovery going on in the futures market and maybe it is being helpful in [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3303.8s)]
*  Bitcoin. I've never heard an argument that binary options make pricing more efficient in any asset [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3309.16s)]
*  class, but who knows. Next question is here in the front. If you could bring the mic. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3314.04s)]
*  My question for you, Matt, is how do you avoid writing on political topics when it feels like [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3318.84s)]
*  that's what the whole rest of the world is talking about? Or does an editor just kind of [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3324.7599999999998s)]
*  strike the paragraphs right before posting? No, quite the opposite. Sometimes I strike the [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3328.44s)]
*  paragraphs right before posting, but not often. I don't know. I think it's actually pretty easy [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3333.88s)]
*  to avoid writing what everyone else is writing about. As I said to Tyler, my interest is [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3337.56s)]
*  in places where I have an advantage. It seems to me that even if I write a really good take on Trump, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3343.6400000000003s)]
*  it will only be the 50th best take on Trump of the 12,000 written that morning. Whereas [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3352.84s)]
*  if I write about Kodak coin, I'll be only one of 20 people writing about Kodak. If I write about [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3360.84s)]
*  gaming of FERC regulations, I might be alone. You don't want to only write about total esoterica, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3369.08s)]
*  but I think it's really easy to figure that people are full up on Trump news and want something else. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3376.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that's empirically true because people, when I do occasionally write about political news, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3384.2799999999997s)]
*  people email me like, man, your newsletter is such a nice relief from political news. I'm so mad [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3388.68s)]
*  that you wrote about Trump today. Front row, there's a question. Where in midtown was an extreme [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3392.52s)]
*  clustering of the finance industry, an industry where rarely do we actually need to meet each [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3398.12s)]
*  other? Do you think that will grow, continue, decay? I guess it'll decay. I worked as an [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3402.8399999999997s)]
*  investment banker and there is something in high dollar sales about people really believe in [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3410.8399999999997s)]
*  in-person meetings. I experienced that where I'd go to a meeting where a colleague would dial in [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3416.7599999999998s)]
*  and you could tell how much better my experience was in the room than her experience was on the [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3422.52s)]
*  phone. I think that on the one hand, to the extent that trading consists of computers trading with [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3427.56s)]
*  each other, it does seem somewhat unnecessary that we all sit within 10 blocks of each other. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3434.92s)]
*  On the other hand, to the extent that finance is the business of M&A and of very high dollar [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3439.0s)]
*  sales businesses, I'm not sure that it's as amenable to fragmentation as you might think. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3443.96s)]
*  Three rows back, this question in the middle. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3449.64s)]
*  Apologies for another crypto question. To me, the fact that Bitcoin took off [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3452.36s)]
*  some would say because it has a fixed supply has made me question even how much low and stable [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3457.16s)]
*  inflation has political costs. My question would be, how has the rise of crypto changed your mind [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3462.3599999999997s)]
*  about some of your beliefs around finance and economics? It's hard. I mean, in some ways, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3467.56s)]
*  I think it is probably at the margin weakened my general view of myself as an efficient market [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3474.3599999999997s)]
*  fundamentalist. I mean, it just feels so weird. It feels so weird and it feels so like, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3481.4s)]
*  when you say that you believe in efficient markets, one aspect of that is believing in [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3487.1600000000003s)]
*  that markets incorporate fundamental information in some way. That's whatever Bitcoin is doing, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3491.56s)]
*  it's not that. It is just weird on that basis. Beyond that, I don't know. This is not a good [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3496.92s)]
*  answer, but I'm used to believing in a financial system where it's not just a series of actors [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3505.8s)]
*  but where there is a sociological set of connections between the banks do this and [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3511.32s)]
*  the prime brokers do this and the hedge funds do this and the retail investors do that. There's [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3516.2000000000003s)]
*  this very structured system and Bitcoin really is just spike that is totally unrelated to that [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3519.56s)]
*  system and that has nonetheless had pretty big impact and also had pretty big impact on that [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3527.1600000000003s)]
*  system where all the actors in that system are recalibrating themselves. That's just a weird, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3533.8s)]
*  I wouldn't have guessed that ex-Bitcoin, if you had said, can some fintech new entrant [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3539.2400000000002s)]
*  disrupt banking or whatever? I'd have been like, it's really hard. They'll have relationships [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3545.1600000000003s)]
*  already. Bitcoin is a pretty good argument that something big can disrupt the financial system. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3549.2400000000002s)]
*  Edith Poynter Next question. Yes, here. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3554.04s)]
*  Peter Bell Thank you. If we were to look at the most frequent words used on this stage, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3556.44s)]
*  I'm guessing that weird would be probably one of the most popular. What's your framework for [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3562.28s)]
*  deciding whether something is weird? I don't know that I have one. It's just like if it matches with [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3566.6s)]
*  my prior intuitions. I like weird, so when I use weird, it's often just a synonym for interesting [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3572.2s)]
*  and it's just my own. I wouldn't say I have a framework. What I would say is that whatever [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3579.16s)]
*  set of biases I have to find things interesting and weird and funny and quirky, I just write about it [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3583.96s)]
*  and that seems to have resonated with some audience, but I'm not sure that I can articulate [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3590.7599999999998s)]
*  what that framework is. Edith Poynter [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3596.04s)]
*  Next question. Hi. What's a rule that should be amended or repealed? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3597.88s)]
*  Peter Bell It should always be prepared for these things. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3603.16s)]
*  I don't know. I'm going to give a weird one, which is this is not an answer to your question, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3606.92s)]
*  but I've been thinking a lot recently about regulation FD, which is the rule that says [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3612.68s)]
*  that companies can't disclose material nonpublic information to one investor unless they've [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3617.08s)]
*  simultaneously disclosed it to all of their investors. It seems like a very straightforward [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3621.72s)]
*  fairness rule and which is the weird aspect of it is that companies meet constantly with [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3626.52s)]
*  their investors and their investors are very excited to meet with them and want research [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3634.68s)]
*  analysts to set up these meetings. There's a whole economy of these meetings and yet they're [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3639.8799999999997s)]
*  never disclosing material nonpublic information and then the investors leave those meetings and [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3643.8799999999997s)]
*  go trade. It's like, well, they didn't learn anything in those meetings. It's a striking [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3648.28s)]
*  set of facts. What I think is striking about it is that it's clearly how the world should work [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3652.6800000000003s)]
*  that companies should talk to the people who own them and those people should be able to ask [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3659.7200000000003s)]
*  questions and propose and say, hey, you should really be doing this and then watch the executives [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3665.48s)]
*  reactions. Yet at the same time, the law says you can't do it. I don't know how I would amend it, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3670.6800000000003s)]
*  but I think that there is a tension between the existence of this rule that on its face you would [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3677.64s)]
*  think would prohibit substantive meetings between companies and their investors and the lived [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3682.44s)]
*  practice of finance in which companies meet with their investors and have investor relations [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3687.48s)]
*  departments and are owned by those investors and have fiduciary duties to those investors. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3692.2s)]
*  It would be strange if they never met with them, but it's also strange that they do meet with them [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3696.7599999999998s)]
*  because this rule exists that you would think would cast a shadow on those meetings. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3700.2s)]
*  Next question. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3706.92s)]
*  You write pretty frequently on information security and hacks. Are we as worried as we should be about [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3708.36s)]
*  that? And non-sequitur, have we reached peak beard? I was noticing when we were backstage at Shipley and [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3713.08s)]
*  we both have beards, I guess we're at... My beard is cyclical. My beard runs from like [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3720.6800000000003s)]
*  end of December through like spring. I suppose we're at the peak of my own beard cycle. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3728.2000000000003s)]
*  I have no expertise in information security. It seems overwhelmingly likely to me that we're [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3735.56s)]
*  not worried enough about hacks because when I occasionally read people who are experts, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3739.56s)]
*  they're like, the world will end and you will die horribly because you don't change your password. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3745.3199999999997s)]
*  They're probably telling the truth and I don't change my password. So I'm certain that the [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3750.3599999999997s)]
*  answer to your question is we're not sufficiently worried about hacks. There was a story that I just [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3754.44s)]
*  saw the headline that someone conducted a successful jackpot attack on a US ATM, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3759.56s)]
*  which means that you do the thing where you somehow get the ATM to give you all the money [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3765.0s)]
*  that was in the ATM. And that seems like a good hack. I always read about bank hacks and they're [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3769.4s)]
*  like, well, they had this bank and they got some email addresses and now they're sending them spam. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3776.12s)]
*  And I'm like, that doesn't seem like a very good hack. But in some time frame, they'll get the [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3780.28s)]
*  money and then that'll be really bad. Not just because they'll take money from a bank, but [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3786.68s)]
*  our whole world exists on a series of computers. And if you hack one of those computers that is [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3793.7999999999997s)]
*  central to the world and our identity and our financial lives, it's really bad. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3799.3199999999997s)]
*  And they're still in the email addresses. They're hacking the ATMs. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3804.12s)]
*  Last question. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3810.8399999999997s)]
*  In Democracy in America, Tocqueville called lawyers America's priests of Egypt because [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3812.3599999999997s)]
*  both professions are the only interpreters of an occult science, which I take to mean [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3817.7999999999997s)]
*  that they're both responsible for explaining enough of their systems that people retain their [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3823.24s)]
*  faith in them, but not so much that people lose their faith or they put themselves out of a job. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3828.04s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could put that same mantle on financiers or on financial journalists. And [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3832.4399999999996s)]
*  if you think the sector as a whole has achieved sort of an efficient sweet spot in the extent [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3837.0s)]
*  to which it's understood, its mysteries are understood by the American public. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3841.88s)]
*  Softball question. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3845.88s)]
*  I think that like, sure. Yeah. But like, I think that's true of a lot of sectors, actually. I mean, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3848.68s)]
*  I think we just live in a specialized economy, right? Where like, if you ask like our financiers [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3854.04s)]
*  a priesthood because they explain like just enough to like maintain a mystery, like, yeah, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3859.72s)]
*  but like Facebook way more so, right? Like, I mean, I think that like, we live in a specialized [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3864.68s)]
*  economy and everyone is sort of angling for that notion that what they do is complicated and [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3869.24s)]
*  mysterious and important. And you can sort of get a glimpse of it, but like, I need to maintain the [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3875.48s)]
*  secrets. I do think finance is like, you know, high up in the sweet spot where like, people think [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3880.6s)]
*  it's very complicated and they need to, they need to like defer to a priesthood. But I also think [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3885.0s)]
*  that like, finance has like, come down a bit where now like, people think, ah, it's complicated, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3889.64s)]
*  we need to ban it or ah, it's complicated and we need to need to radically simplify and get [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3894.52s)]
*  rid of leverage rules and you know, like, or like, you know, simplify leverage rules and all these [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3898.44s)]
*  things that are, that are, that suggests that like the general public does not believe the mystique, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3902.52s)]
*  they find it confusing, but not in a not in an awe inspiring way. It's true of lawyers too. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81SgYUkSwoQ&t=3907.7999999999997s)]
