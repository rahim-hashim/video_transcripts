Video Description: Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff approaches global finance with the same strategic foresight that made him a chess grandmaster. Author of the new book Our Dollar, Your Problem, Rogoff doesn’t sugarcoat America’s future: he foresees a significant inflation shock within a decade, far more severe than the post-COVID bout. When this second wave hits, he warns, “credibility’s really going to be shot.”

In this conversation, Ken and Tyler tackle international economic dynamics, unresolved macro puzzles, the state of chess, and more, including whether trade deficits are truly unsustainable, why China’s investment-heavy growth model has reached its limits, how currency depreciation neutralizes tariff effects, Pakistan’s IMF bailouts, whether more Latin American countries should dollarize, Japan’s deceptively peaceful economic decline, Europe’s coming fiscal reckoning, how the US will eventually confront its ballooning debt, the puzzling absence of a recession during our recent disinflation, the potential of phasing out large denomination currency notes, the future relevance of stablecoins, whether America should start a CBDC, Argentina’s chances under Milei, who will be the next dominant player in chess, hanging out with Bobby Fischer, drawing out against Magnus Carlsen, and how to save classical chess from excessive computer preparation.

Recorded April 2nd, 2025.

# Rogoff vs. Magnus. Who was victorious? | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I)
*  Now you must have been out of practice, but I believe you drew Magnus in a game of speed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=0.0s)]
*  chess in 2012? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=4.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really, it really happened. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=5.28s)]
*  How did it happen? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=7.2s)]
*  What's the story? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=8.92s)]
*  He let me have white. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=9.92s)]
*  We played a Ruy Lopez Spanish opening. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  He played the Briar like he used to do? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=14.08s)]
*  He played the Briar. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=15.56s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=16.56s)]
*  He played the Briar. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=17.56s)]
*  I didn't even know that he played it at the time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=18.56s)]
*  I mean, he played a lot of things. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  I didn't know he was playing that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=21.84s)]
*  And you know, so I knew where the pieces go. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=23.72s)]
*  And at one point he, you know, he made an overly aggressive move that just was a big [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=25.56s)]
*  mistake and I saw it and I got a winning advantage. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  It wasn't an easy winning advantage. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=37.56s)]
*  I'm convinced that if he had continued the game, he would have won. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=40.48s)]
*  But at some point he had a choice of repeating moves and he was losing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=44.44s)]
*  You know, he just repeated moves. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=48.16s)]
*  I'm not saying I would have won. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=49.92s)]
*  I think I would have lost if he kept playing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=51.0s)]
*  But it just happened. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=52.92s)]
*  I did it 10,000, 20,000 times more. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=54.68s)]
*  I don't think it would happen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ULwpzx06I&t=57.8s)]
