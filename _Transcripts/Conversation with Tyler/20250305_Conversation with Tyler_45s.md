# Did anti-COVID masking work? Carl Zimmer explains | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ)
*  Did anti-COVID masking work? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, it worked in the sense that there are a number of studies that show that in different [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=2.16s)]
*  situations when masking policies were put in place, along with other measures, you would [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  see a reduction in risk. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  But are they randomized control trials? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=16.64s)]
*  I mean, do we really know? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, there's been a debate about randomized control trials for doing it for something [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=19.84s)]
*  like masks. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=24.96s)]
*  So certainly there are some experts who say like, you can only judge this based on randomized [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=25.96s)]
*  control trials. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  But there are other experts who say, well, that's a bit like saying we need to we need [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=32.56s)]
*  a randomized control trial to show that hard hats work. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=38.4s)]
*  The physics shows you how it works. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT6A9lHmKnQ&t=42.96s)]
