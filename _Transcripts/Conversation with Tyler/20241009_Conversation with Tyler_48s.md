# How knowing classified information changed Tom Tugendhat's worldview  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6yqcsRtTnc)
*  Now when your earlier role as security minister and other posts you've had access to a lot of classified information
*  Of course, we wouldn't ask you to share that with us
*  But could you have us a sense how much has that changed your view of the world?
*  Is it like you learn all those things and then you say oh my god, this is how the world works
*  I never figured that or do you just make marginal adjustments based on what you've learned?
*  I won't tell you any secrets, but I suppose the one secret that I can tell you that some people just won't believe me is
*  conspiracies are
*  Unbelievably difficult and I just don't believe in them anymore. I believe in cock-up
*  I believe there's huge numbers of mistakes that happen and people are constantly misjudging things that I believe in and that leads to
*  very very unpredictable outcomes
*  In in some circumstances, but but I think the conspiracies I'm afraid I don't believe in them
