*  What else might they be aware of that we don't necessarily know about you might know about it, but I don't
*  Well, who's a jerk who's not a jerk? What else?

*  You might think that they do it like adults do on the basis of race
*  Which is very very common and in some way and sooner or later they do that

*  Somebody who speaks English without an accent and somebody speaks English with a faint accent
*  So the importance of language as a sort of marker of group affiliation shows up very early
