Video Description: Though what Taleb was really after was a discussion with Bryan Caplan (which starts at 51:50), the philosopher, mathematician, and author most recently of *Skin in the Game* also generously agreed to a conversation with Tyler.
 
They discuss the ancient Phoenicians and Greco-Roman heritage of Lebanon, philology, genetics, the blockchain, driverless cars, the advantages of Twitter fights, how to think about religion, fancy food vs. Auntie Anne's pretzels, autodidactism, The Desert of the Tartar, why Taleb refused to give a book tour, inverse role models, why math isn't just a young man's game, and more.

# Nassim Nicholas Taleb on Self-Education and Doing the Math (Plus special guest Bryan Caplan) | CWT
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM)
*  Hey everyone, a few announcements before the show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=0.0s)]
*  First, this episode featuring Nassim Nicholas Taleb is immediately followed by a bonus segment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5.8s)]
*  The bonus segment features Taleb and Brian Kaplan talking about Kaplan's latest book, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=11.98s)]
*  The Case Against Education. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=17.6s)]
*  So that will play right after the conversation with Taleb. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=19.68s)]
*  And of course, if you haven't checked out Brian Kaplan's conversation with Tyler, it's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=23.6s)]
*  also right there in your podcast app. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=27.82s)]
*  Second, you Taleb fans will know he wrote a book called Anti-Fragile, which is about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=30.38s)]
*  things that gain from disorder. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=34.94s)]
*  Audio recording systems do not gain from disorder, and ours failed for this live event. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=37.82s)]
*  That means you're going to be hearing a backup audio recording, which unfortunately is of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=43.66s)]
*  lower quality. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=48.24s)]
*  If you're having trouble following along with the audio, I'd encourage you to click [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=49.7s)]
*  in the show notes to the transcript and enjoy the conversation that way. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=53.42s)]
*  Lastly, this episode does contain some explicit language, so if you're listening with kids [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=58.06s)]
*  around, you might want to pop in the earbuds for this one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=62.5s)]
*  We'll be back in two weeks with Tyler's conversation with David Brooks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=65.38s)]
*  It sounds much better, I promise. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=69.34s)]
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=71.7s)]
*  bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=80.18s)]

*  We're very honored today to have with us the great Nassim Nicholas Taleb. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=94.58000000000001s)]
*  I'm reminded of the words of the Hall of Famer Ernie Banks from Chicago. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=102.78s)]
*  We used to always say, let's play two, when there was the possibility of a doubleheader. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=108.38s)]
*  So Nassim Nicholas Taleb has been gracious enough to agree to this dual event, where [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=113.94s)]
*  first he and I will converse, and then he will talk with Brian Kaplan. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=118.66s)]
*  And just to be clear, as always, this is the conversation with Nassim Nicholas Taleb I [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=123.42s)]
*  want to have, not the one that you want to have. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=128.46s)]
*  So, no more puns. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=132.22s)]
*  To start with a very basic question, on page seven of the Black Swan, you mention the 1975 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=135.82s)]
*  Lebanese Civil War as having been a Black Swan of sorts. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=142.22s)]
*  And if we think back to the earlier history of the region, the growing role of the PLO [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=147.14s)]
*  in the country, the end of the Eisenhower Doctrine, which meant maybe the U.S. would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=152.26s)]
*  not intervene, the prior conflict in 1958, ongoing differences in birth rates with more [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=156.34s)]
*  Muslims being born. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=162.3s)]
*  Wasn't it in a sense actually fairly predictable and not a Black Swan? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=163.3s)]
*  How do you see the history of your own country in this way? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=167.26s)]
*  No, it's one that surprises everybody. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=170.26s)]
*  It might have been predictable, but not at that scale for several reasons. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=172.26s)]
*  The first one is that nobody understood the effect of modern weapons, because previous [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=176.46s)]
*  conflicts were more local, and more confined. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=183.66s)]
*  We didn't have artillery, and then things died down quickly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=189.06s)]
*  And then you have another thing, that these idiots brought in the PLO in 1973, in Lebanon, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=194.06s)]
*  as a way that the people of Lebanon wanted to stay neutral with Israel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=201.06s)]
*  Sort of like neutral, but engaged and say, okay, you guys can fight from here, but we're [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=204.06s)]
*  not going to fight Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=208.06s)]
*  And they didn't realize that these guys were the first thing, you know, to do is run a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=210.06s)]
*  takeover of the place. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=216.06s)]
*  So the imbalance came not from within, but came from a huge number of armed Palestinians [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=217.06s)]
*  in Lebanon that disrupted the balance, and caused immediately as a reaction the Christians [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=226.06s)]
*  to go and get on. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=231.06s)]
*  What's the role of the Phoenicians in your thought? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=233.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, the recent circulating that Phoenicians don't exist, and it's not true. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=237.06s)]
*  I think, I mean, physically, they call themselves Phoenician, but canonized, just like the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=244.06s)]
*  Christians exist, but we have some kind of confederation, we have people giving confedrations [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=250.06s)]
*  among them, among the states, the small little unstate, insidious states, within Lebanon. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=255.06s)]
*  And then we know that they, generically, the Phoenicians seem to have come from Anatolia, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=261.06s)]
*  largely, and Anatolia is the same place the Greeks came from. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=270.06s)]
*  So there is a connection that was just discovered a year ago, and maybe in five years from now [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=277.06s)]
*  we'll have a clearer view of the rewriting history based on ancient DNA, but that would [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=285.06s)]
*  understand people. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=291.06s)]
*  Why was it that Phoenicians really sort of had some kind of great working relationship [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=292.06s)]
*  with the Greeks? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=298.06s)]
*  It looks like they were similar, maybe the same, they had the same grandparents in this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=299.06s)]
*  way. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=304.06s)]
*  And also there's some mysterious thing, why is it that the only people who were in Athens [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=305.06s)]
*  were not Medics foreigners? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=310.06s)]
*  The Medic is basically an H1B, you have both. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=313.06s)]
*  So the only one who were not Medics for the Phoenicians was people from Cyprus. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=317.06s)]
*  So there's some kind of, that's why I like to call these people Greek Phoenicians, modern [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=323.06s)]
*  version of the Phoenicians. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=329.06s)]
*  And of course now we know from DNA that the DNA of the past 3700 years hasn't changed [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=331.06s)]
*  much. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=339.06s)]
*  Of the local population to the ancient one. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=340.06s)]
*  I was talking with Eric Weinstein recently, and I suggested the following to him, that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=342.06s)]
*  the way I read your work, on one hand I was trying to explain what happened to Lebanon. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=347.06s)]
*  So it's a very regional concern, but you were also trying to put forward a vision of what [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=352.06s)]
*  an alternative Lebanese history would look like, a Phoenician one. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=358.06s)]
*  And that positive program was the under discussed part of understanding your work. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=363.06s)]
*  You're trying to lay out how Lebanon could be seen or could be a Phoenician culture in [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=368.06s)]
*  the future. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=374.06s)]
*  It is an Isis Mediterranean culture, and I have, it's very easy to convince people it's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=375.06s)]
*  an Isis Mediterranean culture in Lebanon, despite textbooks writing the opposite. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=381.06s)]
*  Everybody will read what happened. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=386.06s)]
*  In 1860, the Christians in Lebanon did not write in Arabic. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=388.06s)]
*  They wrote in Kyrgyz or Gashumi. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=392.06s)]
*  The American University of Beirut came in and tried to recruit Mosul and Denmark, at the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=395.06s)]
*  time called Syrian Protestant College, and they could convert Mosul, so they decided [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=402.06s)]
*  to convert Christians. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=406.06s)]
*  And they translated the first translation of the New Testament, or actually the Bible, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=407.06s)]
*  the whole thing, into Arabic. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=413.06s)]
*  They thought was done by a surgeon, a Boston surgeon called Van Dyck. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=416.06s)]
*  In fact, an attempt had been done 500 years earlier and failed. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=421.06s)]
*  So this Arabization that started in the 1860s in Lebanon, when the Turks were around, is [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=426.06s)]
*  in fact what has, is a distortion of history, of perception, of habits. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=433.06s)]
*  It's trying to bring that part of the world away from the Ottoman Empire, which was a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=438.06s)]
*  Balkan Eastern Mediterranean world in which the place had been, you know, spent 500 years [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=444.06s)]
*  and then before that, 1,000 years on the Greek Romans. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=450.06s)]
*  So trying to move it closer to Arabia. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=454.06s)]
*  And people bought the narrative because the Christians wanted to be non-Muslim, yet had [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=457.06s)]
*  the same rights, so they invented themselves some genetic story that they came from Yemen. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=463.06s)]
*  They came from a tribe called the Melugasan. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=467.06s)]
*  So the Christians invented themselves some kind of story, yeah, the Phoenicians were [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=471.06s)]
*  here, but the Arabs kicked them out, and these are Christians come from a certain [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=475.06s)]
*  genetic focus that the population has a goal and effectively sustain people. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=479.06s)]
*  And I see that you have Charles Corm. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=484.06s)]
*  Charles Corm was the opposite narrative, the Western narrative that we are Greek or Roman. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=486.06s)]
*  We had the school of Beirut, the Greek school of Beirut that for 500 years made or [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=490.06s)]
*  break laws. The only place where laws were made in the Roman Empire. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=495.06s)]
*  We are a Greek-Roman bicultural. Let's go back to the Greek-Roman world. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=499.06s)]
*  It's away from 150 years of Arabization. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=502.06s)]
*  And if you look at Lebanon, you realize that 150 years of Arabizing the peasants had no effect. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=505.06s)]
*  You are a Greek Orthodox by background, and if I were to ask, how did the Maronites fit [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=512.06s)]
*  into your schema? So there is a long-standing tension between these groups. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=518.06s)]
*  It seems to me often that the Greek Orthodox would actually side with the Muslims, wanting [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=522.06s)]
*  a more stable Lebanon, suspicious of the Crusades, suspicious of the Maronites themselves. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=527.06s)]
*  I'm glad you asked me, because I really understood the problem. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=532.06s)]
*  I'd rather have the tiara, the sultans. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=538.06s)]
*  When a lot of people, a lot of factions in Constantinople in the 1400s, the Turks were already [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=543.06s)]
*  in the area surrounding Constantinople for 250 years before it fell. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=549.06s)]
*  And it was just a book country, a four-minute book country. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=555.06s)]
*  It was not. So a lot of the initially the Turks came in as a Byzantine Empire. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=558.06s)]
*  And they were very upset that the Russians would call themselves Caesars. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=565.06s)]
*  What do you mean Caesar? We are, you know, the sultan is the continuation of the Byzantine Empire. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=568.06s)]
*  And there was that tension East-West. And this manifests itself through religion. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=575.06s)]
*  And let me explain what I saw. The coastal Lebanon was monstrously Hellenized, except for Beirut, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=579.06s)]
*  which was Latinized, because the language of Beirut, I mean, people were horrified to see that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=586.06s)]
*  they used Latin, and because it was school of law, but the rest was Greek. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=591.06s)]
*  And the countryside spoke Aramaic. So that's the fact. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=597.06s)]
*  And if you see the religion schisms, they map to Aramaic speakers versus Greek speakers. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=601.06s)]
*  So the Maronites, the Monothelites, as a first schism, that earlier, of course, you had the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=608.06s)]
*  historians as a schism. And you look at the line of how people had the schism in Asia Minor, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=614.06s)]
*  and you see that these schisms were entirely driven by ethnicity, sort of like the English, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=619.06s)]
*  the Protestant versus Irish Catholic. So if the Irish, if the English were Catholic, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=625.06s)]
*  I'd pay you the Irish. So that's sort of like what happened along these lines. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=631.06s)]
*  And of course, the Byzantines were very suspicious of the West, I'm saying, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=639.06s)]
*  and they saw Islam as a... Effectively, it was not really an unrealistic thought, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=645.06s)]
*  because if you look what happened 500 years under the Ottomans, Serbia is Orthodox, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=651.06s)]
*  Albania is Orthodox, Greece is Orthodox, Romania is Orthodox. These parts are Orthodox. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=659.06s)]
*  So the idea, when you look at the world, the division East-West, Christianity, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=667.06s)]
*  it's thought that at the time there were three blocks. There was the French, those Westerners, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=672.06s)]
*  there were the East Meds, the Rums, and then there were the Eastern Arab versions. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=678.06s)]
*  And that was how it was seen. And of course people identified along these lines. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=686.06s)]
*  And then progressively, when you had the heresy, people would go to Rome because they were made by enemy. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=692.06s)]
*  So the Maronites, and Gibbon tells a story beautifully how they came down to Tripoli [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=698.06s)]
*  to deal with the Franks, with the Crusaders to deal with Rome, because they wanted to move away from that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=703.06s)]
*  So the tension is not the tension that is modern, it is a tension, the one between the Maronites [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=712.06s)]
*  and the Greek Orthodox is the tension that has been there forever. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=719.06s)]
*  Let me give you a theory, one more comment, one more comment, since we're talking about it, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=724.06s)]
*  I don't know if you know this, I'm very honored and interested in Saint-Eurese. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=729.06s)]
*  If you look at what happened also, people failed to understand a few things, that you have historians, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=734.06s)]
*  basically the Syriacs, the Orthodox are not Macedonians. If you look at these people, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=742.06s)]
*  the Syriac speakers who absolutely hated the Greeks, just like the Cots hated the Byzantines. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=747.06s)]
*  People forget that before the Arabs conquered the Levant, actually they didn't really conquer the Levant, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=754.06s)]
*  they just went through the Levant, and it's not interesting, out of words, nothing else. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=761.06s)]
*  Before they came by, you had two generations of Persians in Lebanon. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=767.06s)]
*  The Persians came and they brought with them historians, historians are similar to Maronites, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=774.06s)]
*  different heresies, and they brought them with them Zoroastrians. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=779.06s)]
*  And then they left, the Persians were kicked out by the Byzantines. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=783.06s)]
*  Those who stayed were Zoroastrians and historians. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=787.06s)]
*  By some mysterious things, you find Zoroastrianism as a Shiite Islam, born in Lebanon, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=791.06s)]
*  and converting to the Persians, in the same place where these guys were brought in. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=799.06s)]
*  And the Shiites were in Lebanon, so it seems to me that the population of Zoroastrians, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=805.06s)]
*  because the Byzantine hated Zoroastrians and non-Casasomians, and they stayed, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=810.06s)]
*  or at least the religion came in, and there's a high and deep connection between Zoroastrians and Shiites. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=816.06s)]
*  Let me give you a fairly subjective impression I have reading your latest book, Skin in the Game. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=824.06s)]
*  There's this long-standing tension with the Maronites, and you also have a very interesting discussion [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=830.06s)]
*  of why, in terms of Christology, Christ must in some way be at least part of man, for God to have skin in the game. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=836.06s)]
*  And I read that almost as your kind of intellectual reconciliation, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=843.06s)]
*  that the new element for your big vision of what Lebanon could have been and maybe will be, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=847.06s)]
*  that you finally found a way of integrating the Maronites into your basic story, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=853.06s)]
*  that you yourself are willing to accept and indeed embrace. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=857.06s)]
*  Okay, yeah, may I put that, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=860.06s)]
*  So, please, yes. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=862.06s)]
*  Two things about the Maronites. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=864.06s)]
*  The first one is I was convinced until about seven years ago that the Maronites were migrants who came to Lebanon from the East. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=866.06s)]
*  Because effectively their language, their language is not Aramaic, but Syriac, which is Eastern Aramaic. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=877.06s)]
*  And the brand that of course came, but it turned out that in fact it's only the religion. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=885.06s)]
*  Their DNA is as local as it can be. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=890.06s)]
*  The Maronites are the descendants of the Phoenicians, so are the Shiites of Lebanon. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=892.06s)]
*  We Greek Orthodox and the Sunnis have a little more Greek or stuff like that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=897.06s)]
*  So that seemed to me, when I realized that, that I realized that they were not optimists. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=903.06s)]
*  So it was already something. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=907.06s)]
*  So, second point, let's talk about skin in the game. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=910.06s)]
*  As I was watching to connect to this, as I was watching Donald Trump debate the other, the guy who wears suits. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=914.06s)]
*  I knew he was going to win. I was certain he was going to win. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=923.06s)]
*  I couldn't figure out why. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=927.06s)]
*  I was so convinced he was going to win, at least at stage of the primary. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=929.06s)]
*  And it turned out, I figured out, I said yes. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=933.06s)]
*  People love, and it turned out that I had heard the day before, the news that were effectively not that correct, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=937.06s)]
*  that he lost more than a billion dollars on money. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=944.06s)]
*  I thought about it, I said, okay, is there anything more human that shown a scar? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=946.06s)]
*  You know, at least not real, that you guys are just like pencil pushers or whatever. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=953.06s)]
*  So I thought about it, I said that the skin in the game, you know, is really risk-taking, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=958.06s)]
*  is effectively what makes you, elevates you over the redheads, traditionally, you exhibit a scar. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=963.06s)]
*  Or like they have some kind of scar or some kind of sign of incapacitation coming from war. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=970.06s)]
*  So effectively, it didn't hurt Armand. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=977.06s)]
*  I was a practitioner coming from trading, the trader who lost a lot of money, at least in the real. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=980.06s)]
*  It's not like a bad thing. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=985.06s)]
*  So I realized immediately that, and then I thought about it, I had trouble figuring out why is it that the Christian religion, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=987.06s)]
*  we have that Trinity, which makes absolutely no sense to Muslims. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=997.06s)]
*  That makes no sense to anybody who's not Christian. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1001.06s)]
*  But it makes so much sense to you if you're Christian. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1003.06s)]
*  So why is it that it makes so much sense to have a Trinity? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1006.06s)]
*  And then the Christ, is he God? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1009.06s)]
*  Well, it's sort of like God, but he's not God. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1012.06s)]
*  So you want to figure it out. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1015.06s)]
*  Then you figure it out. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1016.06s)]
*  If I go to the circus and I have a fellow walking on a tightrope with a parachute, I ask for my money back. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1017.06s)]
*  See, that's how it works. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1025.06s)]
*  So the Christ was sufficiently meant to have skin and a game, and sufficiently God to be God. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1028.06s)]
*  So it worked. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1037.06s)]
*  And for that, we had to concoct a story that appears to be absurd, but is necessary, because coming back to the Trinity, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1038.06s)]
*  no matter what they tried, let me try comparing you to another best-selling Lebanese author. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1045.06s)]
*  Are you the anti-Calino Gibran? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1050.06s)]
*  You both have books of sayings. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1054.06s)]
*  You're both, in a sense, offering sermons from exile. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1056.06s)]
*  Both moved to America. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1059.06s)]
*  But he was Maronite. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1061.06s)]
*  His influences are maybe Baha'i and the Sufis. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1062.06s)]
*  And you're, in a sense, doing everything in reverse and rebelling against him. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1065.06s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1069.06s)]
*  Well, not quite, because when you grow up in Lebanon, you don't have a lot of... [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1070.06s)]
*  I mean, you think that Gibran is kind of no-wage stuff for the Marthas. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1076.06s)]
*  The idea of Gibran is not a serious... [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1081.06s)]
*  Plus, the other thing is he comes from an area right above my village, like 30 miles away, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1085.06s)]
*  you know, it's 20, 30 kilometers away. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1090.06s)]
*  And they invaded us two or three times. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1093.06s)]
*  So, charity versus immune of my village. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1098.06s)]
*  The Byzantine, last Byzantine outpost, and they'll come and invade us. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1101.06s)]
*  So, maybe you want to do some psychology on that. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1105.06s)]
*  But Gibran has never been in high standing in my... [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1110.06s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people are in high standing from the area, but not Gibran. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1114.06s)]
*  Let me try to question a reader in email to me, and I quote, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1118.06s)]
*  What advice would you give to the timid and unconfident? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1121.06s)]
*  Does one seeking conventional employability and respect, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1124.06s)]
*  out of lack of imagination or lack of confidence, deserve only contempt? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1127.06s)]
*  How does one be in the world meaningfully if you're not awesome? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1132.06s)]
*  Okay, so it's the exact opposite. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1137.06s)]
*  The point is that we are imperfect, and the way you can function best is accepting we're imperfect. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1140.06s)]
*  This is why we have theology, we want perfection, we can find it, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1144.06s)]
*  and theosis, we can find a lot of things. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1147.06s)]
*  Incidentally, to go back to the idea of being orthodox, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1149.06s)]
*  theosis is a way for us humans to rise above our condition of human, right? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1152.06s)]
*  And it's good for its openness, it's equal opportunity here, but for everyone. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1158.06s)]
*  So, if you consider that we are imperfect, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1162.06s)]
*  and the way really you can rise is through honor, sense of honor, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1165.06s)]
*  by doing your reason for self-sacrifice, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1170.06s)]
*  then you're a lot less going to gain, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1173.06s)]
*  taking risks for the sake of becoming more human. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1175.06s)]
*  Let's say that there's a slight of practice, you took risks and you suffered, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1181.06s)]
*  of course it was a bad outcome, but you don't have to go that far. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1184.06s)]
*  So that was the idea. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1188.06s)]
*  And I didn't talk about theosis, I just mentioned one footnote, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1190.06s)]
*  but it's sort of like you understand that the way that we're not in here [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1196.06s)]
*  to eat mozzarella and good pustin, right? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1200.06s)]
*  And we're not in here to kill a lady, but we're in here to mostly to sacrifice, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1203.06s)]
*  to do something, right? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1208.06s)]
*  And the way you do it, by taking risks. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1210.06s)]
*  Some people take risks, and some people labor in the fields. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1213.06s)]
*  But you have the option of doing either one or the other. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1217.06s)]
*  But my point is you should never have someone rise in society [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1221.06s)]
*  if he or she is not taking risks for the sake of others. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1224.06s)]
*  That's one rule. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1229.06s)]
*  And the second one, you should never be public intellectual [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1230.06s)]
*  if any statement you make doesn't entail risk taking, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1233.06s)]
*  which is a fact. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1237.06s)]
*  It comes with, in other words, you should never have rewards without any risk. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1238.06s)]
*  That's the same. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1245.06s)]
*  And then you can accept inequality if the person who's unequal is taking risks, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1246.06s)]
*  because that would make things rotate. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1252.06s)]
*  For example, if someone becomes a billionaire, it's fine, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1255.06s)]
*  he's unequal, but he got to keep taking risks. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1259.06s)]
*  You cannot be locked into a frozen upper class condition [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1262.06s)]
*  and then use your situation to use the government to prop you up there. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1267.06s)]
*  And that's the good thing about America, it's the rotation that you have. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1271.06s)]
*  When it comes to childbearing decisions, do men have enough skin in the game? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1274.06s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't know if we can divide things so narrowly, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1279.06s)]
*  because men have lower life expectancy, so visibly, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1284.06s)]
*  and have had in history lower life expectancy. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1288.06s)]
*  I don't know that today in Washington, D.C. it's not reversed, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1292.06s)]
*  but today, and of course, you have more criminals than one man, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1295.06s)]
*  but one ratio is 10 to 1. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1299.06s)]
*  And you have incarceration, so you have a high rate. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1301.06s)]
*  So maybe not in the bearing of a child, but in doing something else that's dangerous. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1304.06s)]
*  Let me ask you another question about religion. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1309.06s)]
*  Is volatility and floating exchange rates a big problem? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1312.06s)]
*  Volatility and floating exchange rates. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1316.06s)]
*  So when it comes to religion, again, I wrote in here, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1319.06s)]
*  we don't know what the F star star we're talking about, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1324.06s)]
*  we're talking about religion, because people start comparing religion, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1327.06s)]
*  the thing is ill-defined. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1331.06s)]
*  There are some religions that are religions. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1333.06s)]
*  Some religions are just bodies of law, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1335.06s)]
*  like Judaism and Islam are not religions like Christianity is a religion. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1337.06s)]
*  The exact opposite. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1341.06s)]
*  And let me explain. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1342.06s)]
*  The foundation of Judaism was law, right? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1344.06s)]
*  But it was municipal. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1348.06s)]
*  It was for the tribe. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1350.06s)]
*  It was law, Yerushan, Mount Suwan, this, okay. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1352.06s)]
*  And then Islam, the same word, deen, in Arabic means law in Hebrew, okay. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1355.06s)]
*  But not in Syria, which is a Semitic language used by Christians, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1362.06s)]
*  which, okay, where they use two different words, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1365.06s)]
*  one nomus, law, and one deen for religion. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1367.06s)]
*  So why is it so? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1372.06s)]
*  Because Islam and Judaism are laws. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1373.06s)]
*  It's law. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1376.06s)]
*  There's no distinction between holy and profane. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1377.06s)]
*  Whereas Christianity is not law. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1381.06s)]
*  Why isn't law? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1383.06s)]
*  Simple reason. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1384.06s)]
*  You remember the Christ said, well, this is Caesar, this is not Caesar, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1385.06s)]
*  because the Romans had the law. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1389.06s)]
*  So you're not going to bring the law, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1392.06s)]
*  because they already have the law and very sophisticated law in that. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1394.06s)]
*  The Romans. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1397.06s)]
*  So Christianity was, with Christianity, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1398.06s)]
*  was born the separation of church and state. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1401.06s)]
*  It's a secular, so effectively, a secular religion in the sense that [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1404.06s)]
*  when you go home, you do whatever you want. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1408.06s)]
*  So of course, Christianity had its hiccups, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1410.06s)]
*  we had theocracies, a few, and it was all cosmetic. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1412.06s)]
*  Like, for example, when you have the codes, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1415.06s)]
*  whether theodosis, Justinian, take Justinian's code, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1418.06s)]
*  you look at it, you see just cosmetically, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1422.06s)]
*  say we bless it by the grace of God, two pages, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1424.06s)]
*  but the rest is intact, the Roman law. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1428.06s)]
*  So when we talk about religion, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1431.06s)]
*  so when people are talking about Salafi Islam, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1434.06s)]
*  it's not a religion in the sense that Mormon Christianity is a religion. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1437.06s)]
*  It is a body of law. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1441.06s)]
*  It's a legal system, it's a political system, it's a legal system. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1443.06s)]
*  So people are very confused when they talk about religion. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1446.06s)]
*  The comparing thing, they're not saying. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1450.06s)]
*  And effectively, when I say that I'm Christian, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1453.06s)]
*  I'm very different from saying I am something else. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1456.06s)]
*  And the thing we say, sometimes it describes ethnicity, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1459.06s)]
*  the Greek Orthodox are more ethnicity than something else. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1463.06s)]
*  Or being Serbian versus Croatian. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1466.06s)]
*  Sometimes religion becomes an identity, sometimes law, sometimes very universal. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1473.06s)]
*  And sometimes the hidden thing, you have pagan tendencies, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1479.06s)]
*  hidden under some kind of taqiyah, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1486.06s)]
*  that you see in minorities, in mystic religions, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1489.06s)]
*  like Alawites, the Druze, other... [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1491.06s)]
*  So comparing religions naively, silly, it's verbalistic, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1496.06s)]
*  and leads to things like saying, well, he has a right to exercise his faith. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1501.06s)]
*  Some faiths should not have the rights to be exercised like Salafis or extreme Shiawis, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1505.06s)]
*  because they're not a religion, they're a legal system. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1511.06s)]
*  They're like political party that wants to ban all other political parties. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1514.06s)]
*  If you go with that, you're repeating the circumstance. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1518.06s)]
*  How is the Aramaic language influenced or how to structure your thought? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1522.06s)]
*  I mean, zero. I mean, I'll pick it up later. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1526.06s)]
*  But it's always interesting to discover some theology. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1530.06s)]
*  And I discovered two or three things that are not scared of the game. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1534.06s)]
*  I discovered there are two kinds of people, and hopefully we'll talk about it again with Brian, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1539.06s)]
*  people who come from practice and people who come from theory. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1543.06s)]
*  And we have... this planet doesn't have a third category of people who have both. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1548.06s)]
*  So you have linguists who absolutely don't know the fact... [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1555.06s)]
*  Sorry, what the hell they're talking about. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1558.06s)]
*  They're not religion. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1560.06s)]
*  And so I noticed that in the description of categorization of languages, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1562.06s)]
*  linguists are not fluent in the language, they're categorizing. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1567.06s)]
*  And it makes a huge difference. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1570.06s)]
*  So I think the London team is close to Aramaic. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1572.06s)]
*  But linguists don't accept it because they have their metrics that don't work. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1576.06s)]
*  But if you use a statistical method, then you realize that it's Aramaic. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1581.06s)]
*  Or if you use practice, you realize that. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1585.06s)]
*  I'd like to toss out the names of just a few countries or regions, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1588.06s)]
*  and you tell me whether or not you think they're anti-fragile. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1591.06s)]
*  Singapore. Singapore has science going for it. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1594.06s)]
*  So you're defining... you're talking about a city. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1598.06s)]
*  A city-state. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1602.06s)]
*  Isn't it a vulnerable city-state that relies on our protection, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1604.06s)]
*  and we don't always care? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1607.06s)]
*  One thing I've learned from history, particularly the Phoenicians, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1609.06s)]
*  the Phoenicians, they really have an army. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1614.06s)]
*  At some point they had an army that you wouldn't say is economically viable. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1616.06s)]
*  Why? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1620.06s)]
*  When you come to invade them, unless you're a Democrat, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1621.06s)]
*  and the phalanx is very nasty, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1624.06s)]
*  the fact-checking that takes place, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1627.06s)]
*  and the genetics actually don't show, but really, it may have happened. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1630.06s)]
*  And the guy comes in, very bloodthirsty, comes to you, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1635.06s)]
*  and you tell him, listen, what do you want? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1639.06s)]
*  You kill us all, you get nothing. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1641.06s)]
*  Then it's not interesting. What are you going to get? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1644.06s)]
*  We'll give you 5%, all right? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1647.06s)]
*  So what do you want? 5% of something or 100% of nothing? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1650.06s)]
*  So that's how the Phoenicians operated. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1653.06s)]
*  So someone would come in, I mean, they had a hiccup with Alexander, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1656.06s)]
*  one town, five, had a hiccup with Alexander, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1659.06s)]
*  but they had a hiccup problem on both sides. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1662.06s)]
*  But other than that, we haven't had... [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1666.06s)]
*  So it worked very well as a system, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1668.06s)]
*  the solution is to conquer the Phoenicians, right? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1670.06s)]
*  The Phoenicians, the Phoenicians, the Phoenicians came in, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1673.06s)]
*  they say, okay, the system at the time was patronage. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1675.06s)]
*  You come in, you're a facile state, and then you say, what is it? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1678.06s)]
*  So, and then you guys are the Victorian, you understand. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1682.06s)]
*  I live in the Earth State, so I have two options. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1686.06s)]
*  One, pay the state, all of this stuff is going to go 50-some percent, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1689.06s)]
*  the taxes, and you almost get nothing. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1692.06s)]
*  Or you go to the mafia and all you get is 2%. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1695.06s)]
*  And you get protection, you get all the things that you want done. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1698.06s)]
*  2%, right? So that's exactly what happened. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1702.06s)]
*  So think about the defense budget if it were run by the mafia, all right? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1705.06s)]
*  The guy who would come in, so the system at the time was the system, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1709.06s)]
*  when you say conquer, the imperial methods everywhere, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1714.06s)]
*  including the Ottomans, before them the Romans, before them the Seleucides, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1718.06s)]
*  and the Ottomans who had more integration. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1722.06s)]
*  But the whole technique was, is very, you come in, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1726.06s)]
*  and remember that government role, the GDP, was at the turn of the century, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1729.06s)]
*  in France, 5%. Okay, less century. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1734.06s)]
*  So having been, you're not part of anything, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1737.06s)]
*  you're just paying taxes to someone you've never seen. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1740.06s)]
*  That was the thing. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1743.06s)]
*  The integration usually was through commerce, not through military commerce. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1745.06s)]
*  And so the idea of Singapore, someone, let's say Malaysia, decides to go to Singapore, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1750.06s)]
*  what are they going to do with it? They've got nothing. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1756.06s)]
*  So it's much better to go to Singapore, Taiwan, we want 2%. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1758.06s)]
*  All right, only want 10%, and then it would break it down to 3%. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1763.06s)]
*  Who did the pressure, fragile or anti-fragile? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1767.06s)]
*  I did something, I did a study on countries, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1770.06s)]
*  when we wanted to look at the recent metrics in the style [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1774.06s)]
*  of predicting stability of countries based on past stability, all right? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1779.06s)]
*  Which to me is absurd. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1785.06s)]
*  For example, if you take, because that metric would tell you [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1787.06s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia, well, the residents liked one actually, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1792.06s)]
*  I came here and told them, I took a set of countries, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1796.06s)]
*  same government for 40 years, 40 government in 40 years, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1799.06s)]
*  which country is more stable? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1803.06s)]
*  Two sets of countries on the right, one on the left. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1805.06s)]
*  They said the one that had the same government, same values actually, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1808.06s)]
*  people here in this town, at the Woodson Center. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1811.06s)]
*  So I said that these guys are cutting things backwards. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1814.06s)]
*  The countries on the right were Syria and Saudi Arabia, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1818.06s)]
*  now it's so far away for a second shoot drop. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1822.06s)]
*  And the other one was Italy, and last time I checked, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1825.06s)]
*  Italy was still standing, and Mozzarella was excellent. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1828.06s)]
*  So the idea of countries that are, have a very, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1832.06s)]
*  too much stability become weaker, particularly if it's propped up, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1838.06s)]
*  sort of like companies, if you take companies, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1842.06s)]
*  you want to see companies that are robust, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1844.06s)]
*  look at companies that have zero volatility, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1846.06s)]
*  repressed volatility, many of them really should have [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1848.06s)]
*  zero volatility, but some of them would have a, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1851.06s)]
*  would be sitting on dynamite. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1854.06s)]
*  You're smoothing to cover things up, right? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1856.06s)]
*  Or if you have, for example, someone who has employed, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1858.06s)]
*  who has a very stable salary because she is employed [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1861.06s)]
*  as an antifatual by day, but then you're laid off [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1864.06s)]
*  for the next 65, 30 years of employment, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1867.06s)]
*  and basically you can't do anything, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1870.06s)]
*  whereas someone who has a little volatile income is more adaptive. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1872.06s)]
*  So when I looked at countries, we looked at countries [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1875.06s)]
*  in the Eastern Bloc, and these countries had effectively [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1879.06s)]
*  the two properties, one, they took a lot of it [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1885.06s)]
*  during that period, you know, the post-Soviet phase [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1888.06s)]
*  was very, very, very, very rough. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1892.06s)]
*  And all of them, Armenia, Georgia, Russia, Romania, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1895.06s)]
*  all of them, in fact, groups were left, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1901.06s)]
*  so countries, I mean, so this makes me believe [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1905.06s)]
*  that they can take another economic crisis, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1909.06s)]
*  any crisis, and survive, they have proof, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1911.06s)]
*  the ability to survive. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1914.06s)]
*  I'm not sure France can manage tomorrow, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1915.06s)]
*  they had the same instruction. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1918.06s)]
*  Younger homes, Turkey, fragile or antifragile? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1920.06s)]
*  I'm going to Turkey in two weeks, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1923.06s)]
*  so if your other answer want to come back, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1925.06s)]
*  but, okay, that's something, but from my feeling [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1927.06s)]
*  that what you see on, the Turks are very happy [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1934.06s)]
*  because they got washing machines, they got stuff, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1938.06s)]
*  and they attributed to Erdogan, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1941.06s)]
*  so Erdogan is associated with growth, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1943.06s)]
*  not so much with religion. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1947.06s)]
*  PLO, fragile or antifragile? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1949.06s)]
*  PLO. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1952.06s)]
*  Addis Pou, liberation, okay. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1953.06s)]
*  I mean, yeah, they were antifragile, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1955.06s)]
*  they had nothing to lose, but they were in Lebanon, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1957.06s)]
*  they had nothing to lose, so this is why [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1959.06s)]
*  they had no skin in the game. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1960.06s)]
*  That's sort of the idea of a group that had nothing to lose, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1961.06s)]
*  always, I mean, had nothing to lose, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1964.06s)]
*  so they engaged in civil war. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1967.06s)]
*  In Lebanon today, every time someone sneezes [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1969.06s)]
*  in downtown Beirut, people are afraid [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1972.06s)]
*  of civil war, okay, and they don't realize [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1974.06s)]
*  that everyone is down up to here in the real estate. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1977.06s)]
*  So nobody has any interest in the New Age War. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1980.06s)]
*  It's not like 1975 or 1973. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1983.06s)]
*  What's it like housing six Syrian refugees? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1986.06s)]
*  They're very nice, they're Sunnis, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1989.06s)]
*  and my mother hates Assad, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1991.06s)]
*  and they love Assad, and there's fights between my mother [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1994.06s)]
*  and the Sunnis, because they call him Assad, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1997.06s)]
*  and one of them went to Syria to vote for Assad [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=1999.06s)]
*  and could come back, just to tell you how demolished he is. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2003.06s)]
*  So I picked, so what I do is I talk to him [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2006.06s)]
*  to know what's going on, because he calls his brothers, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2008.06s)]
*  siblings, and he violently, his Sunni, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2011.06s)]
*  violently said something, why? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2015.06s)]
*  He said that he religious, Sunni. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2017.06s)]
*  He said because, at least you get it, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2019.06s)]
*  so for him, Assad represents stability, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2022.06s)]
*  and effectively for a lot of Syrians, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2024.06s)]
*  so if you look at Syria from Syria, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2026.06s)]
*  not Syria from Saudi Barbarian finance lobbies here, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2028.06s)]
*  you get a different story. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2032.06s)]
*  People want stability, but one lesson I learned from Syria, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2034.06s)]
*  that he's complaining, he said, you know, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2038.06s)]
*  I go here in Lebanon, this guy sells it for $200, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2040.06s)]
*  this guy $220, $240, he says Syria's perfect, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2044.06s)]
*  same price everywhere. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2047.06s)]
*  So the bass has indoctrinated people [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2049.06s)]
*  to the point that maybe no return, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2054.06s)]
*  but I mean, people understand that Assad is not a god, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2057.06s)]
*  but I bet you a lot of Iraqis would like [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2065.06s)]
*  to see the Sun come back after what they saw. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2067.06s)]
*  So the idea that they all have a garden of the same analysis, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2070.06s)]
*  if you're on the ground, you don't have this theoretical thing, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2075.06s)]
*  this guy's an asshole, okay, fine, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2078.06s)]
*  you've got to realize what existence is, right? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2080.06s)]
*  You've got to look at both sides of the systems, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2082.06s)]
*  that when you have silverware, you have proof, you find it, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2084.06s)]
*  so you take the least asshole becomes [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2086.06s)]
*  somewhat good in your eyes, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2089.06s)]
*  but when you analyze only one portion, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2091.06s)]
*  the idea, I mean, Assad blew up, his father blew up my house, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2094.06s)]
*  my grandfather was a member of parliament, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2100.06s)]
*  1982, about a quarter for the pro-Israeli, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2102.06s)]
*  and they came in and blew up our house, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2105.06s)]
*  so I have hatred for the Assad family, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2108.06s)]
*  but at the same time, I just realized I have a bigger hatred [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2110.06s)]
*  for the jihadis and for the clients of Obama, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2114.06s)]
*  so this is how you got to analyze it, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2119.06s)]
*  I mean, not preferentially, not naively, but more [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2121.06s)]
*  I have a series of quick questions to ask you about the topic of wisdom, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2123.06s)]
*  I'll just chip these out, feel free to pass if you don't want to address them. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2128.06s)]
*  First, what is the biggest mistake people make when they go to the gym? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2132.06s)]
*  Is they exercise too much. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2136.06s)]
*  What's the best way to find and consume dark chocolate? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2139.06s)]
*  I think that's one thing, that this is ten years behind, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2143.06s)]
*  somehow I lost the taste for chocolate, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2148.06s)]
*  but the best way to find and consume is not those labels, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2150.06s)]
*  you know, the fancy thing made by the farmers, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2153.06s)]
*  probably made in Brooklyn, but I'm sorry, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2156.06s)]
*  if you were here today, what would you ask of Erdogan? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2162.06s)]
*  What would you think of Trump? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2167.06s)]
*  What can we learn from Sufism? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2169.06s)]
*  Well, to have a branch of Islam that is effectively peaceful, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2171.06s)]
*  allows drinking, I don't know if you know that, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2178.06s)]
*  so that's very convenient, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2181.06s)]
*  but the problem that it was destroyed by Saudi-Iranian funding, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2185.06s)]
*  that's how to provide, should provide Sufism, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2192.06s)]
*  and what can we learn from them is how the religion can be destroyed by anybody in order to do it. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2194.06s)]
*  The number of Sufis, Ottoman Sufis, take the people in Lebanon, it was Sufi. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2199.06s)]
*  Why did it become not Sufi? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2205.06s)]
*  Because it's funded from Saudi Arabia, you indoctrinate the two generations, that's it. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2208.06s)]
*  How do you find the right mentors in life? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2213.06s)]
*  I don't know, but I know how to find the best mentors. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2216.06s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2219.06s)]
*  People, you know they do something wrong, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2221.06s)]
*  and you figure out what may do something wrong. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2225.06s)]
*  Like there's a fellow I worked with, and I knew that he was a complete failure, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2228.06s)]
*  but the last person, so I wanted to do something wrong. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2233.06s)]
*  He was always caught into details. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2236.06s)]
*  So I realized that details, you've got only one sense of detail, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2239.06s)]
*  you cannot get into more than one set of details. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2243.06s)]
*  So that's one thing I learned. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2246.06s)]
*  And also that by inverse role models, people don't want to be like, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2248.06s)]
*  So you pick someone, you're with them. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2253.06s)]
*  You have instinct to know what they're going to do. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2257.06s)]
*  Look at what they've done, what they do, and then you do a reverse rotation. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2260.06s)]
*  And it works. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2265.06s)]
*  What's the best thing to do on an airplane? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2266.06s)]
*  Twitter fight. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2268.06s)]
*  The problem is nobody fights with me anymore. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2272.06s)]
*  I try to fight with a fellow. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2276.06s)]
*  The problem again is that the pseudo-expert, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2281.06s)]
*  that micro-economist, my worst micro-economist, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2288.06s)]
*  because you can macro bullshit more easily than micro bullshit. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2293.06s)]
*  So nobody catches me, there's no feedback. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2297.06s)]
*  So I try to get into fights with micro people, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2300.06s)]
*  and I try to get into fights with fellow, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2305.06s)]
*  I was repeating that story that we're refusing expertise at all. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2307.06s)]
*  Like people on the internet, cartoon, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2313.06s)]
*  and New Yorker that shows people who decide that they don't need the expertise of the pilot. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2317.06s)]
*  You cannot compare macro-economist to a pilot. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2322.06s)]
*  So there are two classes of experts. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2325.06s)]
*  There's many masters, our experts at belly dancing, war, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2327.06s)]
*  the people who steal radios from cars, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2332.06s)]
*  our experts are stealing radios from cars, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2335.06s)]
*  the dentists, our experts at dentistry. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2337.06s)]
*  But I'm not sure micro-economists know anything about anything. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2339.06s)]
*  So you can't because there's no feedback. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2342.06s)]
*  So we don't know. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2345.06s)]
*  Maybe they know more policy makers, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2346.06s)]
*  or people in the State Department. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2348.06s)]
*  I'm not sure they know anything, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2350.06s)]
*  because there's no feedback. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2352.06s)]
*  So we definitely know that a carpenter is an expert at carpenter. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2354.06s)]
*  So I try to have a Twitter fight with a fellow, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2360.06s)]
*  because usually Twitter fights are number one makes you look forward [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2364.06s)]
*  to opening your computer, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2367.06s)]
*  and it kills time like nothing. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2371.06s)]
*  They don't engage me anymore. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2374.06s)]
*  So we put our trust in cryptocurrencies. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2377.06s)]
*  I have no idea, but one thing for sure that's working with cryptocurrencies [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2380.06s)]
*  is that it's forcing those folks here in Federal Reserve, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2385.06s)]
*  to understand that they don't have a monopoly over our lives. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2390.06s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2393.06s)]
*  And they aren't scared of it. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2395.06s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2398.06s)]
*  Sorry if I use the Latin. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2400.06s)]
*  How does the blockchain worry you? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2402.06s)]
*  Once it's written, you cannot rewrite it or repeal to an external authority. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2405.06s)]
*  I mean, that's that. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2409.06s)]
*  Or if enough miners in northern China somewhere decided to pollute and hit 51 percent. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2410.06s)]
*  It seems in some ways a quite non robust system, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2416.06s)]
*  maybe under small probabilities. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2419.06s)]
*  Okay, the systems get robust typically. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2421.06s)]
*  We have had that equivalent of blockchain with a level of credit. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2424.06s)]
*  And we're practicing that credit at two levels. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2429.06s)]
*  The first one, the recent one since commerce in 500 years. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2432.06s)]
*  And of course, over time, you find that you've developed. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2437.06s)]
*  That's so long, you don't have a lot of transaction on one single poll. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2440.06s)]
*  And then you figure out if it doesn't work, someone will bring something with the counter. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2445.06s)]
*  You know, a trick that will have other flaws. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2451.06s)]
*  So we'll prepare it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2455.06s)]
*  But if you take earlier, the blockchain will resemble the Phoenician model of trading. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2457.06s)]
*  Phoenician model of trading. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2462.06s)]
*  I'll call your mother if you don't believe the person that's. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2464.06s)]
*  So the whole idea, the concept of a currency that's triggered. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2467.06s)]
*  In other words, you have now means of payment that are triggered by receipt of merchandise [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2476.06s)]
*  or coupled with receipt of merchandise is a brilliant idea. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2481.06s)]
*  So this is why, I mean, at some point we will discover the flaws of blockchain. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2484.06s)]
*  There are plenty of flaws, of course, but we don't know if they're vulnerable. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2490.06s)]
*  Self-driving cars, are they fragile or anti-fragile? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2493.06s)]
*  I have a self-driving car. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2496.06s)]
*  I mean, semi-self-driving, that's what I think. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2498.06s)]
*  I drive it. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2500.06s)]
*  The problem is locally, it drives so long that we don't know how self-driving car it is [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2502.06s)]
*  or other self-driving cars. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2507.06s)]
*  You know, the sum, it's like flocks of birds that behave differently from the sum of birds. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2509.06s)]
*  Like markets behave differently from individuals. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2515.06s)]
*  So when you have a flocks of drones, typically it's one computer running all these drones. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2518.06s)]
*  If one computer ran all these self-driving cars, that may work, but then, you know, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2524.06s)]
*  someone would take over the world. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2529.06s)]
*  That way, you know, you have this and you own the world. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2532.06s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2534.06s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2536.06s)]
*  I think it's a great idea to have self-driving cars. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2537.06s)]
*  If someone in a car is responsible, there's an accident. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2540.06s)]
*  So in other words, someone is, either someone I can sue or someone I can, you know, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2544.06s)]
*  blame, there's something great, who is in the vehicle, not sitting on some computer, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2549.06s)]
*  not some anonymous person. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2553.06s)]
*  And should we someday just all collectively turn our back on social media? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2555.06s)]
*  No, because social media is liddy. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2559.06s)]
*  And that means that there are things that are robust at times, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2561.06s)]
*  like some basins that are robust at times, and you realize that, for example, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2566.06s)]
*  this cup of coffee, you know, the, I'm not going to go back to Finnish or something. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2570.06s)]
*  You can, you can. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2575.06s)]
*  Okay, the book is 500 years old under this form and maybe several thousand years old [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2577.06s)]
*  under a different form. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2582.06s)]
*  So the liddly means that they're robust at times and they come back after they disappear [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2584.06s)]
*  and they have to come back. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2590.06s)]
*  Now, it so happened that at no point in history, except during the post, you know, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2592.06s)]
*  the war period, that people received news without being conveyed as news, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2599.06s)]
*  without, you know, that nuclear family of people, mom, 2.2 kids, one dog, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2604.06s)]
*  and washing TV, all right, receiving information and not transmitting, all right, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2610.06s)]
*  the solitude of big city blocks. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2615.06s)]
*  So that was the idea. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2617.06s)]
*  Well, that's gone because traditionally you get the news and you convey the news. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2619.06s)]
*  So you're a recipient and a conveyor with a little bit of alteration in the process. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2625.06s)]
*  So, and then we get back to the social media. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2631.06s)]
*  So I, and you very quickly learn to identify, like there was a false alert yesterday in [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2634.06s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, and there was a coup or something, but you can figure out that there are some [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2639.06s)]
*  people you can trust, others you can't trust. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2646.06s)]
*  And those you can't trust, you quickly identify them. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2649.06s)]
*  Like those who cry wolf all the time. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2651.06s)]
*  And so social media has been going back to a naturalistic environment because, say, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2654.06s)]
*  in Athens, where was the news, what was the newsroom? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2660.06s)]
*  The newsroom was a barber shop. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2665.06s)]
*  You go in, you get information and you take information. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2667.06s)]
*  Or the fish market, you go in, you get fish, you get information, you get information. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2671.06s)]
*  And funerals, where you go in and you chat, you know, think like you cry and then you [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2675.06s)]
*  get all the gossip. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2679.06s)]
*  So that is with gossip machines. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2681.06s)]
*  So it is, so social media is great in that respect. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2683.06s)]
*  And I love it because I didn't, I don't know if you, I told, I did, I refused to have a [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2688.06s)]
*  book tour. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2693.06s)]
*  I refused to give media interviews, in the US at least. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2695.06s)]
*  I did one in London by accident. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2698.06s)]
*  I refused to send my book to newspapers. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2701.06s)]
*  So random I said, what? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2703.06s)]
*  I said, okay, find other authors. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2704.06s)]
*  So okay, they agreed, although they cheated I think, by sending some people books. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2707.06s)]
*  So there was no book review in the US, my book. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2713.06s)]
*  All social media. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2716.06s)]
*  And it opened number 12, a cell list. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2717.06s)]
*  It tells you that you don't need the New York Times to exist as an author. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2720.06s)]
*  Twitter is sufficient. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2725.06s)]
*  Twitter and Facebook. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2726.06s)]
*  For our final segment, I have a few questions on what I call the Nassim Nicholas Tala production [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2729.06s)]
*  function. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2734.06s)]
*  So you've written a few times that you've described yourself as an ascetic in some ways. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2735.06s)]
*  How did you become an ascetic early in your life? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2740.06s)]
*  Ascetic? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2744.06s)]
*  Ascetic, you mean like up the mountain? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2745.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2749.06s)]
*  So I'm not that ascetic. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2750.06s)]
*  It depends on what you're ascetic about. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2752.06s)]
*  And I discovered, okay, so let me give you an anecdote that's in the book. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2755.06s)]
*  One day I went with someone for dinner. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2759.06s)]
*  And I wanted to go to a tabernacle. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2763.06s)]
*  And no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2767.06s)]
*  You've got to go to a better restaurant. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2769.06s)]
*  So I ended up having a meal, which like you realize, the meal at the three-star Michelin [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2771.06s)]
*  restaurant. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2779.06s)]
*  We sit down, we have the funny people, this microscopic work. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2780.06s)]
*  It's like going to work, all right? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2785.06s)]
*  You're not concentrated, you're really biting too much. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2787.06s)]
*  And you get all these sophistications from Nassim. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2790.06s)]
*  Then I realized that as people get rich, they get controlled by the preferences, they get [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2792.06s)]
*  controlled by the outside. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2798.06s)]
*  And it was like $200 a person. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2800.06s)]
*  And I said, okay, I'd rather pay $200 for a pizza. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2803.06s)]
*  Okay? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2807.06s)]
*  And I would pay $6.95 for the same meal, right? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2808.06s)]
*  Except that by social pressure. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2810.06s)]
*  This is how you lose control of your preferences. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2812.06s)]
*  It's a scary game. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2814.06s)]
*  But you discover that your preferences are people are happier in small quarters. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2816.06s)]
*  You have neighbors around you in narrow streets. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2822.06s)]
*  People are happier having meals. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2825.06s)]
*  I'd rather eat with someone else a sandwich provided with good bread, all right? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2829.06s)]
*  Not just whole bread. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2834.06s)]
*  Than eat at a fancy restaurant. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2835.06s)]
*  So it's the same. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2838.06s)]
*  They're discovered little by little that even from a hedonic standpoint, this sophistication [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2840.06s)]
*  affects the burden. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2847.06s)]
*  But aside from that, there is something also that from the beginning you realize that hedonism [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2849.06s)]
*  that pursuit of pleasure for pleasure sake, there's something about it that gives me anxiety. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2854.06s)]
*  So on the other hand, doing something productive, productive in the sense of virtual signaling [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2861.06s)]
*  is something that I think that fits the sense of honor. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2871.06s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2875.06s)]
*  One book influenced you early in life, say before you were 15 years old. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2878.06s)]
*  The book I kept reading is The Desert of the Itapari. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2884.06s)]
*  So even before you were 15, I was before 15. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2890.06s)]
*  And I read it many times. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2893.06s)]
*  I'd say before 15 I read Dostoevsky. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2895.06s)]
*  And again, I read The Idiot. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2899.06s)]
*  And there's a scene that maybe at 14 when I read it, the prince Michigan was giving the story. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2902.06s)]
*  It was actually all biographical work. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2910.06s)]
*  He said he was going to be put to death. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2912.06s)]
*  And as they woke him up and were taking him to the execution place, he decided to live the last few minutes of his life with intensity. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2915.06s)]
*  And in the bar of life, it's so pleasurable. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2924.06s)]
*  He promised himself if he survives to enjoy every minute of life the same way. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2926.06s)]
*  And he survived. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2933.06s)]
*  In fact, it was a superlateral of an execution and Dostoevsky. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2935.06s)]
*  And effectively that's how the guy survived. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2938.06s)]
*  And the lesson was he no longer did that. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2940.06s)]
*  It was like preferences of the moment he could carry on later. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2943.06s)]
*  He forgot about the episode. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2946.06s)]
*  And that marked me from Dostoevsky when I was a kid and then from a couple of sets to this first one. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2948.06s)]
*  What was your favorite part of the Bible? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2953.06s)]
*  I'm going to be honest. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2955.06s)]
*  The Bible is still conflict 20 names in the Bible. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2957.06s)]
*  So the final question is what is it that you do in your moments of solitude? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2962.06s)]
*  Math. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2968.06s)]
*  And that pleases you or that's a form of work that relieves anxiety? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2970.06s)]
*  No, no. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2975.06s)]
*  I only develop anxiety when I go to fancy restaurants. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2976.06s)]
*  I would have thought of something right. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2980.06s)]
*  But I don't have a... [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2984.06s)]
*  But math is... [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2986.06s)]
*  I like it. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2988.06s)]
*  People tell me that as people age, they like math less and math is a young man game. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2990.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2994.06s)]
*  It's more and more enjoyable. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2996.06s)]
*  So I do math. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=2998.06s)]
*  Mostly there's a Twitter math that I'm part of. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3000.06s)]
*  So there's always something to solve. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3005.06s)]
*  Usually the beauty of it is that it's totally applicable. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3008.06s)]
*  It takes between one minute and one day to solve one problem. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3011.06s)]
*  And you don't know. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3014.06s)]
*  And then this thing comes in and then I stop. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3016.06s)]
*  And based on your own upbringing as a boy, if you were giving advice to someone raising a child at the age of 18, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3020.06s)]
*  what would be the takeaway you would offer from your own life experience up to that age? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3027.06s)]
*  Become a doctor. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3032.06s)]
*  Get a degree from school but become a doctor by then. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3033.06s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time trying to get an A because you're not going to talk about it with Brian. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3036.06s)]
*  You're not going to remember all that shit. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3041.06s)]
*  But you always remember what you tried to read by yourself. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3043.06s)]
*  I remember the stuff I read by myself. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3046.06s)]
*  That I was driven. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3050.06s)]
*  I don't remember stuff I was given to me at school. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3052.06s)]
*  So it's an allocation of time. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3055.06s)]
*  But I discovered that I wanted to be a writer as a kid. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3057.06s)]
*  So I realized that to have an edge on the writer, you can't really know what people know. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3060.06s)]
*  You've got to know a lot of stuff that they don't know. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3064.06s)]
*  So I started reading books more raciously. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3067.06s)]
*  And also read books with some instinct that would be helpful 20 years from now. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3070.06s)]
*  So therefore it's not the latest non-fiction mess. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3078.06s)]
*  So I read a lot of stuff. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3082.06s)]
*  And I think that I would recommend that you read as much as you can. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3084.06s)]
*  And try to get the lowest possible passing grade you can. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3089.06s)]
*  And don't study stuff like history because it's going to be revised. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3093.06s)]
*  Geography, history, all these boring things like chemistry. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3098.06s)]
*  Math is probably the only thing you can pick up at school that's useful. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3105.06s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3110.06s)]
*  We now welcome to the stage Brian Kaplan of our Reverend George Mason University. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3113.06s)]
*  Brian and Steve Nicholas Talib will converse. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3119.06s)]
*  I simply will open it up by handing it over to Brian to start. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3123.06s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3128.06s)]
*  So actually this whole event started with two tweets by Talib. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3130.06s)]
*  The first tweet begins very promisingly. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3134.06s)]
*  Excellent argument by Brian Kaplan. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3136.06s)]
*  Not comma, but there's something central. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3139.06s)]
*  Convexity, trial error, and heuristic learning. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3143.06s)]
*  I sort of wrote anti-fragile using Healy's argument and transcending it. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3147.06s)]
*  Would love a discussion slash debate. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3151.06s)]
*  Tyler Cowley. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3153.06s)]
*  And then when I said I'd be happy to do this and I was willing to go to New York, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3154.06s)]
*  then Nassim wrote back, second tweet, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3158.06s)]
*  I will go to D.C. if you agree to read anti-fragile, including the appendix. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3161.06s)]
*  So put it on agreement, I have read anti-fragile, including the appendix. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3167.06s)]
*  And now I can see several possible central things I missed. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3172.06s)]
*  But since I've actually got you here, what specifically did you have in mind? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3176.06s)]
*  The first thing I wanted to discuss was something I call the Green Lumber Fallacy. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3181.06s)]
*  And let me tell you something, what it is. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3188.06s)]
*  There's a book called What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3192.06s)]
*  which in fact is the only book I think that's not charlatanic within finance. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3199.06s)]
*  Tell you how not to lose money because it's much more robust than how to make money. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3204.06s)]
*  And the fellow who wrote the book was giving his, you know, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3209.06s)]
*  was training the Green Lumber. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3215.06s)]
*  And he knew everything about Green Lumber, how it was made, the chemistry, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3218.06s)]
*  this, the weather pattern, this, everything. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3222.06s)]
*  And though that fellow in a bit, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3225.06s)]
*  an old fellow who was very rich, who made his money training the Green Lumber, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3227.06s)]
*  called Jeremy Siegel or Joey Siegel or something like that. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3232.06s)]
*  And that fellow, one day, the narrator who lost all his money, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3235.06s)]
*  that fellow who discovered didn't know that Green Lumber was not lumber painted green. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3240.06s)]
*  It was freshly cut lumber. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3247.06s)]
*  So the lesson that from the outside, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3249.06s)]
*  it's not that the fellow Siegel knew nothing about lumber. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3254.06s)]
*  He knew a lot of stuff, but not the stuff you're naively inclined to know. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3259.06s)]
*  And that's certainly not the fallacy. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3265.06s)]
*  So that's the first thing, an anti-fragile matter that revealing, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3267.06s)]
*  because I was a trader. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3270.06s)]
*  Was that something I missed? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3272.06s)]
*  Because the stuff that they, the point is that they're hidden secrets within a profession, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3274.06s)]
*  can only be discovered within a profession, not outside the profession. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3280.06s)]
*  So that's a traditional form. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3284.06s)]
*  The second one is a convexity argument. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3287.06s)]
*  That in real life, we operate not by top-down knowledge, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3290.06s)]
*  but by trial and error. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3294.06s)]
*  And can have sex with the salt experiment. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3296.06s)]
*  The second experiment is if you went and rounded up every single chemist in town, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3299.06s)]
*  on one hand, and the other part would be to round up every single overweight person [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3304.06s)]
*  you can find who wears a jacket or was sort of well dressed. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3312.06s)]
*  So we have two groups of people. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3315.06s)]
*  And then you want to engineer the best possible recipe. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3317.06s)]
*  What's your favorite dish? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3322.06s)]
*  Venison and Alfredo. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3324.06s)]
*  Alfredo. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3325.06s)]
*  The chemist would have to work out the equations. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3327.06s)]
*  And we have so many chemists here, NIH and all that sort of stuff. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3330.06s)]
*  We have a lot of chemists. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3333.06s)]
*  So you have five, six hundred chemists working on equations only. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3335.06s)]
*  And the other people, the fat world rest people, would be, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3338.06s)]
*  there was a following, you take an existing recipe, you randomize, okay, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3343.06s)]
*  if you have an improvement in a taste, you add something to the recipe, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3350.06s)]
*  if you have an improvement, you keep it, you ratchet up. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3355.06s)]
*  And if you have a degradation, you just give the food to the chemist who won't notice the difference. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3358.06s)]
*  And so in one hand, you've got to ratchet up by trial and error, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3365.06s)]
*  convex trial and error, because the errors don't cost you anything. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3369.06s)]
*  It's like an option. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3372.06s)]
*  You have optionality on what to keep or not to keep. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3373.06s)]
*  Optionality. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3375.06s)]
*  And then the other one is the top-down thing. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3376.06s)]
*  Now, the difference between them is optionality. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3379.06s)]
*  Okay, who's going to win? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3381.06s)]
*  Who's going to get your benefit machine at the end of the day? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3383.06s)]
*  All right, so I feel pretty good because that's close to my first guess about what you had in mind. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3385.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3390.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3391.06s)]
*  So my first guess was actually, you agree the traditional academic curriculum isn't very useful, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3392.06s)]
*  and learning by doing is, there are two things I said, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3398.06s)]
*  and then I missed the chance to explain why learning by doing works so well. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3400.06s)]
*  That sounds... [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3404.06s)]
*  I'm not blaming you, but I just want to use your argument for society to improve [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3406.06s)]
*  by maybe changing the way we teach people. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3411.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3414.06s)]
*  And also put some historical background, since we have Tyler here, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3415.06s)]
*  for, you know, to put some Greco-Roman stuff around it, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3419.06s)]
*  because the, you know, the Romans despised theory, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3424.06s)]
*  and the Greeks despised practice, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3431.06s)]
*  which is why the first, the last one is to mandelbrot a Greek among Romans, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3434.06s)]
*  and the next one is dedicated to Rod Paul, a Roman among Greeks. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3441.06s)]
*  So the Romans... [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3449.06s)]
*  So I understand that the engine behind everything is complexity. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3454.06s)]
*  The chapter, I think, of the comment I made was, I'd rather be anti-federal than smart. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3459.06s)]
*  It says I'd rather, because if you're... [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3464.06s)]
*  and you can model it, but I did a Monte Carlo, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3467.06s)]
*  showing the population of people who actually are stupid, but not very stupid. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3470.06s)]
*  But they do a lot of trial and error, and people are very smart, like the chemists, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3476.06s)]
*  but they don't... they can't do a lot of trial and error, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3482.06s)]
*  and then you realize that those who do trial and error, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3484.06s)]
*  if they have the intelligence to realize it, they will think out slightly better than the previous thing. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3487.06s)]
*  We've got far ahead, you need a thousand IQ points [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3492.06s)]
*  to match someone with aggressive legal trial and error. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3495.06s)]
*  That was the idea, that teaching people that, okay, is impossible, unless you have practice. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3498.06s)]
*  And so the root of suggesting education is you send people, you make people work as nurses, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3505.06s)]
*  and then they go to medical school. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3512.06s)]
*  And effectively, they'll have spoke to a lot of doctors, and they think it's a good idea, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3514.06s)]
*  because they're afraid medicine will be now to theorize, becoming to theorize. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3517.06s)]
*  You make people run a mafia school, mafia local, or whatever. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3521.06s)]
*  You want a racketeering shop, or a casino, or something like that, for seven, eight years, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3527.06s)]
*  and then you go study economics. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3533.06s)]
*  And stuff like that. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3535.06s)]
*  So we're living longer, so this idea of front-lining education makes no sense. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3537.06s)]
*  So there are plenty of countries where you don't have to get an undergraduate degree to go to medical school. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3543.06s)]
*  In the US, first you do an undergraduate degree, then you go to medical school. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3548.06s)]
*  Sounds like you were saying better to be a practitioner for four years, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3551.06s)]
*  and then maybe go to medical school, or just getting an undergraduate. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3554.06s)]
*  No, undergraduate, start undergraduate later in life. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3557.06s)]
*  At age 30, you have to think about that model. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3561.06s)]
*  I know because I started training. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3564.06s)]
*  I had no idea, first of all, I didn't like school. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3566.06s)]
*  I liked to read books, and I was at the EDD, so it was boring for me. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3569.06s)]
*  So I started training, and then I discovered math. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3572.06s)]
*  I said, oh, this is interesting. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3575.06s)]
*  So I started discovering math, so I got immersed into math. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3578.06s)]
*  And 15 years later, I went back to school. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3583.06s)]
*  So I went back to try to do math, and in fact, I was doing a lot of math classes, and I did my thesis, and that was it. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3585.06s)]
*  But the idea, and I started writing papers. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3594.06s)]
*  So the idea of having to start by theory and ending up with practice doesn't work. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3598.06s)]
*  You should try practice and theory. That's the wrong way. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3605.06s)]
*  So now what do you think about people who make the following argument? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3607.06s)]
*  Only you can decide whether it's a true black swan argument, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3611.06s)]
*  but people might put it forward as their version of black swan argument. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3614.06s)]
*  So a lot of people say, well, sure, virtually all of these subjects you're learning in school are useless, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3618.06s)]
*  but there were positive black swans. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3622.06s)]
*  Once in your life, an academic subject you studied is going to turn out to be absolutely crucial. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3625.06s)]
*  One example of this, there was a guy who said, well, look, actually, French was really important. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3630.06s)]
*  It was totally worth the time, because one time I was at Charlottesville Airport, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3635.06s)]
*  and if I hadn't spoken French, I wouldn't have missed my flight. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3638.06s)]
*  So you spent three years studying French to avoid one missed flight. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3641.06s)]
*  That seems like a pretty brief day. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3644.06s)]
*  But anyway, you can imagine someone giving something like that and saying, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3646.06s)]
*  sure, almost all the subjects are no good, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3649.06s)]
*  but you're going to get one polygamous black swan out of your whole education. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3651.06s)]
*  That alone makes it all worth all that effort. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3654.06s)]
*  The comfort argument is actually more potent. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3657.06s)]
*  You're spending how many hundreds of hours studying something you're not going to remember later, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3659.06s)]
*  but you could spend that time learning a craft like how to brake or to save. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3664.06s)]
*  You can learn it by the time. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3671.06s)]
*  So from the payoff, plus it doesn't mean that the other one won't have an equivalent amount of tail events that are positive. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3676.06s)]
*  So you're ruling out that the other activities would have a tail event. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3683.06s)]
*  There's something, the problem with education now is that it's a business. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3687.06s)]
*  So like any business, it's a future class business. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3692.06s)]
*  It's becoming a cover racket. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3695.06s)]
*  So it's very hard now to talk, to argue against education when we know all the empirical data. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3697.06s)]
*  If you want to have a few minutes to explain it, I'll say it in this. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3705.06s)]
*  We have all the empirical data at the individual level, education. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3710.06s)]
*  And then put it in the anti-fragile education, and it appears that it's good for you because it's a great way to transmit wealth for generations. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3716.06s)]
*  Because your children are certain to stay in middle class if you educate them. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3724.06s)]
*  It's a great way. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3731.06s)]
*  But at the level of the country, it doesn't seem to work. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3732.06s)]
*  And in fact, it's the reverse of anything. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3736.06s)]
*  And even more interesting is that people think that by educating people, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3739.06s)]
*  they're actually transmitting knowledge instead of technique. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3749.06s)]
*  Technique, because places like Germany and Switzerland, these places had a very low level of education. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3754.06s)]
*  Total education had a huge amount of apprenticeship and a huge amount of built-in. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3762.06s)]
*  So I was with Alison Oates at a party and we were saying that education didn't work. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3767.06s)]
*  And I was talking to her and I said, what are you guys talking about? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3772.06s)]
*  How education doesn't work? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3775.06s)]
*  What? Education doesn't work? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3776.06s)]
*  You mean knowledge? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3777.06s)]
*  She said, no, this is knowledge. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3778.06s)]
*  This works. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3780.06s)]
*  And knowledge will never compare to a party. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3781.06s)]
*  So education in terms of something formatted to be taught in school doesn't seem to work. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3783.06s)]
*  So that's his argument. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3788.06s)]
*  And the one he's presenting now, we're looking at either to go deeper into what's the reason or the other one is what is the alternative? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3790.06s)]
*  The alternative is more apprenticeship, isn't it? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3798.06s)]
*  How are we going to destroy that deep state of education that tries to sell you something for a quarter million dollars that's worth nothing? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3801.06s)]
*  And why should we have effectively knowledge or education or the academy that's formatted for something more optional and later in life? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3811.06s)]
*  When you're going to grad school, it's definitely something useful for you. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3824.06s)]
*  No? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3827.06s)]
*  What I usually tell people is say, look, the reason why school is great is that there's going to be something to learn there that's going to be invaluable. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3828.06s)]
*  Say, look, I agree that it makes sense to expose people to a variety of subjects, but it seems like it makes a lot more sense to expose them to 10 or 20 years of school. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3834.06s)]
*  To expose them to 10 or 20 subjects that are actually likely to use than 10 subjects that virtually no one on earth uses. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3840.06s)]
*  So rather than saying, let's make sure everyone studies poetry and art history and the foreign language in America and everyone learns a bunch of sports. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3846.06s)]
*  Instead of like, why not make sure everyone spends a few weeks learning some plumbing, a few weeks learning some electricity, a few weeks going and just learning some customer service. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3857.06s)]
*  So I say, yeah, you do want to have a diverse menu. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3864.06s)]
*  You don't want to lock a 12 year old into a career race well, but still far better to go expose them to a tasting menu of realistic options rather than the tasting menu of pipe drinks, which is what seems to be mostly about. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3867.06s)]
*  Yeah, but the root of that, my feeling, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon world is the desire, that is what they call liberal arts education, to aristocratize themselves. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3881.06s)]
*  Because in the beginning, let's talk about the great Roman world, you had the pre-Humor Quarantine, there was absolutely nothing practical about it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3896.06s)]
*  Rhetoric, grammar, so things that liberal education was what people learned to be, in order to become aristocrat and idol of the upper class. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3906.06s)]
*  And then you had the real professions, how to become a baker, how to become something that would look down. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3918.06s)]
*  And the English, upper class, of course, they didn't want to be working class, so they sent their kids to learn that stuff. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3924.06s)]
*  And this is what came to America. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3931.06s)]
*  So education is put in two, you have technical education like law, technical and professional education, law, medicine, what else? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3933.06s)]
*  Engineering, all these things, and then you have mathematics. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3943.06s)]
*  And if you look at it historically, the engineers didn't really connect to the other ones because the Roman engineers did not use Euclidean geometry. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3947.06s)]
*  And we only started using Euclidean geometry late in life after the educational system started including mathematics for these people. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3956.06s)]
*  The engineers built cathedrals like Euclidean geometry, and it was actually more of a must. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3964.06s)]
*  Euclidean geometry gave you these ugly corners, because they didn't know what the right angle was, whereas before it was more involved, it was rule of thumb, and it was different. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3969.06s)]
*  So they had a separate segregation. So what you want to do is, if it's liberal education that's contaminating the rest, or is it technical that's contaminating liberal education, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3979.06s)]
*  is it an expectation of education we should be having? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3988.06s)]
*  So you say, okay, this is the kind of thing you do like piano lessons, right? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3990.06s)]
*  And on weekends, you read Homer and stuff like that, it's important to become civilized. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=3996.06s)]
*  It's tough to be civilized, feel civilized, and be able to have dinner with the vice president and work back. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4001.06s)]
*  These are the things you do. And these are the things you do to get your head in life. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4008.06s)]
*  So your problem has been known as a problem ever since we've had the Roman Greece competing. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4013.06s)]
*  So my most controversial policy proposal is just less. So educational austerity, spending less on education. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4021.06s)]
*  I've noted that when someone says we need more money for education, the reaction is normally, yay, not what specifically you plan to spend the money on. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4029.06s)]
*  On the other hand, when I say let's spend less on education, the whole reaction is precisely, what exactly do you propose to cut? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4037.06s)]
*  Anyway, so not something a lot of people are interested in, but reading it through, I get the feeling that you might actually be willing to countenance [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4044.06s)]
*  a draining of the educational swamp through cutting off some of their money. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4054.06s)]
*  You bet. I went to India once, and I had no advice to give anyone. So I said, better open a thousand schools than one university. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4060.06s)]
*  I opened it, and I said that. And then sure enough, a year later, I see a headline, Modi, a speech saying, and actually I said that to Modi, to the president. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4075.06s)]
*  So I have a headline, Modi saying, rather open a thousand schools than a single university. And then the focus on what's the problem with India? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4086.06s)]
*  India, they have long educated people who know sociology, it's nice, but it's the kind of thing for dinner with the VP at the World Bank, it's not something. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4094.06s)]
*  Whereas if you want to know how to do electricity, how to make batteries or something like that, that's more useful. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4103.06s)]
*  So now the trend is effectively to cure that problem of having theoretical education coupled with complete misery with something in the middle, which is technical schools. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4110.06s)]
*  So mainly a standard critique of Indian elementary education is that it's also terrible, the teachers don't even bother showing up, very little learning going on there. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4125.06s)]
*  Like a normal American reaction to say we need to go and get the Indian schools in order so that teachers show up and do their job. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4134.06s)]
*  And my reaction is more, given this has gone on for these decades, why don't we cut them spending first, and then say maybe even have some of the money back if you actually start doing your jobs. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4141.06s)]
*  It's better to teach people young, very young, to spend three or four hours doing something. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4152.06s)]
*  How did people learn medicine in the old days? It was a generational thing. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4158.06s)]
*  And your father is a doctor and you walk around with your father, or maybe mother, a lot of women in the health sector. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4164.06s)]
*  And then you learn, that's a professional state within families. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4176.06s)]
*  And there are secrets that are transmitted, they don't give to the outside. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4183.06s)]
*  Unfortunately we don't have because the problem is knowledge and education that is always broad and open. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4186.06s)]
*  Whereas transmission of technical skills are worked by gills and secrecy like the masonry, to the point that today the Romans had phenomenal concrete. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4192.06s)]
*  So I feel like reading a book, one thing we had in common is things that we've seen with our own eyes weigh heavily upon both of us. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4203.06s)]
*  So to me, a lot of my extreme negativity about education actually comes not only from my own education, but when I go to back to school nights, when I go to parent-teacher nights, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4213.06s)]
*  and I just think, well, if you were to go and tell these people, spend your teacher kids to go and learn how to do something, would I trust these people to carry out that order? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4223.06s)]
*  And my answer is no way! These are touchy-feely people who do not want to think about anything in terms of practical results. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4233.06s)]
*  They don't like the idea of there being, oh, like a test, like did he learn it or not? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4241.06s)]
*  Instead, for so many of the teachers I saw, it really is all about the experience, if you enjoy the experience. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4246.06s)]
*  And I'm there saying, no, it's not just about the experience, it's about do you know something at the end? Can you do something? Can you show me? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4252.06s)]
*  And don't say that it can't be measured. If you really knew something, you could come up with a test of measuring. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4258.06s)]
*  I think that the idea, again, that if we go back to the Asians, when you were learning a profession, you learned a profession from a professional. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4265.06s)]
*  You then learned a skill in the game. And I put in skill in the game what happens to fields where the feedback is peer review, not feedback from reality. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4275.06s)]
*  So in other words, the carpenter has feedback from his clients or her clients, whereas a macroeconomist has only feedback from Paul Krugman. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4286.06s)]
*  So it's basically closed system and they can give themselves no bells. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4294.06s)]
*  So there is a, when you want to learn something, you want to learn that this is why I have a section where for 280 years, there's fundamental problems with probability. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4300.06s)]
*  It's so obvious that Mary Gell-Mann picked up. Every trader knows, but nobody in decision science or in psychology knows because they're not risk takers. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4314.06s)]
*  So let's split into these two things. Learn from a professional who has done the stuff. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4324.06s)]
*  If you want to learn how to become a mafia lord, you learn from mafia lord. You don't go learn from Francis Ford Capola. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4334.06s)]
*  So you learn from the people who do it. And if you want to, so in the old days, the other stuff, you're supposed to be an auto-lydac. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4342.06s)]
*  There's a tutor who supervises what books you're going to read, but there's none of this classroom high security prison environment that we have today. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4353.06s)]
*  And that's a liberal education where you have mentors and you find mentors. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4362.06s)]
*  The English system still has these where you're self-directing, you're all learning. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4369.06s)]
*  So if you apply to high school, I think what I learned the most was from my years in high school, but not from high school. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4377.06s)]
*  And at some point, this great idea to be a Marxist for a few hours or a cross-geschist because it makes you read a lot of interesting books. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4386.06s)]
*  And then you go through these phases. So let's see, so we have to reform education, to turn people into auto-lydac. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4394.06s)]
*  Plus there's another thing. You cannot possibly trust two classes of people. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4402.06s)]
*  When the game is about educators who are better at explaining than understanding, because they're selected to be better. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4407.06s)]
*  And science therapists who are better at communicating than understanding. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4414.06s)]
*  Because then you end up with things like scientism. No practicing scientist would rule out skepticism and tell you the science is settled and stuff like that. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4418.06s)]
*  But these people have a mindset that science is scientism. Because they don't know enough science, all they know is how to communicate. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4430.06s)]
*  And that is a problem. So you're learning. You realize that you're not learning from someone who does science. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4438.06s)]
*  You're learning from someone who transmits science. And I tell you now, I was lucky that I didn't have a good math teacher when I was a kid. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4445.06s)]
*  I started zooming out, because then I wouldn't become a mathematician, I'm sure. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4453.06s)]
*  But I'm self-taught in almost everything that I really like. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4457.06s)]
*  But teaching, the way they teach you mathematics, is really to deter you from liking mathematics. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4461.06s)]
*  So you probably don't get this a lot, but when I was reading Anti-Fragile, I often kept thinking, my God, he's such an optimist. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4468.06s)]
*  I can't believe that he thinks the world works this well. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4476.06s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm an optimist. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4479.06s)]
*  Yes, but this is a great system. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4481.06s)]
*  So like what you said, you either learn from peers or reality. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4483.06s)]
*  How about the thing that usually happens, which is that you are learning from a person who doesn't even know the subject they are teaching. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4488.06s)]
*  Which is what I see happening in so many classrooms. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4494.06s)]
*  When I see history teachers who know less history than the better students in the class, and these are the teachers. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4496.06s)]
*  And I say, look, I'd rather that they have someone, there's someone you're talking about, someone who only knows what they know in books, but at least they know that. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4504.06s)]
*  So I'd rather have that person teach me in the class. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4511.06s)]
*  What's happening now more and more in education, is that how do you become a professor at tenure? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4513.06s)]
*  By writing some kind of garbage about something. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4519.06s)]
*  So for example, I was trying to read something about the Republican letters. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4521.06s)]
*  And it was all on Wikipedia and all the commentaries was about gender studies. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4528.06s)]
*  I don't want the theory, but I wanted the facts and you can get the facts. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4533.06s)]
*  So we end up with a lot of people, in fact, today, the generation because of the competitive environment and a closed circuit in the humanities that basically don't know anything about humanities. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4537.06s)]
*  All they know the theories, we sure about this, this and the post-colonial approach to this and that. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4548.06s)]
*  And for example, when you start arguing with people who studied about something called Middle Eastern studies, which shouldn't exist at this time, they start talking about colonialism. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4554.06s)]
*  The French spent 21 and a half years in the Levant, right? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4564.06s)]
*  And as they say, the United Nations mandate, they explain to me the colonialism. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4569.06s)]
*  They say, well, they don't even know the basic facts. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4573.06s)]
*  Because the more you have a ratio of theories and the more is this and stuff like that. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4577.06s)]
*  And so someone is going to Marxist interpretation of this and this is the post-gender world. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4583.06s)]
*  But they don't know the facts. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4589.06s)]
*  So this is why you can't rely on these instructors to teach you the humanities because you don't get tenure from knowing the facts. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4591.06s)]
*  You get tenure from inventing some post-structural theory of baking beans and mint, sassanay and the purja. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4597.06s)]
*  That's how you get your tenure. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4607.06s)]
*  So these guys are ignorant. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4609.06s)]
*  Wouldn't it be a big step up if we replaced current academics with equally highly tower academics who just have a command of the facts? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4611.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4619.06s)]
*  But how do you select for these? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4620.06s)]
*  Well, basically in Europe, for example, they have a separation between researchers and their transfer, for example. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4622.06s)]
*  So instructors are supposed to know the curriculum. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4629.06s)]
*  Actually, they're tested, not I guess you all are tested on a subject. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4632.06s)]
*  So and the people who produce papers go for newspapers that nobody reads and put your energy there. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4636.06s)]
*  And we're going to give you a good lifestyle and some income that's lower middle class, right? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4642.06s)]
*  For researching and leave a salon. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4648.06s)]
*  Leave a salon. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4650.06s)]
*  So this is how we say it. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4651.06s)]
*  And then you get the people who instruct you history lessons, know actually some history. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4652.06s)]
*  You don't have that in a more competitive environment. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4659.06s)]
*  So one argument that I made is that almost every student has an intuitive understanding of the signaling model that I'm defending in my book, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4662.06s)]
*  where I say the main thing you're trying to do is impress employers, not actually learn the material. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4669.06s)]
*  And here's a passage out from Eddie Bradshaw that is very signaling friendly. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4674.06s)]
*  Quote, I wasn't exactly not a dydex since I didn't get degrees. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4679.06s)]
*  I was rather a barbell auto dydex as I studied the exact minimum necessary to pass any exam overshooting accidentally once in a while and only getting in trouble a few times by undershooting. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4682.06s)]
*  So would you say that you had an intuitive understanding of the signaling model? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4693.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4697.06s)]
*  Getting the stamp on your forehead. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4698.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4700.06s)]
*  I decided to come to work, you know, the center of the school in America. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4701.06s)]
*  Why this was very difficult to do. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4706.06s)]
*  So that's OK. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4708.06s)]
*  Let me try. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4709.06s)]
*  What do you have to do? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4710.06s)]
*  You have to take this test. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4711.06s)]
*  So what do you do? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4712.06s)]
*  This is GMAT or something like that scores. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4713.06s)]
*  So you go in and you spend the day. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4716.06s)]
*  You buy a lot of coffee, lock yourself up for months taking these and then you go take the test. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4718.06s)]
*  And first of all, you forget right after once you've taken the test. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4725.06s)]
*  And you go to business school where you realize that business school is mostly a way to meet people or give you a job. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4728.06s)]
*  The first job after business school. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4735.06s)]
*  And everybody will forget. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4737.06s)]
*  You know, that's the phase two that doesn't count anymore. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4739.06s)]
*  And then later on, I became an employer when I was employed and never had anybody to go to business school. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4742.06s)]
*  No one who was signaling. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4748.06s)]
*  And plus they come and argue. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4750.06s)]
*  So you hire someone from. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4752.06s)]
*  For example, you notice there's something. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4754.06s)]
*  If you went to business school, unless you went to the top 20, at the time it was a waste of money. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4756.06s)]
*  But the mathematics, if you go to the top 25,000 school, number 25,000 is still useful. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4761.06s)]
*  So you realize that there's some things that can be taught in the infrastructure environment. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4771.06s)]
*  Like engineering, mathematics or chemistry or belly dancing or stuff like that. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4776.06s)]
*  So where business school you have no skills. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4782.06s)]
*  Basically. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4784.06s)]
*  So it's a signal link that you discover. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4785.06s)]
*  But I didn't need the signal link beyond my first job. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4789.06s)]
*  So we all know you're a maverick. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4793.06s)]
*  But suppose that you had undershot very consistently in academics. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4795.06s)]
*  You had finished degrees. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4802.06s)]
*  Do you think you would still be where you are today? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4804.06s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4806.06s)]
*  This is the problem of society because the way it was organized. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4807.06s)]
*  First of all, I was civil war Lebanon. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4810.06s)]
*  So if it weren't, I had a family of money that had been writing bad poetry. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4812.06s)]
*  And I said maybe you failed novel or something. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4819.06s)]
*  So that wasn't my life. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4821.06s)]
*  That was the product, the reaction against war, the anxiety, displacement, the moving from it. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4823.06s)]
*  So you have anxiety because being Christian from the area, you don't know. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4831.06s)]
*  And it's very scary to be Christian from the area, particularly at the time. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4835.06s)]
*  So this is why I want to make it. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4839.06s)]
*  So you want to get the degrees, you want to do this, you want to do that, you want to buy a nice suit. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4841.06s)]
*  So all the signaling, you have to cover the signaling and on top of that, add the skills. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4845.06s)]
*  So that was what pushed me. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4850.06s)]
*  And effectively, I am certain that I discovered another thing. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4853.06s)]
*  That the pas de mat, pas de mat, effectively, I learned to say. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4857.06s)]
*  From antifragile, sorry, from the less book I have an interest in addiction. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4861.06s)]
*  I'm not addicted myself, but I had a family member, but I was okay. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4868.06s)]
*  So discover how smart addicts are at procuring money for their addiction. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4873.06s)]
*  But they're incapable of making money outside of that. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4880.06s)]
*  So it's like some skills, some kind of gland that comes in and stop producing IQ when they want the drugs. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4884.06s)]
*  And then they can find these ways to make money for the drug and not elsewhere. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4891.06s)]
*  So I started thinking about it and I explained that when I started training, effectively under the pressure, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4896.06s)]
*  you're so much in trouble, you have to say, you learned a lot of stuff by probability. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4902.06s)]
*  And you start high dimensional matrices and get it inverted by tomorrow morning. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4908.06s)]
*  And you end up inverting it. And then you don't know how you got the result. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4913.06s)]
*  And you show it to mathematicians, they don't believe you did it. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4916.06s)]
*  And then you did it, inverting on smoke at a time, computer time. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4918.06s)]
*  So you push to do a lot of stuff under necessity, possessing another invention. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4922.06s)]
*  And the stuff you do then, that you learn under these pressures, you stay with you. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4926.06s)]
*  It's not like a drug addict loses back these faculties elsewhere. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4933.06s)]
*  So that was I was explaining how basically war was a way for people to learn stuff. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4936.06s)]
*  And effectively a lot of the inventions we had came during war, during the war. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4944.06s)]
*  So new war episode and of course the preparation for war. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4950.06s)]
*  So you've got to replace that model, of course, we're not going to wait for war. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4953.06s)]
*  And figure out how to force people to learn by getting in trouble. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4958.06s)]
*  And another mode of learning, to activate, to regulate something in them that makes them... [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4963.06s)]
*  So definitely not by putting them in a classroom and giving them credentials. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4970.06s)]
*  It's got to be something else. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4976.06s)]
*  Plus there's another thing about you that I disagree with you on one point, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4977.06s)]
*  that you have your metric to gauge if education is good, is performance on the job. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4980.06s)]
*  But it's a good metric for people who want to become employees. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4989.06s)]
*  But the world doesn't need people who create things. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=4995.06s)]
*  The artisans or people who invent things. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5002.06s)]
*  Because I have this idea that Bill Gates, as much as I hate him, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5006.06s)]
*  he should have created something. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5011.06s)]
*  Or Steve Jobs. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5013.06s)]
*  These are the people who make the engine work and the other people are just around. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5015.06s)]
*  So for these people, again, we've got to look at these people as disproportionate. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5020.06s)]
*  Pardon the sample, not the numericals they take. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5027.06s)]
*  That's where I disagree. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5030.06s)]
*  And then my idea of IQ, and I remember when I hired a trader, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5031.06s)]
*  you would not quiz them on something because you know they all have probably a very high IQ to get there. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5035.06s)]
*  First of all, we only hire people from math or physics or engineering. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5041.06s)]
*  So you have some kind of availability. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5045.06s)]
*  So they all... you know, the SAT tests have done it, correct? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5047.06s)]
*  GRE's have done it. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5050.06s)]
*  So what do you get? You stop. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5052.06s)]
*  I mean, the best test is you tell someone, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5053.06s)]
*  listen, I want a French suit and you have an hour to get it. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5055.06s)]
*  This is the size, this bottle is the size, and you have an hour to go get it in New York City. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5059.06s)]
*  For example, that's the kind of test we give people to see if they can go find that suit. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5064.06s)]
*  Or you give them projects instead of I want you to get me this, this, this, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5070.06s)]
*  and then you have an hour to do it, or two hours. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5075.06s)]
*  And to see how people... first of all, how people get confused at your request. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5078.06s)]
*  And this is the real IQ test. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5081.06s)]
*  Or possibly a test of common sense. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5084.06s)]
*  Psychologists actually do have a whole separate set of common sense tests, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5086.06s)]
*  which are interesting because common sense is something where people keep improving into their 50s, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5089.06s)]
*  unlike IQ where actually these sometimes are getting worse. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5094.06s)]
*  So these tests are actually pretty interesting. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5098.06s)]
*  There's tests like your car breaks down on a mountain road on a snowy night. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5101.06s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5106.06s)]
*  And smart 18-year-olds give answers to get them killed. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5107.06s)]
*  Whereas normal 50-year-olds give answers where they survive. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5110.06s)]
*  And you say, wow, right? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5114.06s)]
*  So there is actually something that's... [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5115.06s)]
*  No, no, there is. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5117.06s)]
*  I think of getting the suit as part of... [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5118.06s)]
*  A lot of it is actually testing common sense, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5121.06s)]
*  which is important but actually a different kind of skill. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5123.06s)]
*  But that's a central skill you need. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5126.06s)]
*  Yeah, it is important. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5128.06s)]
*  There's a skill you need. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5130.06s)]
*  It's how do you make it from an airport and get me an Auntie Anne. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5131.06s)]
*  I like Auntie Anne. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5135.06s)]
*  She eats a canes butter, right? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5136.06s)]
*  And then you have 25 minutes to get one. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5138.06s)]
*  And then no internet at a time. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5140.06s)]
*  It's not going to be a search engine. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5142.06s)]
*  So these are the tests that really will tell you if the person will succeed [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5144.06s)]
*  unless he's starting an international production. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5148.06s)]
*  What do we do when the car breaks down? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5152.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5154.06s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5157.06s)]
*  The original tests were actually written before the cell phone. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5161.06s)]
*  So then it normally involved getting on the other side of the barrier [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5163.06s)]
*  and then walking carefully to a call box. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5167.06s)]
*  It's winding down the road. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5170.06s)]
*  A lot of people say try to wave down a car, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5172.06s)]
*  but it's winding down the road so they get hit by the car. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5174.06s)]
*  So get on the other side of the barricade [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5176.06s)]
*  and then very good, holding the barricade, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5178.06s)]
*  walk to the call box, and then call for help [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5182.06s)]
*  is a pretty good answer to that. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5185.06s)]
*  So totally different question. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5187.06s)]
*  So it seems like you and I are very much on the same page [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5190.06s)]
*  on the value of vocational education. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5193.06s)]
*  There were a lot of academics who say, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5196.06s)]
*  Vocational education is no good because you never know [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5199.06s)]
*  if any vocation is going to be wiped out. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5201.06s)]
*  So one of the referees said, oh, should we send them to go to [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5203.06s)]
*  tight-breed repair school? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5206.06s)]
*  And no, you shouldn't send them tight-breed repair school. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5208.06s)]
*  Now my answer here is, look, it's better to go and train people [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5211.06s)]
*  for things that seem likely to be useful, like plumbing, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5214.06s)]
*  than to train them for things we know are not going to be useful, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5218.06s)]
*  like poetry. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5221.06s)]
*  So if we know anything about the economy in 40 years, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5222.06s)]
*  you said poetry will not be a big part of the economy. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5225.06s)]
*  So what do you think about this? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5228.06s)]
*  There's a separation of things you do to become civilized, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5231.06s)]
*  things you do to make money the other day around, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5235.06s)]
*  and people conflate one for the other. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5237.06s)]
*  And to come back to reiterate, for the moment, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5239.06s)]
*  geometry was not something like poetry. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5243.06s)]
*  It was something you do as an intellectual exercise [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5245.06s)]
*  that was not required because it actually degrades the way [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5249.06s)]
*  they made it. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5252.06s)]
*  And conflating the two has actually led to a lot of problems. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5253.06s)]
*  So the first thing we've got to establish is that we have [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5256.06s)]
*  another bigger problem. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5260.06s)]
*  The bigger problem is, of course, where is the propaganda [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5261.06s)]
*  that we're getting? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5264.06s)]
*  It looks like the ratio of theories and what you call [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5265.06s)]
*  indoctrination to facts is very high in the humanities. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5270.06s)]
*  And effectively, it stays low in mathematics because you can't [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5275.06s)]
*  really have, although we have proposals to have, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5278.06s)]
*  to remove square root of minus one because it was too [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5282.06s)]
*  phallic or something. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5288.06s)]
*  And I think it was so callous with those. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5290.06s)]
*  But it was a bit mathematical, stuff like that. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5293.06s)]
*  So you separate these two by institutions that are completely [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5296.06s)]
*  isolated from one another. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5299.06s)]
*  The things you do to become civilized, like the history of [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5301.06s)]
*  Scotland and the things you do for skills. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5303.06s)]
*  If we bring that back, computer science, accounting, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5308.06s)]
*  and even business school, I know there's two classes that were [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5311.06s)]
*  useful for me. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5314.06s)]
*  Law, business law, and accounting. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5315.06s)]
*  But then these, I didn't need business school for them. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5318.06s)]
*  You can go get them from... [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5320.06s)]
*  So actually, I'm doing something on the side, people who are in [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5323.06s)]
*  the risk business, myself and a former Renaissance partner, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5330.06s)]
*  and a third person, the three of us, our faculty, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5335.06s)]
*  or even the client, the mathematicians, the three of us. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5341.06s)]
*  And we're teaching people risk from a risk taker standpoint. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5344.06s)]
*  And the demand is huge, okay, but people want to learn from [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5350.06s)]
*  professionals, so you may have a model of accountants, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5354.06s)]
*  teaching accountants. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5357.06s)]
*  This person teaching that one as a certificate that you can get [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5359.06s)]
*  throughout your life rather than have a blocked education, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5362.06s)]
*  and then you go to the shop market. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5366.06s)]
*  So to me, like the risk business, I treat it like plumbing. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5369.06s)]
*  It's like being a plumber. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5373.06s)]
*  It has a lot of stuff that you can only learn from being a [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5375.06s)]
*  plumber from a plumber. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5377.06s)]
*  You can't have an English teacher also teach you plumbing. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5378.06s)]
*  So these professionals should be isolated from the humanities, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5381.06s)]
*  and they will become civilized. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5386.06s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that we should eliminate poetry from [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5388.06s)]
*  school, we should have people who do that like the new [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5390.06s)]
*  piano, the piano lessons. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5393.06s)]
*  I can just interject with the question. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5395.06s)]
*  I'd like a sentence from each of you. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5396.06s)]
*  What you see is the biggest difference between you, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5398.06s)]
*  because you agree on a lot. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5401.06s)]
*  But let me give you my one-sentence tape. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5402.06s)]
*  And what I've heard is the biggest difference. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5404.06s)]
*  The extent to which you take a kind of shaped civilization for [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5406.06s)]
*  granted is different. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5410.06s)]
*  To Brian, you take it for granted. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5412.06s)]
*  You don't think formal education is so much needed to [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5414.06s)]
*  produce it. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5417.06s)]
*  And Nassim, you're taking it less for granted in a particular [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5418.06s)]
*  way, and you still see some room for poetry, the humanities, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5421.06s)]
*  and so on, provided they're treated the proper way and [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5424.06s)]
*  segregated from the actual doing of stuff. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5427.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5430.06s)]
*  Each of you can hear it. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5431.06s)]
*  That was my takeaway. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5432.06s)]
*  That's exactly my take. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5433.06s)]
*  I want to separate things you do to be civilized, liberal arts, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5435.06s)]
*  from things you do to be effective. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5440.06s)]
*  And this is why. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5443.06s)]
*  I mean, I do a lot of mathematics, but I know the [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5444.06s)]
*  mathematics are not purely for pleasure, not for anything [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5446.06s)]
*  practical. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5449.06s)]
*  And of course, I do other technical stuff that are not [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5450.06s)]
*  very practical, statistics, stuff like that. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5452.06s)]
*  And some mathematics, applied math. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5454.06s)]
*  What I've played with geometry is an absolutely [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5457.06s)]
*  non-practical thing. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5459.06s)]
*  And I do it like I would with poetry. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5460.06s)]
*  And so long as you separate these two, you have a barbell. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5462.06s)]
*  This is this and this is that. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5465.06s)]
*  And you separate the two of them. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5467.06s)]
*  Then you will avoid the problems we have. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5469.06s)]
*  And also, you should have the professional stuff. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5472.06s)]
*  Okay, talk to children, a lot of professionals of that field. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5475.06s)]
*  And you should have the humanities or stuff, talk by [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5480.06s)]
*  people who like that stuff. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5484.06s)]
*  And I would say, I don't take civilization for granted at all. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5486.06s)]
*  What I say is that it can't possibly be the case that [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5490.06s)]
*  education in liberal arts and humanities is causing [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5493.06s)]
*  civilization or sustaining it. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5496.06s)]
*  Because virtually no one acquires this knowledge. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5498.06s)]
*  So given that almost no adult can answer even basic [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5500.06s)]
*  questions about this stuff, I don't see how you can say [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5503.06s)]
*  that schools are saving civilization because they [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5505.06s)]
*  aren't achieving the goal that allegedly is required to [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5507.06s)]
*  sustain it. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5510.06s)]
*  I actually agree with you. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5511.06s)]
*  I think that at one point, they're destroying civilization. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5512.06s)]
*  They're destroying civilization, the classics. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5517.06s)]
*  I think we should separate the holy and the profane. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5522.06s)]
*  And then you should keep things in the holy instead of [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5525.06s)]
*  the profane. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5528.06s)]
*  And I think that they destroyed the Latin language as well as [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5529.06s)]
*  the Catholic Church. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5533.06s)]
*  One comment again from theology, when they translated [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5535.06s)]
*  the text from Latin or from vulgar Latin into vernaculars. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5539.06s)]
*  Because then why didn't we try to market our religion as [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5546.06s)]
*  something useful? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5550.06s)]
*  Because before it was something worldly, it's all things. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5552.06s)]
*  And you notice that the reason the Pope presented, he said, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5555.06s)]
*  is to increase the number of Catholics. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5559.06s)]
*  In fact, the Church contracted at a time, but don't compare it [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5564.06s)]
*  to Islam, where you have one and a half billion Muslims praying [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5568.06s)]
*  in the nation who don't understand. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5573.06s)]
*  So you have exactly the same thing. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5575.06s)]
*  Separate the holy and the profane. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5579.06s)]
*  Don't translate the vernacular, the beautiful Latin things. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5582.06s)]
*  Likewise, do not try to make poetry or literature or history, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5588.06s)]
*  do not make it practical. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5594.06s)]
*  Just make that people study it for their own sake. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5596.06s)]
*  It's like you go to church. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5599.06s)]
*  It's not for anything practical. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5601.06s)]
*  Don't go to church because you're going to meet an employer. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5602.06s)]
*  You go to church, we go to church. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5604.06s)]
*  And likewise, so it has a separate issue. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5606.06s)]
*  Closing stage from you, Ryan. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5610.06s)]
*  So I've just got one question left. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5612.06s)]
*  I really desperately want to signal that I did read the appendix, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5614.06s)]
*  so I have a question about the appendix. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5616.06s)]
*  Yes, that's the question and answer. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5618.06s)]
*  All right. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5620.06s)]
*  So you wrote, it's often easier to modify f of x than to get [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5621.06s)]
*  better knowledge of x. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5624.06s)]
*  Now, when I was reading this, it seems like even the phrasing [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5625.06s)]
*  suggests that we should be weighing the relative ease of [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5628.06s)]
*  modifying f of x and learning about x case by case. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5631.06s)]
*  So suppose we're talking about the possibility that one day [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5633.06s)]
*  you're going to eat something lethally poisoned. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5637.06s)]
*  All right. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5639.06s)]
*  Now, one thing you could do is take a lot of precautions [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5640.06s)]
*  against using poison. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5642.06s)]
*  You could hire a poison taster or you could go and read up [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5643.06s)]
*  about what kinds of foods are hard to poison. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5645.06s)]
*  On the other hand, you could just go and say, hardly anyone [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5647.06s)]
*  today gets poisoned by, you know, this lethal poison one [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5650.06s)]
*  of their foods, so low probability and I'm not worried [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5653.06s)]
*  about it. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5655.06s)]
*  The latter reaction is actually my reaction. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5656.06s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5658.06s)]
*  Should I be worried about being lethally poisoned or not? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5659.06s)]
*  Let me rephrase the f of x and x and then you'll see that [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5662.06s)]
*  it was right and wrong. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5665.06s)]
*  So when I say that the fundamental problem I noticed in [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5666.06s)]
*  probability statistics is that people, you take x with what [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5670.06s)]
*  will stock market do tomorrow and you study the properties [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5674.06s)]
*  of x instead of study f of x, how it affects you. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5678.06s)]
*  You can have a payoff. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5681.06s)]
*  You change the payoff. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5682.06s)]
*  And so x is knowledge, which is exactly the left side. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5683.06s)]
*  That is one thing. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5686.06s)]
*  But don't conflate the conflation of x with the [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5688.06s)]
*  how it affects you f of x. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5691.06s)]
*  So for example, if you take random events, f of x is [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5694.06s)]
*  convex, you have optionality. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5697.06s)]
*  You see some people have optionality from random events. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5699.06s)]
*  Some people have negative optionality. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5702.06s)]
*  It's technical, but you know, we don't have time to explain [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5704.06s)]
*  it, but just for the point is one of them is knowledge. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5708.06s)]
*  The other one is how it affects you and what to do with it. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5711.06s)]
*  You can change it. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5714.06s)]
*  Like for example, one of them is what will happen if there's [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5715.06s)]
*  war and the second one is the insurance contract f of x. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5718.06s)]
*  When insurance company puts a clause, close my door, so it [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5721.06s)]
*  doesn't affect them anymore. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5724.06s)]
*  Put it in a clause. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5725.06s)]
*  So one of them needs a statistician. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5726.06s)]
*  The second one is a lawyer. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5728.06s)]
*  A contract, so you're mitigating your risk either by [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5730.06s)]
*  understanding the risk which is very hard or by having a [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5733.06s)]
*  lawyer who puts a clause to protect you from that event if [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5736.06s)]
*  it happens. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5740.06s)]
*  That's f of x. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5741.06s)]
*  So the idea is that there's a conflation of x with the [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5742.06s)]
*  f of x. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5745.06s)]
*  I'm not saying that we should ignore x or ignore f of x. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5746.06s)]
*  I'm saying that we should know whether you're dealing with x [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5749.06s)]
*  or f of x. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5752.06s)]
*  Whether I'm dealing with a food composition or I'm dealing [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5753.06s)]
*  with how it affects us. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5756.06s)]
*  So that's the f of x. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5757.06s)]
*  So this is my answer. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5758.06s)]
*  And put it in the context of poetry is x, whatever it is. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5760.06s)]
*  F of x how it affects us. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5764.06s)]
*  F of x is the nickname and x is the episteme. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5766.06s)]
*  The ancient always said that the f of x is the episteme. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5769.06s)]
*  The ancient always separated episteme from technique. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5773.06s)]
*  The problem is as society got rich, everybody wanted to [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5776.06s)]
*  reach education by imitating the aristocrats with the [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5780.06s)]
*  illusion that it's going to help them get rich. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5784.06s)]
*  Whereas in fact it's the kind of thing you do when you're [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5786.06s)]
*  already rich. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5788.06s)]
*  And this is where Allison Hulff and Pritchard come in to [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5789.06s)]
*  discover that these educational things are effectively the [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5794.06s)]
*  product of society that are rich and definitely not [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5798.06s)]
*  positive to us. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7vrmKUaDIM&t=5801.06s)]
