Video Description: In this special episode, Tyler sat down with Jerusalem Demsas, staff writer at The Atlantic, to discuss three books: The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin, Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift, and Of Boys and Men by Richard V. Reeves.

Spanning centuries and genres and yet provoking similar questions, these books prompted Tyler and Jerusalem to wrestle with enduring questions about human nature, gender dynamics, the purpose of travel, and moral progress, including debating whether Le Guin prefers the anarchist utopia she depicts, dissecting Swift's stance on science and slavery, questioning if travel makes us happier or helps us understand ourselves, comparing Gulliver and Shevek's alienation and restlessness, considering Swift’s views on the difficulty of moral progress, reflecting on how feminism links to moral progress and gender equality, contemplating whether imaginative fiction or policy analysis is more likely to spur social change, and more.

Recorded May 22nd, 2023.

# Jerusalem Demsas on The Dispossessed, Gulliver's Travels, and Of Boys and Men  Convos with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [September 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhg1X1CYlmk)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I am sitting here in Arlington, Virginia with the great Jerusalem Dempsets, formerly
*  of Vox, currently at the Atlantic, Red across the entire world.
*  Today we're going to do something different.
*  This show is called Conversations with Tyler, but this time we're actually going to have
*  a conversation with Tyler.
*  So now we start.
*  Jerusalem, welcome.
*  Hi, thanks for having me.
*  We agreed to go away and read and then talk about three books.
*  So let's start with Ursula Le Guin, The Dispossessed.
*  The other books will be Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels, and Richard V. Reeves, Of Boys and
*  Men.
*  But Ursula Le Guin, where do you want to start?
*  Well I think I first read this book, I think I must have been early high school and I don't
*  know if this is what you were like when you were early high school, but I was very angry
*  about a lot of things.
*  Like it was hard to have conversations about anything to do with politics without getting
*  very upset or angry.
*  And that's I think what I mean a lot of my peers felt at the time.
*  And I think reading science fiction, it's like a way of having conversations about politics
*  without having to necessarily feel that.
*  And so it actually felt like a real entry point into how to start having discussions
*  without all of that sort of, you know, not that the emotion itself was bad, but that
*  it made it hard sometimes to have productive conversations if like you were overcome by
*  the things you were feeling.
*  So The Dispossessed is great.
*  I mean, I don't know, we can start I suppose with the maybe a really basic plot summary.
*  Do you want to do that or should I?
*  Well let me first say I also read it early in high school.
*  I was 13 or 14 and it was such a different reading this time around.
*  So the first time I read it, I didn't really like it.
*  I quite liked Ursula Le Guin.
*  But this one, it was somehow too, at the time, too communal to me, too utopian.
*  And of course, I read it now, it seems almost the exact opposite of that.
*  But do you want to start with a very brief plot summary?
*  Sure.
*  So there are two planets that are relevant.
*  They're kind of close to each other.
*  The first one is home to sort of an anarchist separatist cell that moved away from the original
*  planet hundreds of years in the past.
*  And then the original planet is sort of supposed to be more of like a capitalist planet that
*  looks a lot more like Earth.
*  And our main character is a physicist who travels between the two trying to bridge the
*  gap.
*  So I think that's like a broad summary.
*  That makes sense to me.
*  Now this was published, I think, in 1974.
*  Seeing at this time, it seemed to me to be the ultimate anti-utopian novel, that in fact
*  the collectivist society, you have to live together with other people who are strangers,
*  you can't rear your own children, there's very little freedom of expression, people
*  only get to eat two meals a day.
*  The way they talk about sex is not really very romantic, you might say.
*  And it seems like a horror.
*  I can't imagine the first time I read it, I thought, well, Le Guin is really on the
*  side of the communal society.
*  The other thing that struck me on my later reading of the book is just how anthropological
*  it is as a mode of presentation.
*  So as you know, her father was a very famous anthropologist, Alfred Krober.
*  At Berkeley, Le Guin's mother was a well-known psychologist.
*  So it's almost not science fiction.
*  It's an anthropological investigation of two worlds that we call science fiction because
*  we don't know where else to put them.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's definitely, I think it's referred to as an ambiguous utopia.
*  I mean, I think Le Guin is pretty clear that she prefers the anarchist world, but doesn't
*  shy away from the problems with it, which I think is usually the issue with utopian
*  writing.
*  Do you disagree?
*  You don't think that that's clear?
*  I don't think she prefers the communal anarchist world.
*  I think she has greater hope for it, but she's telling us, unless you come up with something
*  new, this is what you're going to get.
*  It's quite horrible.
*  The Terran, I think, ambassador in the work, he praises the non-communal society, Urus,
*  as the best of all the worlds that exist.
*  You know, Earth or Terra has also been destroyed, something that sounds a lot like climate change.
*  So the only place that works at all is the one that's a consumer society, has a lot of
*  gender inequality, rampant income inequality, and a lot of war.
*  I think part of Le Guin's message, which was very 1974, maybe more true than people realize
*  today, is you only get a shot at the good parts of the non-communal society by tolerating
*  this pretty high risk of war, that it keeps things dynamic in some way.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, the fact that she gives the pro- the prognosis from the anarchist world, and he's
*  the one who has kind of the major scientific breakthrough that everyone is trying to get
*  their hands on.
*  And you know, this is- the fact that she hasn't returned to his home planet at the end, he
*  doesn't actually- we don't know if he actually lands in a safe there.
*  I think it's like a clearer message of how- I feel like a lot of the words that she uses
*  to describe the capitalist society is quite disdainful.
*  Not that she thinks somehow that, you know, that her original world is perfect, but it's
*  like pretty clear to me that she doesn't think it's worth it.
*  The pain, the suffering, everything that's hidden there.
*  I mean, even the property owner who becomes friends with our protagonist is pretty upset
*  with his life there.
*  And I mean, at the same time, there's this larger point that she's making, which is that
*  you shouldn't expect any society, even one that claims to be utopian, even one that has
*  a lot of your shared ideals, to be satisfactory at any point.
*  But I don't know.
*  I think it's pretty clear that she has, I mean, as you said, greater hope for the anarchist
*  planet.
*  I view Shevek, the protagonist, the scientist, as pretty selfish.
*  He's quite a bit like Gulliver.
*  What he really wants to do is travel.
*  And one theme of this novel is that there are some things you can only learn by traveling.
*  And he learns those things.
*  He wants to learn them.
*  He leaves his family.
*  The very last sentences of the novel make it clear he comes back empty-handed.
*  For all the talk about the scientific breakthrough, I think he never has anything.
*  So there's never a part of the novel where it's useful or even revealed or published.
*  And when you read throughout how the breakthrough is discussed, it sounds like nonsense.
*  So I think there's a bit of underlying maybe satire.
*  Does he have anything anyway?
*  Yeah.
*  I think chronologically, this is the first of a larger series of works that take place
*  in the same universe.
*  And his breakthrough ends up being extremely important later on for future communications,
*  the Ansible idea later on.
*  I do think it's interesting that the thing that he takes back is that it's important
*  to have free flow of information.
*  He's obviously very frustrated by that throughout his time at the university.
*  But again, even back on the capitalist planet, there wasn't free flow of information going
*  on.
*  All the newspapers is just lying and making things up.
*  Other professors at the university can't even really talk about.
*  He feels uncomfortable sharing that he's dissatisfied with his home planet.
*  So I think there's this current here, which is just trying to really undermine the idea
*  that there are these ideals in the capitalist society that are actually...
*  It's his rival, Sebal, who more or less makes him leave because he can't publish the idea
*  on the communal planet.
*  And they all think he's a traitor for leaving.
*  They throw rocks at him.
*  One of the rocks hurts his shoulder even.
*  He wonders when he's coming back if they'll even let him back in or put him in prison
*  or maybe even kill him.
*  So it sounds quite fraught to me.
*  So we're hearing about that planet, or moon rather, from the vantage point of people who
*  believe in it.
*  But once you see through their descriptions, to me it sounds much worse than even Soviet
*  Union.
*  For a Soviet Union, you could keep your kids, right?
*  That was just understood.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think there's a comment made by a woman that he, Shevek, our protagonist, meets
*  on in his travels where she says that it's better to have the conflict outside of your
*  the conflict within yourself and that when you are forced, as they are in his home planet,
*  to never be able to kind of openly confront the political problems because the assumption
*  is just like there is no hierarchy.
*  There is no government.
*  So there's nothing to confront, which makes it actually quite difficult to confront the
*  very things that are causing distress.
*  And they realize that the real problems are within all of their own collective minds about
*  what are social norms or rules that are actually concerning them.
*  And I guess it just comes down to like, I don't know, from my perspective, yes, there
*  can be a lot of things around social norms and rules and things that are allowed to be
*  spoken about that are that can like stifle and reduce freedom.
*  But like nothing can be more stifling than like the state itself creating violence against
*  other people, which we see on the capitalist planet.
*  They're having a proxy war.
*  There's like an invasion of another country, which is meant to be a like allegory to Vietnam,
*  I suppose.
*  But even like there's a real present threat of danger and violence, which Chevek has not
*  really felt except in a brief fight that he has early on when he's a youth on his own
*  planet.
*  And so to me, it's just like, yes, there are serious problems, but you know.
*  But they do shoot at the more radical syndicalists on the communal planet, right?
*  And then Chevek realizes, oh, this is what our army always was about.
*  And there's this pretense that there's no government.
*  But in fact, things are centrally planned by a computer, a lot, Dara Nassimoglu, I suppose.
*  And a lot of it just doesn't really seem to be as it's advertised.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you do you think it's a feminist novel?
*  You know, again, I very much thought that the first time I read it.
*  And now I wonder.
*  So if you think about, you know, Chevek, when he goes to the more capitalist planet, his
*  real self comes out.
*  So I think it's saying how men and women truly are with each other.
*  It's very hard to change that socially.
*  So there's that woman he forces himself on.
*  You could even say he rapes her.
*  It's not a completed rape, but he she's saying no, no, no.
*  And he keeps on doing it in a way that is really well past any boundary point.
*  So it seems to me like anti-Marxist and anti-blank slate, that this is what people are like,
*  and it's how you're going to channel those impulses.
*  So I don't think it's.
*  I think it's ambivalent about feminism.
*  What's your take?
*  Well, I think that the message is that like, I mean, first of all, what happened?
*  He he he gets drunk on his on the planet for the first time and then he sexually assaults
*  this woman that he's friends with.
*  And I mean, I don't think it's about blank slate.
*  It's that he's entering a society with different incentives and different rules.
*  And that in a society that's been very clear, is very non egalitarian, where he has an
*  entire conversation with someone where they're very clear about the lower assumption about
*  sexism.
*  Within just weeks, he's able to understand.
*  And he explains to his friend that women here are they're just ornaments.
*  They're always below men.
*  And she pushes back on this slightly.
*  But at the end of the day, he's being influenced by the society around him.
*  I don't think something like that would have happened on his home planet.
*  He would have been constrained.
*  So I think it's hard to say like one of these is blank slate or not.
*  I think both of them people are clearly products of the institutions that are pushing behaviors.
*  Especially the thing about growing up in that more sexually egalitarian alternative that
*  inoculated him against those pressures.
*  It's not like, oh, he grew up in the nice communal planet.
*  He learned to treat women like human beings with individual rights.
*  And then, of course, he can just carry that training with him, which we would expect from
*  a normal human, even from a not so nice society.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I think it's like I think that's pretty clearly the case that the incentives and how different
*  people are viewed in a society matters.
*  I mean, we'll talk about Gulliver's Island pretty soon.
*  But the behaviors that people, I don't know, engage in are going to be extremely contextual.
*  Like if there are no laws or if there are no rules or mores around treating women as
*  inferior, then I think it's going to open up a lot of things there.
*  But also, I don't really know we should take Shevek to be some sort of hero, as you said.
*  There are a lot of problems with this character.
*  So it's not really clear to me that Le Guin is valorizing this man in many ways.
*  I think he looks worse and worse as the story proceeds.
*  As the story goes on, yeah.
*  But I think it's hard because, I mean, obviously Le Guin is a woman.
*  And it's interesting she chose to have her protagonist be a man.
*  And usually, I mean, that happens all the time.
*  All of the women are technically pretty siden and supporting characters that seem to only
*  in at least in Shevek's mind be pushing his own story arc forward.
*  But at the same time, they are and even like, you know, the woman who he befriends and then
*  later assaults, she describes her own agency as being secretly being able to like push
*  men behind the scenes to do what she wants.
*  And that becomes revealed to be, you know, kind of a farce in this society because she's
*  not able to stop him, obviously, from assaulting her.
*  And that's one of those things where I think Ursula is making a pretty clear comment that,
*  yes, there are there are problems on both planets.
*  But you know, here is a planet where even this woman who's clearly very wealthy, very
*  well connected, can't stop the stranger from doing the very bare minimum of not hurting
*  her.
*  So I think that she's making a clear critique of how feminism or women are treated under
*  capitalism, how they're commodified, and even the people who realize that commodification
*  end up hurting them because I mean, what is the same day that he gives this whole speech
*  about how women are treated terribly in the society that he ends up assaulting her.
*  But you know, none of that happens on his own planet, even though there are harms that
*  women are facing all the time being separated from their children, not being able to make
*  choices similarly to men around their life and well-being.
*  But you know, I think there's a clear difference.
*  I'm struck by the prison scene on Inaris, the communal society.
*  He's early in the book and the children.
*  He's one of them.
*  Then he's younger.
*  They're playing at prison.
*  And just how rapidly they become tyrannical investigators and violent and abusive.
*  So again, this idea that some vision of true human nature, it's just right there underneath
*  the surface.
*  There's nothing about egalitarianism that really changes it.
*  Or is it about men?
*  Because they're all boys.
*  Yeah, men also, of course.
*  No, but I mean, I wonder if that's what she's saying is that it's not about human nature.
*  Maybe she's making a comment about male nature.
*  I think she is.
*  I mean, left hand of darkness, which I assume you know.
*  The way you get peace is by having genders that only are capable of sex a small percentage
*  of the time.
*  And the implication is that's the one thing you have to do that will get you peace and
*  nothing else will work.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, neither capitalism nor socialism nor anything in between.
*  And I think it's this 1960s neo-Freudian, like Norman Brown direction, point of view
*  that everything's about like sex and violence and conflict and how they fit together.
*  And she's in a way anti-utopian relative to the 60s.
*  That's how I read her.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, one thing I thought about while reading this book was, I mean, I don't know if you
*  have an opinion on this, but I feel like people don't really write utopian literature anymore.
*  Do you feel like that's changed?
*  Oh, there's so much.
*  I see a higher proportion of dystopias, as Peter Thiel has argued.
*  The better things get, if you're going to be interesting, you have to actually create
*  a lot of destruction and conflict.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's hard because I see the value of utopia as trying to clarify what it is
*  that you're actually trying to get to.
*  It's not meant to be, we think that, you know, this form of society will necessarily come
*  about because of my preferred policies or changes.
*  But just, you know, if you could define what Eden is, then you can approximate it, you
*  know, as close as you can get.
*  And I don't know, it seems kind of sad to me that people don't really do that anymore
*  because obviously, even if, I mean, obviously things have gotten better on various measures,
*  but I don't think anyone would describe our current world as a utopia.
*  And you don't really see that kind of engagement.
*  I think there's a lack of cultural self-confidence that would be needed to do that.
*  And in that respect, our world probably, or the Western world, is worse.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, you look at cartoons from the 1960s, the Jetsons, right?
*  Like they have a flying car.
*  That's where the expression comes from.
*  They promised us flying cars and all we got was 140, now 280 characters on Twitter.
*  That was not a joke.
*  I mean, I watched that as a kid.
*  Everyone took it seriously, like, okay, I'm going to get my flying car.
*  I just have to grow up a bit.
*  And the idea that you could just apply reason and technology to problems and things in America
*  would keep on getting better was a very common view.
*  And if you wrote a novel in that direction, it eventually became boring, but people wouldn't
*  laugh.
*  I don't know.
*  So, I mean, is the idea then that there's like, or maybe there are other cultures who
*  are writing utopias?
*  I don't know.
*  You were the one who reads internationally.
*  I don't know of any, really.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, so, you know, like Asimov's iRobot, it's not a utopia, but things work out.
*  Like, oh, you elect the robot president.
*  He's a pretty good leader.
*  Different weird things happen.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they put it all together, even though at a micro scale, all the laws are violated.
*  And today, I consider it a kind of fictional story, illy-easer.
*  Well, the AGI is going to destroy us all.
*  It's obviously, you know, beyond dystopian.
*  It's just the end of everything.
*  People are like, la-di-da.
*  There was some investment bank, I think they issued investment recommendations, and they
*  said, oh, the stock will go up, the stock will go down.
*  And by the way, there's a 40% chance the world will end in 10 years.
*  And they started talking about currencies without missing a beat.
*  And our world, to me, seems like that.
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess there have always been people preaching doom, even people amongst
*  technologists, not just like Luddites or people who are very religious or finding themselves
*  in cults.
*  But there's usually, I don't know, I, again, the bulk of my literary reading has been like
*  20th century literature.
*  And so it's something that is very interesting when I read modern day to see that kind of
*  a shift.
*  If you were to sum up what makes The Dispossessed to you an interesting novel, how would you
*  put that?
*  I think that, you know, the ambiguity about what, I mean, clearly between you and I about
*  what LaGuinia is trying to tell us about these different systems is actually extremely valuable.
*  I find that, you know, what's really good about science fiction today, if you're reading
*  like Ted Chiang or you're reading, what is it, Children of Men who wrote that book?
*  Oh, I know who you mean.
*  Yes.
*  Chikovsky.
*  That's a bit older, isn't it, as a book?
*  Yes, but I mean, like just in the last couple of decades.
*  You know, they're really, really, really good at world building and being very, very particular
*  about the, you know, making the world as realistic as possible and how they would get there.
*  LaGuinia doesn't like dispenses with a lot of that and just tries to get you to a point
*  where you can actually engage with the ideas that she's working on.
*  I don't know, this is, I find like very valuable with science fiction that LaGuin writes is
*  that you can have, I don't know, it becomes very possible to actually engage with questions
*  of right and wrong in this, such a different context that she does bring earth in the mix
*  at the very end.
*  So yeah, I think that that's what's valuable about it.
*  What about you?
*  I like how it continually subverts my expectations, which a lot of science fiction doesn't do,
*  even if it's conceptually strong.
*  The societies are believable in some very real way.
*  Shevik as a lead character is quite interesting and strong and ultimately unlikable and just
*  the way, you know, I might want to look for.
*  And the theme of parallel worlds has interested me for a long time.
*  So it has all those things.
*  It's well written.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very much a novel of its time, but in an interesting way.
*  And I partly identify with that time nostalgically.
*  So to see how people frame the issues of gender and war and capitalism back then, I actually
*  feel those traditions have been somewhat lost and forgotten.
*  And this book is trying to pull us back to them.
*  I think it's also very interesting to see.
*  I mean, we talked about them as parallel worlds, but the way that the capitalist world views
*  this off plan is, it's kind of like declining mining outpost that like sends them what they
*  need.
*  And it's like almost like a mining colony is how they think about it.
*  Oh, sure.
*  It's like a prison, right?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So I mean, it's it's it's obviously we're starting with his perspective of growing up
*  there.
*  But even that is challenged by Ligouin too, at some point where you're like, oh, is this
*  even are these parallel worlds or these even countries?
*  And what's also interesting about it, too, is it started me thinking like, you know,
*  right, the travel book, I guess we're talking about Gulliver's travels soon.
*  You know, the travel book kind of presumes a level of like alien that is still left to
*  be like discovered.
*  And what's remarkable is that the two planets, they refer to each other as aliens all the
*  time.
*  And there's like some differences in physicality even as well as they describe.
*  But they've only been separated for a few hundred years and they've been in trade with
*  one another and in communication with the entire time.
*  And obviously, there are some real like, you know, there are some real barriers to engagement
*  with one another.
*  But the speed with which they view each other as alien and not like human is very interesting
*  because if someone were to, you know, who come to me from South Africa, I would not
*  view them as like a full alien person.
*  But to me, that's like I think a very weird shift.
*  The notion that you never escape your prisons, prison being a recurring theme in the novel.
*  And no matter how hard you try to hold away the other, you never escape it.
*  And you're always imprisoned both by yourself, your own institutions and by your relation
*  to that other.
*  I thought the novel was quite good on and ahead of its time.
*  Yeah.
*  The the only walls on the, you know, cap, the anarchist plan are the ones that surround
*  the space travel, the better the launching pad or whatever it is.
*  And that's like something that said very early on.
*  But then you discover throughout the book how much there are all these other sort of like
*  quote unquote invisible walls that he is kind of discovering.
*  And that's like made very, very explicit at times, sometimes maybe too explicit.
*  But, you know, yeah, I don't know.
*  I think it's also just like a lesson in how much, you know, you have to have an other
*  to compare yourself to in order to even understand yourself.
*  He's alone for a really long time.
*  And when he's doing his studies at the beginning or at the in the middle of the book and he
*  can't get these like scientific breakthroughs that he inevitably does get to.
*  And it's when he starts interacting with other people and making rebuilding those bonds
*  with other humans that you do actually get these breakthroughs.
*  So I think that's, you know, also another point in favor of Le Guin pointing out that
*  communitarianism is important.
*  We can jump around and come back, of course.
*  But tell me on your first read, what struck you most about Oliver's travels?
*  It was very readable.
*  I did not expect that.
*  I know that people talk about this like I mean, I think it's been billed as a children's book
*  sometimes. I don't think it's a children's book.
*  I read it as a kid.
*  How old were you?
*  I don't remember.
*  I would guess 10.
*  OK, very.
*  It might have been in a British tradition.
*  I don't even know or remember anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's very readable.
*  I mean, like the actual sentence level, it's like not very difficult to understand what's
*  going on, which, you know, certainly in 1700, that's like pretty remarkable.
*  But, you know, I guess I guess what got me is just how I don't know.
*  I think this right before we start the show, but I can't tell if I like satire or not after reading this,
*  because the book is, you know, Gulliver coming across these different people.
*  They're all fantastical.
*  It's kind of like fantasy in that way.
*  And, you know, he's he's satirizing the human condition.
*  He's also satirizing, you know, travel novels at the time, I suppose, as as, you know, either being
*  in the falsehoods or being fixed on really trivial matters or things that are just not that important or observations that are not relevant to a reader back home.
*  But I just I think I had trouble figuring out whether or not I find this sort of writing that useful.
*  I find modern satires to be very funny and interesting sometimes.
*  Like, obviously, I like, you know, was a fan of Stephen Colbert when he was doing that bit.
*  As a long lasting tool for understanding other people and other times, I find it kind of a barrier because how are you going to understand fully the context?
*  Like, I can get the very obvious points that he's making about humanity and it's like drawbacks.
*  But I think that you probably miss a ton.
*  And, you know, I did some like reading of the relevant contextual history.
*  But even then, it feels like would it have been more useful to have a Jonathan Swift just straightforwardly?
*  I mean, he's prevented from doing so at the time, say his views.
*  But then I also think it's a question of length, like a modest proposal, which is an essay.
*  It's a very hysterical essay where he proposes people just like eating babies as a solution to, I guess, too many too many children who are in poverty.
*  And, you know, that's very clear and obvious what's going on there.
*  But I think that in a lot of this length, I don't find it super long lasting.
*  I read this as a novel of ideas, satirical in parts, but not to me.
*  It's not fundamentally a satire that dwindles away.
*  And every time I read it, I have a different take on it.
*  So I think on my fourth reading of it, this is past that I thought, well, this is a Tory being anti-modern and skeptical of the science of his day.
*  That's a pretty common reading. It's not my reading anymore.
*  On this reading, which is maybe my sixth or seventh, but across many years, like I said, first reading, I was 10 or so.
*  I think it's actually a novel about slavery.
*  And in some ways, it's pro-science.
*  So the episode where he goes to La Puta and Legado, he meets all the weird projects from the so-called, you know, we would call them venture capitalists.
*  The plot to live forever, you know, have your brain hooked up to different devices, the form of artificial meat.
*  You could take it as a satire on Silicon Valley today.
*  And it's ridiculous.
*  Clearly, it's ridiculous in Swift's eyes, even though some of it has happened or will happen.
*  The version of, you know, we call now chat GPT, the books that write themselves.
*  But that scientific society, it's the only one where there's not slavery.
*  So when he goes to the Lilliputians, they enslave him.
*  When he's the little figure, you know, a brobding nag, they enslave him.
*  They make him entertain them. It's on and on and on.
*  And he gets tired of it. He begins to hate it.
*  And then the Huyninims enslave the Yahu's.
*  And at the end, they tell, you know, Gulliver, who's a stand in for Swift, perhaps.
*  Well, we're either going to kill you or enslave you.
*  You have to get out of here because in a planet of the apes like fashion, you could lead a revolt of the Yahu's against us.
*  And that, too, is based on slavery and caste.
*  And it's only the scientific society where people are curious and wacky and nutty,
*  where there's no slavery at all.
*  And it appears the most ridiculous, the least well-ordered, the one most based on dreams and fantasy.
*  Swift isn't, in my reading, not quite endorsing that, but just saying, like, look, give this a break.
*  It's not as crazy as it seems.
*  At least these people are running off with some other set of projects and not just brutalizing each other.
*  So that's like my seventh reading of the book.
*  But that didn't occur to me on any of the earlier readings.
*  So I'm not sure how hard to push that.
*  Yeah, it's hard because, I mean, if Gullah versus Danden for Swift, which I'm not sure about, you know, he spends very little time there.
*  He, like, kind of gets out pretty quickly.
*  He seems, you know, kind of he finds it kind of ridiculous.
*  He describes the endeavors as, you know, kind of straightforwardly, but in a way that, like, is very clear that he does not find it like a useful pursuit of time.
*  It's almost just like these people have no grounding reason and they're just sort of doing randomness.
*  I mean, the way he describes, like, the books that write themselves is literally just a bunch of random words, plates being moved around and stamping in different directions.
*  I mean, it's not it's it's there's not even supporting sort of thoughts behind it.
*  So, I don't know. I mean, you're correct that that is the only one without like explicit like slavery in it.
*  But at the same time, he spends a little time there relative to the other.
*  You know, the first edition of Gulliver's Travels, there's a frontispiece and a picture of Gulliver.
*  It's typically interpreted as Gulliver looking a lot like Swift.
*  I don't think that means per se he's a stand in, but you're at least supposed to wonder that he is.
*  I view Gulliver as just a super curious person.
*  Every time he gets home, basically within two weeks, he seems to have a nice wife, has a family.
*  He's got to go off again. And he's learned it's dangerous, but he can't resist.
*  In that sense, he's like, Shevik, you read this, you identify with him as troubles.
*  But I think if you step back and ask, is he really a nice person?
*  Not so obvious. No, I mean, he abandons his wife and children at the end.
*  He finds them disgusting, right? They're not, you know, horse like enough.
*  I don't know. I think with Gulliver, I had a hard time deciding whether or not he was smart or not,
*  because he would obviously be extremely self-possessed when he would come across a new,
*  either the giant species or the very tiny people.
*  When he comes across, you can say all their names really well, but I feel like I can't.
*  Is it Lilliputians? Is it the small people?
*  So when he comes across the small people, he wakes up and he's been bound by all of them.
*  He's able to free one of his arms and then has this thought like, you know,
*  after they shoot some arrows at him and it hurts, like they're around six inches tall each.
*  But I guess it's like a good hypothetical how many six inch people would it take to subdue a person.
*  But, you know, he has like he's very he has his wits about him enough to be like,
*  I should just not present myself as a threat.
*  And then again, when he comes across the other groups, he's very quick not to present himself as a threat.
*  Interestingly, the only people that he doesn't do that with are the yahoos at the end,
*  where those are the humans of the planet, but he views them as beasts.
*  And by this point, I suppose we're supposed to expect that the the like Gulliver has a very low position of humanity
*  and Swift has a very low estimation of people.
*  But, you know, at the same time, you know, he just he does the weirdest things like he pees on the Queen's tower
*  to to put out the fire because he's so much larger than the tower.
*  But then it becomes completely unusable because like, why would you want to live in this home that's been just urinated upon?
*  And it becomes a problem for him at the end.
*  And he keeps again going back out there and making decisions that end up with him deserted.
*  And I'm not sure what the rates of being lost at sea are at this point, but it just seems like it's kind of wild with him.
*  So I don't know. Did you think he's supposed to be smart?
*  I think he's maybe a reflection of the human condition that he is smart insofar as he's deciding to do nothing or to exercise options or to wait.
*  Like I'm in this new society. I don't know what's going on.
*  I'm not going to try to take all the small lily putions and crush them.
*  That would be a mistake. It turns out, in fact, there was probably some way they could have poisoned him or done him in.
*  So all the times he just plays wait and see it eventually works out.
*  OK, whenever he has impetus, he basically goes off into another misadventure and almost dies, tortured, enslaved, whatever.
*  So I think it's kind of Pascal's version of Pascal's commentary on mankind that the fundamental problem of the human condition is we just can't sit still in a quiet room.
*  And that's what Gulliver can't do either.
*  Yeah, I mean, so by the end, I mean, he is so enamored of the the whore society, which he views as so full of reason and so full of goodness and does not even have, I think, words for for lying.
*  Because why would you communicate to lie?
*  The whole point is that to explain and get across ideas to one another.
*  And he's so disgusted by his own species that he faints when he's told he has to go back.
*  He then I think he's considered or he attempts suicide when he's being taken home, even though the person who's helping him is displaying all of the virtues that he's just said he loves about the horses.
*  They're they're giving him their clothes off their back.
*  They're giving him money.
*  They're transporting him all the way back to England.
*  And he gets back to his wife and she embraces him and he faints again because he's so disgusted by her.
*  And, you know, I again, obviously, it's it's it's it's satire.
*  It's it's it's extreme.
*  But even by the end, he's meant to still retain this extreme disgust towards humanity because of this experience with the horses.
*  But like the whore society is like not good.
*  Like they're enslaving a bunch of people.
*  People who are probably descendant from Europeans.
*  Right. Yeah. But I take Swift to be quite critical of the women.
*  And there he's being satirical and he's so over the top in his praise that you just start thinking like, come on.
*  And it's a bit like how the problems in the communal society and the dispossessed are revealed more and more.
*  Well, the horses, it turns out they have this caste system.
*  Like how light or how dark a colored horse are you?
*  And today, certainly in Swift's time, obviously, you realize what he's talking about.
*  And they don't make any progress, unlike the scientific societies, which at least try to make progress.
*  All they're good at is poetry.
*  They're entirely conformist.
*  And I think he's just saying this is how things would have to be for these supposed utopian visions to be realized.
*  Maybe it's a commentary on Thomas More and other such writers to get to a utopia.
*  Things would have to be like this truly communal.
*  And that would be horrible because a communal society is wonderful at oppressing each other.
*  And I think the best you can do for now Swift and even Gulliver is actually the family unit.
*  I mean, is Gulliver happiest in the family unit?
*  I mean, he's not, but that's maybe the best you can do.
*  He's so restless. Yeah.
*  At the end of the novel, we're never told does he feel he need to go off again.
*  He did it a bunch of times with always bad results.
*  And you don't get any feeling that he's been cured of his wanderlust, right?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I think obviously the novel ends and we don't know if Gulliver has any more travels or anything like that.
*  But at the same time, it's I mean, I don't know if Swift is making a commentary on, you know, the only way for these.
*  I mean, he's actually largely not that imaginative about the structures of society from place to place.
*  Like there's always some sort of like oppressive king usually, except for the, you know, the final society.
*  There's usually there's like just very weird, bizarre punishments that they're being meted out there.
*  I mean, obviously there he's kind of de-saturizing just how ridiculous many of our own customs may look like.
*  That's the you can't escape your prisons point that I think is in Le Guin very well and in Swift very well.
*  I did not find the time with the scientists or the universities to be as I honestly set that aside quite quickly because it was such a small part of the book to me.
*  And so when I look at the rest of them, he's you know, you have this king that's threatening to just drop an island upon his subjects if they are disobey.
*  You have other bizarre articles of impeachment that are laid against him because someone in the court doesn't like him or something like that.
*  So most of it seems like kind of just a rebuke of royalism and like courts, which of course, Swift had his own.
*  You know, that faction is inevitable is a striking perspective from a 2023 vantage point.
*  So the whole notion of cancel culture and that's in Swift.
*  You know, there's the people who open their eggs with on the side of the big end or the little end and they're willing to go to war with each other.
*  That to me is very 2023 or at least 2021.
*  Or is that just a rebuke of the idea of cancel culture since it's just the same thing we've always been doing?
*  I think it's a rebuke of the idea of cancel. It's always been with us.
*  A faction is inevitable, which I take to be one of Swift's main points.
*  All the more clear when you read his directly descriptive writings like his actual policy pamphlets, he's obsessed with faction.
*  It's a common theme in early 18th century writings.
*  Britain, you know, Ireland, it's all full of faction and this is our fundamental problem.
*  And the other eternal verity in Swift, I think, is war.
*  And you see that in the different travels. So in his own time, it's basically a war every few years.
*  The Dutch, the Spanish, the French, something. None of it to us now makes any sense.
*  And I think one of the things Swift is showing us with these very odd societies, their wars to us make no sense.
*  And he's saying the wars of his own time from any future vantage point won't make any more sense either.
*  And that I thought he did very effectively.
*  Yeah, I mean, he's a pacifist in real life. So clearly that's where he's going with this.
*  You know, I was interested. I was really interested.
*  I couldn't tell whether he viewed women as better companions than men in this book or because, I mean, in his own life, he has I.
*  It's unknown, I think, whether or not she was his.
*  They were actually romantically involved, but he has like a female companion that he's had at least has a friendship with for a long time.
*  And, you know, in the book, I mean, his the person who treats him kindly and basically each place is like a woman.
*  You know, there's this little girl that takes care of him when he's tiny compared to the giant people.
*  And she makes sure that he's safely being carried around.
*  She actually like cries when he when she knows he's going to be taken away.
*  I mean, this happens again and again.
*  But at the same time, he like describes like women as kind of like, you know, grotesque and like very bizarre things happen with with him in the giant land.
*  And I don't know, what did you kind of think?
*  I've read quite a few of his letters to Stella, who's the woman you're talking about.
*  They seem really quite affectionate, not at all misogynistic.
*  I do definitely think they had sex.
*  They use the word coffee.
*  Maybe they were just drinking a lot of coffee, but they use it in such artificial ways.
*  I think that's their stand in word for doing it.
*  And that is he views the man as the war makers and the troublemakers.
*  Yeah, I mean, but he didn't love Queen Anne either.
*  He writes that satirical pamphlet that in Stravacean fashion is a criticism of Queen Anne.
*  So maybe it's about incentives there, too.
*  Men are in the positions to make trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't know, like he's obviously I mean, this is what's interesting what this book has that it's written.
*  I mean, he's writing it as a like a letter to a reader.
*  He addresses the reader multiple times in it.
*  What did you think? How do you think that he views the reader?
*  A bit of weary resignation, fear that the reader is trapped up in the silly factions of the time, as the reader probably was, but actually with some sense of hope.
*  And I read Swift as a great humanitarian who is extremely skeptical about moral progress.
*  And he thinks to evaluate all these other institutions, you need to understand the skepticism about moral progress.
*  So keep in mind he's from Ireland and the richest, like, quote unquote, most advanced society of his time is Britain.
*  And Britain is treating Ireland very badly.
*  He frequently refers to that as slavery. He calls it slavery.
*  And he always wants to be giving the Irish a better deal.
*  So I don't think he's entirely pessimistic, but he doesn't see the progress in front of him.
*  The very surface level with the reader.
*  It's interesting because he will he'll say things like, obviously, this will bore you.
*  But then he'll just tell it to you in extreme detail.
*  Like, I mean, things about like what he's eating or, you know, what he very bizarre anecdotes always about his bowel movements.
*  Yes, he's obsessed with that in many of his works.
*  Oh, really? What is that? What is behind that?
*  Psychologists have speculated it was an actual psychological syndrome of some kind.
*  But of course, we don't know.
*  I don't know. I thought it was it was I couldn't tell if it was again.
*  I've not read travel novels of this time.
*  And it's clear that, you know, there's some sort of like form to the genre that he's, you know, kind of making fun of at some points in the book where, you know, he's just like, you know, readers of these kinds of novels.
*  He'll like he'll like say that.
*  And then he'll like juxtapose that with a dear reader, like as if you're supposed to be different.
*  But then he'll provide you with the exact same things as if he doesn't actually have that high of an opinion of you as a reader.
*  All the talk about excrement and piss and all that.
*  It's definitely a swift thing. And you see it all over.
*  Yeah. Just how he was.
*  Yeah. But I mean, even beyond that, where he had this one passage where he goes into detail about the types of food that he was eating.
*  And then he was like, well, no one's interested in that.
*  You've written this is like, you know, this is the letters that you didn't have to include that.
*  So that kind of indicates to me this level of kind of derision for the reader that he feels like this reader is going to be interested in these mundane details that aren't actually important to the broader story or moral or message of the book.
*  And so Swift himself was abandoned by his mother in his early childhood for a while.
*  She went off to England, probably to work.
*  And we don't really know what happened to him during those years.
*  But Shevek also, he's upset throughout his life that he felt and indeed was partially abandoned by his parents for a lot of his early years.
*  So the sense of alienation in both cases, this obsession with the question, who are the we?
*  You know, for Shevek, is it the both worlds? Is it just my world? Do I really belong in the other world?
*  For Swift, how much should I identify with these strange beings, creatures, societies that are enslaving me? With whom should I identify?
*  He's alienated from his family. For sure, he keeps on leaving them.
*  But where exactly does he find his people? It's pretty clear that he never does.
*  And I think maybe part of it is just in both of these novels that none of these men would not be happy anywhere, like in any context.
*  That maybe that's a part of what's going on here is that there's not a society that would make Shevek happy when he's amongst the communitarians.
*  He's frustrated by the strictures they put upon him, but also he's frustrated when his friend critiques them and he's angry at him.
*  They get into a big fight over it. And then Gulliver, everywhere he goes, he has some sort of critique of the one place he doesn't as a place where he's treated terribly.
*  And it's like unsustainable for him to stay there. And you can't actually imagine him providing anything of use to that world.
*  He's literally just like an oddity that gets pushed out every once in a while, like these kind of dinner parties.
*  And part of it to me seems like, you know, it's, I don't know, to me it's like kind of an indictment of this sort of like traveling in order to find yourself or find something important or true.
*  Because, you know, in many ways Gulliver does not end up like more enlightened by the end of the book.
*  Shevek ends up right back where he was. His entire kind of goals to when he was moving there seemed like naive in hindsight.
*  I think that there's like maybe slightly that's a little bit too much in the dispossessed world because, you know, we know later on that his connections end up being the foundation for a really important technology that connects space, different planets.
*  But at the same time, like, you know, what was the point?
*  But still Shevek and Gulliver, they're the two people who know things that no one else knows.
*  Even reading about it, you can't really understand what it was like.
*  And it's raising the question, you know, the ancient Greeks are not knowledge is everything.
*  Like, how true is that really? What does it get you? What does it get anyone else? What does it get your spouse?
*  Both come home empty handed, as I think I mentioned before.
*  And they don't, neither seems happy at the end, but they had to do it perhaps.
*  I think I question whether they needed to travel to get the knowledge because, you know, Shevek is really pushed out of his framework of viewing his own society as utopian by a friend who has this sort of realization.
*  Never travels is within that, you know, community the entire time.
*  He just witnesses his own, you know, his own inability to get, you know, his own research done.
*  He witnesses a childhood friend of theirs get sent to a state and stay in asylum because, you know, he's kind of ridiculed after he does kind of subversive musical performance or theater performance.
*  And to me, you know, like that knowledge was there.
*  And I don't know. I mean, you're obviously a big proponent of travel.
*  But I don't think it makes people happier at the same time.
*  You don't think it makes people happy? Not on average.
*  OK. Some people it clearly makes happier.
*  You know, you have the desire to do it and you're unhappy if you don't satisfy that desire.
*  But on average, people are happier at home.
*  I strongly believe this.
*  Well, well, is it because you think they travel badly?
*  No, it's in the nature of travel.
*  What do you mean?
*  We're creatures of comfort, whether we like to admit it or not.
*  And that's also partly a theme in Gulliver's Travels.
*  And when you're traveling, you're discovering all these new exciting things.
*  I would say if I went to Eritrea, I would in fact be quite uncomfortable.
*  There'd be a much higher level of background stress.
*  Maybe two thirds of the value is both the anticipation and the memories afterwards.
*  And it's still worth doing. I want to go to Eritrea.
*  But no, I won't be happier when I'm there.
*  Or even when you're back?
*  I will be glad that I went.
*  But that's partly investing in the memory and the experience.
*  I wonder then. I mean, to me, I've always had this opinion that most people
*  would, I think a lot of people don't travel well for what they want to do.
*  Oh, I agree.
*  They end up getting sucked into doing things that would not actually make them happy.
*  And there are things that, like in many destinations, that would have possibly made them happy.
*  But that's endogenous. Let's not go on.
*  But the other thing is more like, I don't know, like there's this, there is, I feel like,
*  a large cultural message that you're not going to understand yourself if you don't go travel in some way.
*  And because of the ubiquity of that message, especially in the US and other Western societies,
*  especially when my friends went to, I have friends who have gone to study in Europe.
*  Like it's very push as an idea there.
*  You know, part of me wonders that like you actually are happier because you could at least say
*  that you have fulfilled that cultural norm.
*  You don't get embarrassed by saying, I don't have a passport or I've never been outside the country, which, you know.
*  Maybe it's harder to understand yourself if you travel a lot.
*  In a good way, perhaps, right? But you might rather have more questions than answers.
*  Understanding yourself is a kind of answer.
*  And if you just think I want the kind of life where I have all these open questions that bug me,
*  I would say go travel a lot.
*  Well then why do you tell everyone to travel?
*  I want them to have the kinds of lives with a lot of open questions that bug them.
*  But if they're unhappier, don't you think that might make them, bias them against the sorts of openness that you?
*  There's plenty of inertia keeping them from traveling.
*  So I don't feel like I'm misleading them.
*  The behavioral bias is not to travel.
*  So if I nudge them, I feel it's a better world, even though it's maybe not a happier world.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, I think that if you were to buy the idea that, I don't know,
*  happier is just kind of a hard metric because, you know, am I happier if I'm more satisfied or more well-rounded?
*  Like, I'm not really sure.
*  It kind of depends on how that actually takes root.
*  But, you know, at the same time, it's just like many of the things that I've gotten from really productive travel experiences
*  have also been analogous to sorts of experiences when I read very, very good books
*  or like I hear a very, very smart argument or something like that.
*  And those are much like lower cost things to attain.
*  And there are like millions of those versus, you know, I don't know, it's obviously costly.
*  I think in part we travel to read better.
*  If you've been to a lot of places, there are many more things you can read and they make sense to you.
*  If you've hardly been anywhere, so much stuff.
*  Like I went to Kiev in 2019, coincidence.
*  But now when I read about what's happening there, it really does make more sense to me.
*  I don't pretend I figured it out at all.
*  But I would have very little idea without that trip.
*  Well, what do you like? What particularly did you learn?
*  Just like visually understanding what the city looks like?
*  Well, partly that. But when I read, say, well, the Ukrainians have been quite fierce in defending their country.
*  I have an emotionally vivid image that matches up with what I felt when I was there,
*  like how people talked about what they did in 2014 and so on.
*  Just a lot of it makes sense. The geography makes sense.
*  It's religious importance to some of the Russians makes sense. Many things.
*  Well, I feel like this is a particular way about how you travel.
*  I think many people when they travel end up staying within very similar social groups
*  or like even only with Americans or the people they're traveling with
*  and have very little interaction with people and learning about their lives in any kind of meaningful way.
*  I did hang out with an economist there, so maybe I'm not that different.
*  Now you mentioned this idea of men who just can't be happy no matter what.
*  And that brings us we can circle back to the other books as well.
*  But our final book, Richard B. Reeves of Boys and Men, you should do you should do an overview of what this book is about.
*  I'm very bad at overviews as a reader. I'm so selective and focused to me.
*  The main point of this book and to be clear listeners, this is not an overview,
*  but it's simply that for men, a lot of the elasticities are zero.
*  So there's that anecdote about the free college program in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
*  A lot more women go. No more men go. Just zero.
*  So at least for some public policies, the gender split on who responds to it is going to be immense.
*  And I vaguely knew that before, but this book made that clear and vivid to me.
*  That's a big contribution. There's good evidence for that.
*  There's a lot of other different things in the book. But that's my key takeaway. What's yours?
*  So the book kind of starts off with this kind of presentation of an idea where, you know,
*  people have worried in recent decades about the plight of women.
*  And now we need to also add to that the plight of men, modern economies.
*  It kind of relates a bunch of statistics around, you know, college completion rates or how well people,
*  you know, male students do in in academia, but also even in earlier in like kindergarten or throughout
*  their education. And then it kind of provides a few prescriptions.
*  The most, you know, there are a couple ones that are pretty well known by this point,
*  whether it's paid leave for fathers or it's, you know, hiring more male teachers.
*  But the one that's like kind of different is redshirting the boys,
*  which is basically having a presumption of starting boys one year later than girls in kindergarten.
*  And, you know, I find I found the book. I don't know. It's hard because, you know,
*  I was saying this to you before we started this, but, you know, most of the book is trying to convince you
*  that the idea is a very heterodox idea that we should like care about men as well.
*  He addresses most of the time. I mean, Richard Reibs, he's at he's at Brookings.
*  So a lot of his audience is obviously going to be at least center left liberal.
*  And so he spends most of the time he's addressing them and kind of excoriating progressives for having this
*  large blind spot of men. And I don't know, it just feels like this is actually not engaging with a lot of work
*  that's been done to talk about how men suffered or patriarchy.
*  I mean, one of the very, very old feminist critique of patriarchy is that men are going to be harmed just as much,
*  not just as much, but are going to be harmed, even though patriarchy is going to privilege men in many ways.
*  It talks about the fact that men are alienated as fathers. They don't get to have that caring persona,
*  that they're castigated for showing emotions, that these things are going to have real harsh effects on them.
*  Of course, feminism is primarily concerned with the plight of women.
*  But I think that the equivalence there is what's what's not that he's saying that those are, you know,
*  that they're the same level of harm, but that the harm is of similar type feels like incorrect, right?
*  Because the things that were happening with the women's movement are things where there are legal barriers or,
*  you know, physical barriers, barring them from accessing academia or accessing the job market or voting
*  or from even being free and walking around in society.
*  And the things that he's identifying that are barring men are not there are no laws saying that you can't go to college.
*  There's no admissions. Actually, there's affirmative action for men.
*  It's trying to push men into college because otherwise all colleges in the US and much of the West would be female dominated
*  more so than they are already.
*  And so part of me is saying, OK, if we've identified that these two things are actually quite different in kind,
*  then the question is like these responses have to actually engage with the cultural pushes,
*  not just the institutional pushes.
*  And he has this one line very early on, which I find pretty bizarre, where he says conservatives say, you know,
*  men should be more like the old school fathers and progressives just say you should be more like your sisters.
*  And both of these are wrong.
*  But, you know, we tell women all the time and like some of these are good lessons.
*  Like, you know, you should try to salary negotiate. Men do it all the time.
*  We tell and that's like a very productive lesson that a lot of women learn and have like transmitted amongst themselves.
*  And we tell them, be more assertive. Don't in conversation and, you know, don't let people interrupt you.
*  And these are all very important cultural lessons.
*  These aren't like these are norms that have been expressed and have allowed women to do well in the workplace.
*  I mean, even Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg is an entire book of this.
*  But with like in this book, there's no question about like, you know, should men be given lessons as well?
*  Like, hey, like the reason why you're doing better in school at a younger age if you're a girl is usually because
*  you're more willing to sit still. You're able to, you know, sit around and do the work.
*  And, you know, reading is the big place where there's a divergence.
*  He talks about English scores a lot.
*  And there's nothing stopping men from reading, you know.
*  It's like one of those things where I feel like there's like a complete abdication of any kind of idea that there should be some kind of cultural shifts around what you should be telling young boys to do.
*  I don't know Richard Reeves at all.
*  I'm not saying these are his views.
*  When I read a book like this, I can tell you where my mind runs.
*  And maybe there is even some chance he can't say everything he might think.
*  The core message as I read it again, not saying it's his intent, but just men and women are more different than we had thought.
*  And I was already someone who thought men and women were pretty different.
*  So if I pick up that message, he's really saying men and women are pretty different, more at the margin than I had thought.
*  The policy recommendations, whatever one thinks of them, they're sufficiently predictable and anodyne.
*  That there's an alternative reading where even if you think they're fine ideas, you dismiss them a bit.
*  And you wonder if he's not just saying there's not actually a way to solve that problem.
*  To circle back to the other books, especially Ursula Le Guin on the capitalist society of Urras.
*  Men are clearly in charge and dominant and their only men are scientists.
*  And it's a society based perpetually on war somewhere on the globe.
*  And the notion that men do well in societies and relative terms when there's a lot of war and it's better to get rid of war.
*  But when you get rid of war, just a lot of men won't do that well because they're not well suited to that kind of society.
*  That's the alternative reading. That to me is more on the table than arguing about the small.
*  Do we start the many or later? Which I'm not opposed to. I don't know.
*  But just maybe we're just better off shifting into a society where a lot more men do worse.
*  And you know, suck it up and take the net gain of less war.
*  I actually think this is incorrect for a couple of reasons.
*  One is that he makes a comment that I think is meant to fly under the radar very early in the book.
*  Which is that he's only talking about cis heterosexual men.
*  And obviously most studies are only going to focus on that because you don't have high enough numbers.
*  But what's interesting is that there is some research showing that these gaps disappear with gay men.
*  And that on educational fronts they're doing as well as women.
*  And that to me is just like, I mean, obviously there's like questions about, you know, heritability and, you know, the genetics of it.
*  But at the same time, it's like there's like this idea that like men just cannot succeed in the society is also not true.
*  Given that, you know, even within the United, even within the world that we live in from country to country,
*  men are able to be less violent in certain contexts and are more violent in other contexts or, you know, institutions matter clearly.
*  But some classes of men, like there's a distribution.
*  Some need some form of war. Others become Mark Zuckerberg, obviously do incredibly well.
*  There's a kind of sublimation or rechanneling where certain male instincts get put in other directions and these people just have incredible lives.
*  But in terms of the whole distribution, you know, wherever gay men may fall in that, maybe it's the case.
*  Twenty, twenty five percent of men in a society where there aren't that many manufacturing jobs, very few active wars that you might go fight in.
*  Gang warfare is not a thing. I'm not saying that's good for men.
*  It's clearly more destructive than just sitting at home and watching porn or, you know, smoking weed.
*  But nonetheless, there's some cultural vigor from the subset of men that is just sapped and we're not getting back.
*  And I was wondering how much do we need to write that off?
*  I just I'm a strong believer that I mean, obviously there's always going to be outliers.
*  And but like as Reeves mentions multiple times in his book, like even though on average men may experience X or Y or C traits, whatever, there's like remarkable overlap of the genders.
*  There's tons of women who are, quote unquote, more aggressive than men than there are than men and other men are, you know, so or are above the mean for or median for male aggressiveness or things like that.
*  And I think my question is like, yes, maybe there are like tail, you know, tail risks going on.
*  But at the same time, you know, incentives matter a lot.
*  Like the fact that there are a lot of men who are wealthy and white who are able to, you know, escape this, like, quote unquote, masculinity trap just indicates that like there's institutional things that you could do to affect large portions of the population.
*  And I don't know, I largely I found his prescriptions like for what to do at the end, like pretty in a dime.
*  But I found redshirting the boys to be like not very well like thought through in many respects.
*  I don't think he devotes any time to what it would look like to have a class full of 14 year old boys and 13 year old girls or what kind of like dynamics that would create or how that would affect women's educational outcomes.
*  So, again, maybe you're right. And because he doesn't spend much time on that, he's actually more making kind of like a larger cultural message.
*  But I don't know, I think that like we're entering a time and maybe like the through point of all these books, as you mentioned, is just like this question of what is base instinct and what can be actually mediated by political or economic institutions.
*  You know, we're entering a time now where people are like spending a lot of time talking about the heritability of traits and what that means.
*  And, you know, I feel like to become that fatalistic about people would require a lot more action on like very low hanging fruit that we know we haven't done on policy matters.
*  But in Gulliver's travels, of course, we neutralize the destructive tendencies of men by having them do science, even if it's silly, and having them build these dream worlds where you can actually do things that are not so good.
*  Maybe you're actually visiting them, but it's at least the fantasy that you're visiting these dead ancestors and talking with them, which is also in a weird way a little bit like some of the chat GPT models and their offshoots.
*  I think this is a very like low opinion of men that is like being described by.
*  But if you think that's what all these authors are sort of getting at, then it's and that's kind of intractable.
*  It's I don't know.
*  I don't know. Do you agree with Swift about the difficulty of moral progress?
*  That's difficult. I agree that it's difficult. I don't think that I think he's much more pessimistic about it than I am.
*  I mean, given how quick the gains have been in my own lifetime around moral progress.
*  So you're with Steven Pinker, more or less.
*  I don't know. I mean, Pinker, I mean, I think that there have been obviously a lot of economic gains that have been made over the last century.
*  And like, you know, it's very possible to I think that ideas are very, very powerful and that in general that person over time, it really matters if those ideas are true or can be persuasive.
*  And as a, you know, I'm a classical liberal and like I think that like it's true that there's equality across people.
*  And so I think those ideas end up winning out time and again because they're just unsustainable when you set up societies that don't work that way.
*  They'll be beaten by other societies that are more egalitarian and that can take advantage of other people.
*  And so I think moral progress goes along with kind of the economic progress.
*  And those are the inextricably linked. And so you end up beating out other other countries.
*  Maybe moral progress is just feminization of you that male flirted with.
*  Right. Once we give women, if not quite an equal share of influence, a much greater share, they're less inclined to want to fight.
*  That's a good thing. Maybe more risk averse on average, given the destructiveness of war.
*  That's a good thing. But perhaps it's the same process to some extent.
*  And now with birth control, it appears permanent. This higher influence of women.
*  Right. There's not no simple change that's going to reverse it anytime soon.
*  I think it's hard because moral progress and feminism were inextricably linked at a time where there was even more,
*  tons more gender-based violence or things happening in the United States.
*  And so, of course, moral progress had to point in the direction towards more liberation of women in that direction.
*  The idea that it's just that that would be totalizing seems incorrect.
*  It really depends on the structures that are then set up once women are freer.
*  But you can't get around biological sexism in some ways.
*  The fact that women have these costs of the wage gap are largely explained by the cost of having children and what happens after you have kids.
*  People are having fewer and fewer children.
*  But I also think that there's countercultural reactions to that.
*  And then people, I could see having more and more children in response.
*  And so I think it really does depend on what happens with technology around increased freedom from that work.
*  I mean, the idea that we'd have artificial womb seems so far outside of my current technological horizon.
*  But, you know, at some level, being pulled out of the workforce and being in many ways potentially have your health care disabled long term
*  seem like things that are such permanent facts about being a woman right now.
*  If you end up having kids that, you know, it seems hard to get to a level of moral progress where you have kind of like equality of genders there.
*  Just by summing up across all three books, if you think what did we actually learn by reading these, thinking about them, talking about them?
*  How would you put that? Or maybe we don't know yet.
*  I think it's interesting to me because when I think you suggested Gulliver's Travels and I suggested Le Guin.
*  And then you suggested Reeves.
*  Reeves, yeah. And I had not thought about these three as having very many connections before I like sat down and start reading them again.
*  And I think one of the things that's very interesting all the time is we're having the same conversations in so many different contexts over decades, over centuries.
*  And in ways I can, if you're like in a good mood, can feel very unifying, right?
*  You're just like, wow, like I'm just like every other person that's out there.
*  I'm like Jonathan Swift. We're all wrestling with the same questions.
*  Le Guin, all these people, Reeves.
*  But I think it can be very like maybe it's a knock against moral progress that like the same questions are being debated over centuries.
*  It doesn't matter the format. It doesn't matter the, you know, the style.
*  It doesn't matter the background of the interlocutor.
*  It's just like we're just forced into this one kind of circular human condition.
*  So I think it's kind of my large I was surprised by the amount of overlap in themes, honestly.
*  Along those lines, one of my key lessons would be everything is much more connected with other things than you think at first.
*  Even now, I keep on revising that upward as I read more things.
*  The same is true of travel.
*  Going to a lot of different places, you appreciate each one more.
*  You learn something about it by virtue of the fact that you've been to other places, even if it doesn't make you happy.
*  You get this neat form of knowledge.
*  Travel as a form of knowledge as a key theme in Le Guin and Swift comes through to me all the more on these readings.
*  And I feel the lack of that a bit in Reeves.
*  I get that he's writing for which press for Brookings.
*  He works at Brookings.
*  I don't expect him to go off to some distant country and start doing fieldwork.
*  But that's what feels to me is missing.
*  The kind of thing that Alice Evans is doing in her writings on gender, which is going everywhere,
*  trying to learn things in a pretty speculative way that is not exactly a randomized control trial.
*  But I think she's maybe more likely to get somewhere than these smaller investigations.
*  So travel as a mode of knowing has gone up in my eyes.
*  And it's something I think we should talk about, think about, read about, travel about all the more often.
*  I mean, I think it's interesting because on one end,
*  I agree there are sort of like non tangibles that you learn from the sort of the speculative fiction on one hand,
*  also the travel that we're talking about here.
*  But at the same time, if you're trying to affect things in concrete terms, I think, I mean, my opinion Reeves is,
*  I mean, he wrote, I think, article for the Atlantic where the excerpt was just about the one policy prescription of keeping boys back one year.
*  And to me, it's like, you know, I think it's it depends on your theory of changes.
*  Is your theory of change that like sort of whatever you can do to illuminate these broader ideas or truths that you think you've discovered about the world
*  and however you can make those things entertaining and accessible to as many people as possible is how you actually affect long term change?
*  Or is it sort of this like here is a very succinct argument about how you can actually change, you know,
*  a very clear policy problem that I currently have a problem with.
*  And, you know, obviously we want both of those things existing in a society at the same time.
*  But I think it's a very unsettled question about which one of those things gets you further.
*  I agree. But it is striking to me if I go to Singapore or New Zealand and I talk with policy people, usually the first question they ask is, what do other countries do?
*  If you're in America, well, that question might come up.
*  But in policy circles, it's not usually the first question.
*  And certainly at the electoral level, if anything, it might be a negative.
*  So I'd like to see that be a bigger question.
*  I wonder sometimes if it's just about America's so big, we have two neighbors.
*  That's like bizarre. Most countries have like so many neighbors and are much smaller.
*  And so the proximity to them is so much larger that you're used to kind of that spread.
*  And our states kind of function like this, right?
*  Like you see, it's one of the most interesting things that I realized as I do a lot of reporting at the state level and at the local level.
*  And like the amount to which one state taking an action increases the likelihood of its neighbors like engaging with that question is just remarkable to me.
*  Like even if a major like if California does something that's much less impactful to New York than if New Jersey does something or if Massachusetts does something.
*  And so similarly, I think that's like the part of the problem with with with with the U.S. engaging other countries.
*  I mean, at the same time, I've done some infrastructure reporting on the researcher Alan Levy at the American Institute,
*  like very much complains often about how transit authorities don't pay attention to how other countries are building infrastructure much more cheaply than we are, especially in a rapid rail.
*  And it's like it's a problem across sectors. So like the U.S. doesn't look at anyone like if you look at like the UK, they don't look at Spain and Italy,
*  even though they have like lower transportation infrastructure costs, because why would you look at Southern Europe?
*  It's absurd. You get to, you know, Spain and you get to Southern Europe and other areas.
*  They don't look at East Asia. They don't because as a model, even though those places are often much better at building these infrastructure.
*  So it doesn't seem like a uniquely American problem. It just seems like we have fewer neighbors to look at.
*  Jerusalem Dempsey's. Thank you very much. Thank you.
*  Glad to be here.
