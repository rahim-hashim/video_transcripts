# Ada Palmer on Viking Metaphysics, Contingent Moments, and Censorship  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [October 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQZLATAUM3k)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm chatting with Ada Palmer.
*  Ada Palmer is a difficult person to introduce, and in part I wanted to do this episode so
*  I can introduce her better.
*  But let me tell you what I have now.
*  She's the author of an acclaimed four-volume series of science fiction novels known as
*  Terra Ignota.
*  The first and most famous volume is Too Like the Lightning, but that's really just the
*  beginning of what she's about.
*  She is a tenured historian at the University of Chicago in the history department.
*  She studies the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, radical free thought, the history of censorship,
*  information revolutions.
*  Oh, and by the way, her science fiction series was nominated for the Hugo Award for best
*  series in 2022.
*  She composes music as well and participates in performing it.
*  She has a Viking mythology cycle called Sundown, Whispers of Ragnarok.
*  She studies anime and manga, especially Osama Tezuka, post-World War II manga and feminist
*  manga.
*  She consults for anime and manga publishers, blogs at exurbae.com, that's E-X-U-R-B-E.com,
*  at Patreon just by googling Ada Palmer Patreon.
*  There's actually much more, but that's the start for now.
*  Ada, welcome.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  I've been looking forward.
*  Why was living in the Renaissance worse than living during the Middle Ages?
*  This is now, you know, Western and Central Europe.
*  The well and also Southern Europe.
*  So the one word answer is progress, counterintuitively.
*  Because as Europe's economy regenerated after the Black Death and merchants started traveling,
*  farther people started circulating from town to town more, that meant the diseases circulated
*  more quickly.
*  And so the number of deadly diseases that people were exposed to, especially between
*  the ages of two and about 12, skyrocketed.
*  So the death rate for kids between two and 12 went way down.
*  Similarly, there were advances in military technology and in the sizes of cities.
*  There wasn't quite industrialization, but there was a concentration around things like
*  the wool industry.
*  Increased population in cities and more advanced military tech means you can have larger, deadlier
*  wars in which larger populations of people are concentrated in one place and get struck
*  by an army at the same time, while the army is more effective at breaking in through the
*  outside of the city.
*  There'd also been a long and slow process throughout the Middle Ages of what we could
*  call the slow centralization of power.
*  This wasn't yet the absolutist centralized monarchies of the 18th century and Louis XIV,
*  but they were much better at extracting taxes from their periphery than before.
*  Richer kings can afford larger armies and fight more and larger wars.
*  So I like to describe it as the Renaissance is just the Middle Ages only slightly bigger
*  and more so.
*  So all of the same causes of violence and all of the same causes of death that were
*  happening in the Middle Ages were able to happen on a larger scale once we hit 1400.
*  But isn't living in the countryside really boring?
*  And urbanization was occurring because people preferred, or many people preferred, a Renaissance
*  kind of lifestyle with all its risks to a more medieval kind of existence that they
*  could have had if they stayed in the countryside.
*  Yeah, and there were huge reasons for people to flood into the cities.
*  We see cities that get emptied by plague repopulated with enormous speed.
*  When Naples was emptied by a resurgence of the Black Death, Yersinia Pestis in 1494
*  through 1496, this was a city of nearly 200,000.
*  It became completely empty and within 20 years it was over 250,000 again.
*  So people were flooding in for opportunities for economic advancement.
*  You traded shorter life expectancies for all sorts of other things, including better pay
*  and different types of work.
*  One of the things that's fun to remember in the Renaissance is that the actual pay for
*  a day laborer was pretty high.
*  In Renaissance Florence, which is my specialty, one of the things people never expect is that
*  most sort of day laborers, which is the bottom of the economic totem pole in the city, earned
*  enough to live on working three days a week and spent the other several days of the week
*  enjoying themselves and looking at art.
*  This is not what we expect, but it was actually true.
*  Isn't that a sign that living in the Renaissance, at least some parts of it, was better than
*  living in the Middle Ages?
*  Because it's what people showed.
*  So the question is, yeah.
*  So the question is, what do we mean by better?
*  Do we measure better by life expectancy?
*  Do we measure better by how you're spending your days?
*  Do we measure better by, you know, two of your three brothers have died, but you wear
*  comfortable clothing or only one of your three brothers has died, but you're wearing itchy
*  clothing because it's been manufactured only with local materials without being able to
*  import things like alum fixatives and expensive dyes and high quality olive oil from far away
*  in order to make higher quality cloth.
*  This is why when people talk about the Renaissance as a golden age, what I'd like to say is,
*  well, golden age can mean a lot of different things.
*  Do we judge a golden age based on the quality of how beautiful the cities are, how great
*  the art is that is being produced, how many consumer goods somebody is living with in
*  a daily life, the quality of your clothing, or do we measure it by life expectancy?
*  Do we measure it by fear?
*  Do we measure it by how many times you have relatives who are on death's door from being
*  exposed to the plague and living from it?
*  We've all experienced during post 2020, those moments when a friend would say, oh no, I
*  got exposed.
*  And we have that little palpitation of anxiety waiting for the result of the COVID test.
*  We have letters from Machiavelli and his brother back and forth.
*  Oh no, I got exposed to somebody who had the Black Death.
*  Now we have to wait two days to see whether I got it.
*  Those factors of fear.
*  So the answer is the Renaissance is a really complicated and sort of high extremes and
*  low troughs place to live in which a lot of the things that had been true in the Middle
*  Ages became more extreme in both positive and negative ways.
*  There's so much wonderful art from the Florentine Renaissance, as you quite well know.
*  If you had to try to explain that with as few dimensions as possible in the explanation,
*  why did that happen?
*  When and where it did?
*  So two reasons, and I'm going to give the post Renaissance one first.
*  Because Florence came to be a center of the Renaissance and especially in the 18th and
*  19th centuries came to be a center of the grand tour and a place that everyone always
*  had to go visit during the formation of an upper class education for the populations
*  that are reading Sherlock Holmes live when it comes out.
*  Florence has always been greatly respected and therefore protected.
*  And whenever Florence has been in danger from something, those dangers have pulled back.
*  Even during World War II, for example, both Axis and allies were under strict orders never
*  to damage the artistic legacy in Florence, even as they were allowed to bomb the heck
*  out of Milan and its historic center, Genoa and its historic center, Naples and its historic
*  center.
*  So one of the reasons Florence seems to have so much more art than everywhere else is that
*  more of it has survived, which is a decision made by the later centuries by valuing Florence
*  in a unique way.
*  Venice being its rival in that degree of affection.
*  As for why the art got there in the first place, the short answer is that it's a defense
*  mechanism.
*  So remember Renaissance Italy is a bunch of little tiny city states, each of them its
*  own country.
*  They all hate their neighbors and are facing constant small scale warfare like the wars
*  between Florence and Pisa, between Florence and Siena.
*  And meanwhile, outside of Italy, there are these large, ambitious centralized powers,
*  the Kingdom of France, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Ottoman Empire, the what we call Holy
*  Roman Empire.
*  They would just say Empire to the north that want to conquer things because it brings in
*  income and it results in a claim for the monarch.
*  Remember those very telling lines in Henry IV part two, where young Henry V is advised
*  by his father, busy minds with foreign wars, achieve peace at home by sending our ambitious
*  noblemen to other places to fight wars.
*  Italy was the place he went to fight wars.
*  Italy was the economic center of medieval and Renaissance Europe because it was, you
*  know, we talk about big tech, big pharma and big oil, right?
*  But in the Renaissance, it was big wool, big olive oil and big finances and internal
*  thing.
*  But Italy was the center for banking.
*  It was the center for cloth production, which was the economic equivalent of the auto industry,
*  giant industry.
*  And it was also the center for the export of olive oil, which was not only a food stuff
*  at the time, but an industrial product necessary for a lot of production.
*  And it was what you burned for light a lot of the time in oil lamps.
*  So these tiny Italian city states were richer than the large kingdoms outside of them.
*  They had smaller populations.
*  They struggled to raise armies because they didn't have enough people.
*  They had to hire foreign armies to defend them.
*  And yet they were full of the richest families on earth who literally had mountains of gold
*  piled in their basements.
*  If you're a king and you want to conquer something, do you want to go for anything else or do
*  you want to go for a small, friendless Italian city state with piles of gold in the basement?
*  But how does art protect them?
*  How does that explain wonderful art in Florence?
*  So imagine for a moment that you are the French ambassador and you're on your way to Rome
*  to meet with the pope because the French king always needs this.
*  Now, if you're an ambassador, you're at minimum the son of a count because only aristocracy
*  can be ambassadors.
*  And on your way south, you're stopping off in different cities on the way, including
*  Florence.
*  Now you already have a terrible opinion of Florence because Florence is a pit of merchant
*  scum and villainy.
*  Florence in order to prevent noblemen from taking over the Republic, literally executed
*  everyone in the city who had a drop of royal blood or noble blood.
*  So it's just commoners.
*  There's not a single person in this city who is of sufficient rank to be worthy to talk
*  to you.
*  In addition, Florence has such a terrible reputation for sodomy, homosexuality, and
*  perversion that the verb to Florentine is literally the word for anal sex in five different
*  European countries, including in France.
*  So you're on your way to this city and it's full of merchant scum and they're all perverts
*  and there isn't even anyone there willing to, who's worthy to host you on the way.
*  So you're going to stay with your dad's banker because he's the only Florentine who's a
*  dress you've got.
*  You show up in the city and you reach the city and suddenly, wait a minute, it's full
*  of these gorgeous ancient Roman bronzes.
*  Wait a minute, they can't be ancient Roman bronzes.
*  They look like they're new, but that technology doesn't exist.
*  That technology was lost centuries ago.
*  And then you go to the banker's house and he greets you humbly at the door saying, I'm
*  sorry, my house is unworthy to host your excellency.
*  And he invites you inside and you look around the courtyard and it's like nothing you've
*  ever seen before with these round circular arches that let enormous amounts of light
*  shine in on the gardens and the statues.
*  You've never seen this before.
*  Wait, you have seen this before.
*  It looks like the ruins of the Roman villa in the backyard of your father's castle where
*  you grew up, but that doesn't exist anymore.
*  Those arts were lost.
*  And in the middle of the courtyard, there's a gorgeous statue, an ancient Roman statue
*  of a Bacchus or Dionysius.
*  And next to it, there's a brand new statue that's obviously new because it hasn't even
*  turned green yet.
*  The bronze is still ruddy, but that technology, you know, doesn't exist.
*  And in the corner, there are some men dressed in strange robes speaking a language you've
*  never heard.
*  And you say, what language are they speaking?
*  And the banker says, oh, they're speaking ancient Greek.
*  They're Plato scholars.
*  And you say, but ancient Greek is lost and Plato is lost.
*  How do you have this?
*  Oh, we have lots of ancient Greek here.
*  Here's my grandson Lorenzo.
*  He's just written a sonnet in ancient Greek about the three parts of the soul.
*  And then here's a little boy reciting a sonnet to you about the nature of the soul in ancient
*  Greek.
*  And you're like, where am I?
*  All of this stuff is impossible.
*  And that's the moment that your host, Cosimo de' Medici, turns to you and says, would France
*  like to make an alliance with Florence?
*  And you could say no, right?
*  You could say no, we're going to come here.
*  We're going to bring our army.
*  We're going to mop the floor with you because you're helpless compared to our giant forces.
*  And we're going to burn this down and take the gold.
*  And all of this will be gone and we'll be rich.
*  Or you could say, yes, let's make an alliance.
*  Send me a bronze smith and an architect and a Greek tutor and a Plato scholar.
*  And we're going to bring them to the court in France.
*  And the king is going to do his court like this.
*  And then when the envoys from England show up, they're going to feel like uncultured
*  country bumpkins, just like I feel now.
*  That's how it's a defense mechanism, because they are helpless on the military game, but
*  they are so ahead on the culture game that you don't want to hurt them.
*  You want to befriend them so that you can have the art.
*  Let's say you have the choice to be sent back in time to any historical era.
*  You're given whatever languages you need and a guarantee of health.
*  Don't send me back in time.
*  Back is terrible.
*  Send me forward.
*  No, no, forward might be terrible, too.
*  Your health is guaranteed.
*  Where do you choose to go for one year?
*  Can I go back to last year?
*  No, seriously, the further back in time you go, the worse it is.
*  And it's funny, I had a conversation like this at the Renaissance Society of America
*  conference a few years ago, sitting down at a table of four historians and six art
*  historians. And we asked the question, if you could go back to our period, our period
*  that we know best, if you could go back in time, would you?
*  And all the art historians said yes, and all the historians said no, because we study the
*  violent side and the nasty side.
*  And, you know, as much as I respect and love the historical figures I know, all of their
*  general comportment and their attitudes toward outsiders, their xenophobia, their attitudes
*  toward women, it would be a really miserable experience to be there.
*  Now, let's imagine that we can set me up so that not only is my health guaranteed, but
*  they're going to believe I'm local.
*  They're not going to think that I'm a foreigner.
*  They're somehow going to have a fake family and I'm going to have a perfect accent and
*  I can have letters of introduction because if you're a foreigner, you're you're you're
*  suck. Oh, none.
*  I would want to be Dominican.
*  Right, you've read Diderot on none, so you're a none.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Dominican would be best for many periods.
*  It depends on the goal.
*  If it's I want to live and be okay, I want to be as close to the present as possible.
*  If it's I love these people and I want to meet them and get to know about them, I either
*  want to go to a dinner party at Diderot's house or I want to talk to Machiavelli, you
*  know, late in his life about the importance of his work after he's written The Prince.
*  If I want to do the most good because I'm actually changing history, then I need to
*  go back to classic class, pre classical Egypt and teach Imhotep, the germ germ theory of
*  disease and hand washing practices because he is the earliest medical authority who has
*  the correct background to be able to understand the germ theory of disease and the correct
*  degree of authority to be able to teach to people.
*  If you want to actually increase the number of people who have lived by billions, you
*  want to teach hand washing to Imhotep.
*  Is history just a kind of clutter?
*  And is clutter underrated?
*  Clutter is definitely underrated.
*  I think the problem with is history just a kind of clutter is the just because what is
*  clutter if not a record of the human beings who have been in a place and used it and lived
*  it and all of the delightful experiences.
*  I don't know how often you've been decluttering a room and picked up an object and thought,
*  oh, yeah, that wonderful day I spent with a friend or that frustrating day that then
*  got better in a particular way or even that frustrating day that didn't get better.
*  But now I have the perspective from which to digest my frustrations.
*  There's no, I do declutter rooms.
*  Maybe that's my problem.
*  Is that wonderful saying history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme?
*  That when we look at the past and have reminders of it and go through its layers to understand
*  and have empathy with the past, whether it's empathy with yourself of 10 years ago, whether
*  you when you made a decision that you later regretted or empathy with somebody 200 years
*  ago and they made a decision that you struggle to understand, empathy is vital to our ability
*  to work with each other, to forgive the past, to understand how it really was trying to do
*  its best when it set up the world we have and how our efforts to do our best in setting up the
*  future are in no way ethically superior to the efforts of our predecessors.
*  We know more, which is great.
*  We can do more, which is great.
*  That's been true of every generation for a long time.
*  We have to understand and look at the reasons that people in the past made their mistakes
*  in order to be able to not do similar ones.
*  And we need to go through the clutter to learn all that.
*  Which method of doing history is currently the most under practiced and underrated?
*  So you might have said a while ago, well, material culture, maybe that's not true anymore.
*  Weirdly right now, weirdly right now, I would say that one of the most undervalued is biography.
*  Unfortunately, partly because biography was a very fashionable genre in the 19th century,
*  very early 20th century.
*  And so as a reaction against it's been pushed away, but also because
*  biography is one of few arenas of history in which you can make a living actually writing
*  biographies and people will buy them in Barnes and Noble Recreation and later read.
*  They're one of the things you can live on.
*  That means that especially in the middle of the 20th century, they were and still are
*  disproportionately written by women because more women don't manage to make a living within the
*  academic world than men.
*  And so biography has come to be an almost gendered practice of history associated with
*  those women who got pushed out of the academy and are trying to support themselves as scholars
*  independently.
*  That has meant that there's been a move away from respecting biography as a practice.
*  But one of the really powerful things biography does is cut across moments when we draw a line.
*  Right?
*  We talk a lot about when does the Renaissance end in the Baroque period begin?
*  When does the Middle Ages end and another thing begin?
*  And then you do a biography of somebody like Titian who lives into his 90s and he realized
*  there was no line.
*  He lived through three different places where we would draw a line.
*  And we often forget that people who lived through one thing are still alive for the next unless we
*  approach them beginning to end through the art of biography.
*  Whose biography will you write?
*  I'm thinking of doing a choose your own adventure biography of Machiavelli in which you get to
*  different moments in his life when he made an important decision.
*  And then I speculate what would have happened if he'd done something different to show how wildly
*  improbable it was that we got the prince and how different humanity might have ended up if we
*  hadn't.
*  That one would be fun.
*  I've also thought about a choose your own adventure book biography of Voltaire because there's
*  that amazing moment when he's barely in his early 20s and his father almost decides to arrange for
*  him to be banished to South America.
*  And imagine the world where instead of Voltaire being in France, Voltaire is in South America.
*  Both how different France would be and how different South America would be.
*  I love bringing people to think about those contingent moments when a tiny decision made by
*  somebody often unfamous, right?
*  Voltaire's father is not famous the way Voltaire is.
*  Nonetheless, shapes enormous amounts of what comes after.
*  Those moments are what remind us that we are also powerful and that every single one of us shapes
*  history, not just the people whose names are a newspaper headline.
*  How do we know what Old Norse music was like?
*  We have a couple of recorded songs written and we also have written descriptions and sagas and we
*  have archaeological finds including flutes.
*  We have references to drums, but drums almost never survive.
*  Drums and harps are very difficult to preserve over time because the tension on the object
*  weakens the structure and makes them decay quickly.
*  But we know, for example, what notes and how many notes a Viking flute could make.
*  And we have various other written descriptions.
*  What is it that women scholars understand better about Viking metaphysics?
*  It's not just it's not mainly the women's goes to understand it, but it was the entry of women
*  scholars into the field that helped us understand it.
*  For a long time in Viking studies, nobody wanted to touch metaphysics with a 10 foot pole.
*  This was because during World War II, Hitler's minister of culture was somebody who had done
*  his dissertation on Viking metaphysics.
*  And you couldn't work on Viking metaphysics without citing him.
*  So it made it a sort of a poisoned field for a while.
*  However, when in the late 60s and 70s, the advances of feminism meant that more women
*  were entering academia, but still often being sidelined within academia and pushed into
*  corners of research that others didn't want to touch.
*  A number of them started looking at topics that people hadn't looked at in a long time,
*  including that one, especially because Viking metaphysics revolves around weaving.
*  Now, weaving is a feminine coded, feminine gendered subject, both in the Viking period
*  and in the period when history took its formation in the 20th and 21st centuries.
*  Lots of weaving related equipment had been found in tombs and excavated here and there.
*  And then sort of set aside as this is women's work and not of interest except to women.
*  Women started looking at it and were like, wait a minute, this isn't a weaving
*  shuttle, this is a staff of sorcery as described in the sagas that very clearly describe these
*  staffs of sorcery that look like weaving shuttles because Viking metaphysics is dominated by ideas
*  of threads of fate, the norm spinning fate, weaving fate, et cetera.
*  And it was women who were first willing to look at that stuff in detail.
*  Why is Diderot's Jacques the Fatalist an interesting work?
*  Lots of reasons.
*  So Jacques the Fatalist is among other things an exercise in getting you to realize that there is
*  less in the author-reader contract than you think. When you pick up a book, especially something that
*  promises to be a novel, you have certain expectations. There will be an arc that,
*  you know, factors will be introduced, they will develop towards some sort of climax or crisis or
*  suspense. There will be a climax, there will be a denouement, characters will be introduced,
*  those characters will affect the protagonist's paths through it, they will have a complete
*  sort of character development arc from beginning to end, all of these other expectations.
*  Diderot Jacques the Fatalist reminds us that there's only one contract between the author
*  and the reader truly, which is when you finish each sentence, you will want to read the subsequent
*  sentence. So long as the author keeps that promise, the text succeeds in getting you to enjoy the path
*  from one end to the other. Diderot is therefore absolutely infuriating and does brilliant,
*  ridiculous things like a point at which the two characters go to bed and he says,
*  while we're waiting for them to wake up, I'm going to tell you a completely unrelated story
*  and starts telling you a completely unrelated story. You say, Diderot, you're the one who's
*  putting them to sleep, you can wake them up at any moment, why are you doing this? He's playing
*  around with the structure of a novel, all of which is a complicated attempt to portray an atheistic
*  cosmos. Because in the 18th century, one dominant way of thinking about providence and of a
*  intelligent designer, whether one thinks of that in a deist or a Christian or other monotheistic
*  context, is as the author of the world, the author of the great scroll, as Diderot often puts it,
*  who sends players out into the world to enact their deeds, to journey through the world. This
*  is very much what Voltaire depicts in Candide, which is full of contrived and improbable reunions
*  and encounters that clearly serve to teach us a moral lesson, the heavy hand of the author palpable
*  as the background of providence. This is a very common way of thinking in Diderot's 18th century.
*  But Diderot thought, wait a minute, when you look around the world, you meet lots of random people
*  and they don't have character arcs and they don't show up again later. There's no particular moral
*  lesson you got from chatting with that person who is sitting next to you in the wagon or in our case
*  on the airplane. It just sort of happened and sometimes things get interrupted and you never
*  find out what happened at the end. You might see a funeral go by and never find out whose funeral
*  that was. Doesn't that feel to you like chaos? He's trying to write a book that feels as if it
*  is taking place in a world that has no author. If most books take place in a world with an author.
*  The notion that the more people keep on talking, the more it is they end up talking about sex.
*  Only in the middle. It moves rapidly away from that. I know that that's the interpretation that
*  Will and Ariel Durant take to it in their examination of what they call the age of Voltaire.
*  But you know, Diderot does zoom in on sexuality a little bit in the middle, especially in the long
*  story they listen to at the inn. But he begins with these, you know, who are they, what are they
*  made of? Well, they're made of atoms and the atoms are currently these people but they're going to
*  fade away again. And that theme comes back more persistently than the sexuality. Diderot has
*  other work that's about sexuality. He has a lot of discussions of sexuality in Rémo's Nephew. He of
*  course famously went to the Bastille for writing The Nun, which is a pornographic lesbian novel
*  about nuns. But Jacques the Fatalist, while it has sexuality in it, he's more interested in sexuality
*  as a thing which is very, very natural and yet very, very taboo. In the 18th century, he's very
*  interested in this question of are we to guide ourselves by laws of nature that we deduce from
*  observing nature the way John Locke and Thomas Hobbes recommended? If so, doesn't nature tell us
*  that sex and sexual reproduction is one of the biggest parts of life? Why is it silenced by our
*  culture? Is our culture irrational in its behavior toward this? The sex is a tool for getting at
*  questions of what is natural or unnatural rather than the end, if that makes sense.
*  But Diderot's fascination with sex as a social phenomenon and yours, how does that tie the two
*  of you together as thinkers? I mean, I think both of us are very interested in not just sexuality
*  but also gender and how an enormous amount that is artificial, a nervous amount that is culturally
*  contingent or culturally invented, an enormous amount that's even performative, surround
*  performances of sexuality and performances of gender. In Terra Econota, for example, there's
*  people who are living in a largely genderless future in which only gender-neutral language is
*  used and people are not intended to publicly acknowledge gender, nonetheless are sexually
*  excited by gender because of its taboos, not because I'm presenting gender as something that
*  is biologically ingrained or innate, but because our society has spent literal thousands of years
*  developing complex ways to perform gender in not only language but in clothing, in physicality,
*  in comportment, in patterns of inflection, in how we walk, which are performed differently
*  in different societies. And the adoption of genderless language isn't by itself going to
*  mean that people abandon this ancient vocabulary of performance. It's fascinating to look at
*  the redeployment and transformation over time of so sophisticated a cultural construction
*  as gender. And I think both Diderot and I are interested in that in as much as it gets to the
*  edges of what is biology versus what is culture and how 90% of it is culture.
*  De Sade, where does that come from? What are the influences on de Sade as a writer?
*  Thomas Aquinas, now lots and lots of things, but he's very interested in the large philosophical
*  milieu in the period. Remember that the 18th century is a moment when the clandestine bookshop
*  is a major, major thing. And if anyone enjoys and is interested in the history of censorship
*  and clandestine publishing, I can't recommend enough the work of Robert Darnton, a brilliant,
*  brilliant historian of clandestine literature. But the same underground bookshops sell all
*  underground materials, which means an underground bookshop sells pornography and it also sells
*  Voltaire and Rousseau and it also sells diatribes criticizing the king. And it also sells radical
*  Jansenist theological pamphlets about whether the Holy Spirit derives from the Father and Son
*  equally or from the Father alone. The same kinds of people frequent these shops and the same kinds
*  of people buy things. So think about how when you go into a Barnes and Noble, the science fiction
*  and fantasy section is one section, even though science fiction and fantasy are different things,
*  but they have a lot of overlap, both in the overlap of readership and an overlap in books
*  that have both science fiction and fantasy elements. It was perfectly natural in the same
*  way for clandestine bookshops to generate these works that are pornography and radical philosophy
*  at the same time. They're printed by the same printers, sold to the same audiences and circulate
*  in the same places. de Sade uses his extreme pornography to get at questions of morality,
*  ethics, and artificiality. What are the ethics of hurting each other? Why do we feel that way about
*  hurting each other? What are so-called natural impulses as John Locke and Hobbes were very
*  dominant at the time? Or Descartes, who is differently dominant at the time in rivalry with
*  them. They make claims about the natural human impulses or the natural character of a human being.
*  What does extreme sexuality show us about how that character might be broader than it is?
*  And I mean it when I say Thomas Aquinas, right? So one of Thomas Aquinas's traditional proofs of the
*  existence of God is that everything he sees around him in nature, this also is one that Aristotle
*  uses but Aquinas articulates it in the most famous way for de Sade's period, that when we look around
*  us it's clear that everything is designed to work. Forest animals have forest camouflage, desert
*  animals have desert camouflage. Woodpeckers that eat grubs have a beak shaped correctly to be able
*  to get grubs. Clearly, therefore, an intelligence designed everything to fit where it needs to fit
*  so that carnivores have carnivore teeth and herbivores have herbivore teeth. Yes, says Thomas
*  Hobbes quoting all this and says, and furthermore, the penis is round and the anus is round. So
*  clearly God designed the penis to fit into the anus and not into the vagina, which is a long thin
*  shape. He's playing with the question of why we believe these century or in that case millennium
*  old arguments about what is and isn't natural and inviting us to re-examine questions like, well,
*  what that a woodpecker needs does it have? What that a woodpecker needs does it not have? Because
*  it doesn't have fingers within which to disentangle its legs from a thread if it gets tangled up.
*  In that way, Sade is using pornography to open the questions that Darwin will later answer.
*  If Descartes had truly let loose, what would we have received?
*  Oh, if he hadn't been scared off by the Galileo condemnation, I think we would have received a
*  much more deist version of what ends up being a very Catholic set of ideas about ontology and
*  physics. So Descartes was in the middle of publishing one of his big treatises when he
*  heard news of the Galileo trials conclusion and of the Galileo condemnation. And he actually
*  withdrew that text from his publisher and then spent several years revising it to be more
*  carefully orthodox. And I think it would have been a much more deist, still theist, but much
*  more deist, we can't know things with certainty except what we deduce from nature kind of text.
*  Greater in alignment, therefore, with what we see in our Enlightenment figures like
*  Voltaire and Rousseau. And for that reason, I think that if Descartes, who becomes dominant in France
*  a bit before the rise of Voltaire and Rousseau, had been more expressly deist, we would have seen
*  less association between deism and Newtonian physics. But we get deism associated with
*  Newtonian physics during the Enlightenment because it's the same people who are deists who are
*  sympathetic to importing Bacon's scientific method and Newtonian physics into France.
*  A simplified version of that answer, therefore, being the impact of Descartes' treatise being
*  more deist, would have been an Enlightenment in which France didn't split into the
*  France being more interested in logic and this new imported perceived as foreign and British thing
*  being more interested in empiricism and the scientific method. And the two would have been
*  seen as more compatible with each other. Probably we would have therefore seen even more scientific
*  laboratories develop in France in that period, as opposed to the centers of material and
*  experimental science settling in England, Scotland and Italy. Was there an Irish Enlightenment?
*  Yes, definitely, but to a lesser extent simply because Ireland was being so smashed and damaged
*  by the warfare and so on with England, especially recovering from wars of the 17th century, as well
*  as what was happening in the 18th. And whenever a polity is in extremis, it has a bit less of a
*  robust opportunity to raise the intellectuals that are necessary to have a leading position.
*  So what have you been-
*  You have Berkeley, you have Swift, a bit later you have Burke.
*  Yeah.
*  That's pretty impressive for what's a fairly small country.
*  It is. I would say that a part of that is
*  those are excellent figures and they were embraced by and are famous in the Anglophone
*  scientific tradition. But there are certainly two dozen equally innovative and important people
*  from Spain or Italy in the same moment, if not more, who aren't famous in the Anglophone
*  histories of science because we center the nationalistically celebrated British Isles
*  area more, if that makes sense.
*  Sure. Who actually made the censorship decisions during the French Enlightenment?
*  Fresh out of college English majors.
*  Because-
*  The bureaucracy, it's the ruler, it's the clergy. What's the actual mechanism? Whose decision is it?
*  So there are two levels because France and the King of France by the Enlightenment is
*  sufficiently powerful that even though this is a Catholic country and technically
*  the last word in censorship is the Inquisition and the Pope,
*  France manages to get Italy to agree for France to have this be delegated to a bureaucracy under
*  the King. And that bureaucracy is obliged to enforce any rule that the Pope and the Central
*  Roman Inquisition make, but it hires its own staff and they are genuinely more concerned
*  with questions like whether things are criticizing the King than they are with questions of theology.
*  Many of them, this is a first job out of college for a lit major. And many of them, this is well
*  documented in the work of Robert Darnton, many of them are themselves aspiring authors and aspiring
*  professors. And we have letters from French censors back and forth, oh Jacques, I got your
*  book to censor, don't worry, I'll do a really good job. And they therefore are actually very
*  sympathetic to the radical ideas that are circulating because they are fresh out of
*  college intelligentsia and we're also excited by these new ideas. They tend to let through a lot
*  of things. Now often later, Rome will examine the materials if the materials become famous and will
*  ban them then. This is why, for example, Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopédie is approved by the
*  French censors but banned by the Pope as of volume seven, I think it is, the letter H.
*  And at that point, Rome catches up with France and says, you must ban this thing, we command it. And
*  under this command, the copies that are public in Paris are confiscated. Paris is required to hold
*  a public burning of the Encyclopédie. They march the copy up to the pot spot. They then set it aside
*  and don't burn it. Instead, burn djent's in his treatises about the nature of the Trinity,
*  which is what France actually is afraid of at the time. So there's a lot of layers and permeability.
*  And while the Pope had ultimate authority in some ways to say, no, you may not have this,
*  that is only several years slower than the short-term bureaucracy which is run by lit majors,
*  overseen by people who answer to the king, much more concerned about political and local questions
*  than about abstract scientific or theological ones, and also happy to let people smuggle things
*  through, which is why even after the banning of the Encyclopédie, if you're in Geneva and you're
*  printing something really bad like de Sade or djent's in his treatises about the nature of the
*  Trinity, you smuggle them into France by wrapping them in copies of the Encyclopédie. Because if
*  you're intercepted at the border, they open up the secret trunk under your wagon and say, oh,
*  it's just the Encyclopédie, pay me a small bribe and I'll let it through. And you pay a small bribe
*  and they let it through. The banned book providing cover for an even more banned book.
*  LARSON What do you take to have been the actual goals of the Spanish Inquisition?
*  FRIES The Spanish Inquisition is a very separate thing from the other inquisitions that I work on
*  in other regions. And I like to avoid using the word inquisition ever in the singular, because it
*  creates the illusion that there was an actual unified or it doesn't create, it perpetrates the
*  intentional illusion that there was a central unified decision making. The Catholic Church
*  wanted to seem more unified than it was. But in periods when it took six months or more for a
*  message to get to Rome from one of the Spanish colonies in the New World, for example, these are
*  local authorities making local decisions in the name of Rome and Rome struggling to catch up.
*  To the degree that Rome even printed a manual to guide inquisitors on how to respond if people
*  came to them talking about books that have been banned in Spain that they've never heard of being
*  banned elsewhere and how to sort of fake it and pretend that, yes, Rome totally knew that you banned
*  this. Yes, it was a very good idea to ban it. So the inquisition is a blunt instrument and
*  usually a tool of local power. It isn't a government. We often think of the inquisition
*  as the government, but it's more a non-government body that reaches internationally. Think about
*  UNICEF or Doctors Without Borders. And it has the infrastructure to go from place to place.
*  Now think about that operating locally and having agents that are good at crossing borders but depend
*  on the local government for collaboration and economic support. And in the case of the inquisition,
*  it doesn't own its own prisons. It doesn't have its own police. It has to borrow them locally. So
*  what does the local authority want to persecute? That's what the inquisition will end up persecuting.
*  In Ferdinand and Isabella's Spain and that of their successors, they were incredibly anxious about
*  the imagined treacherous fifth column of descendants of converted Jews and converted Muslims.
*  And so they lavished money on their inquisition to encourage their inquisition to advance the
*  mass persecution of what they perceived as a local threat to their crown. This had nothing to do with
*  the practices of the inquisition that were going on at the same time in Italy or in France or in
*  in even Spanish controlled territories. So for example, or Portuguese controlled territories.
*  So for example, in Goa on the west coast of India in the 17th century, the orders given by the
*  inquisition were to destroy all texts in indigenous languages and try to wipe out indigenous languages
*  and indigenous knowledge. At the same time, the inquisition in what is now Mexico City was
*  ferociously devoting itself to developing indigenous dictionaries and translating materials
*  into indigenous languages because it decided that the best way to proselytize was through translation.
*  These are the decisions being made by local authorities to try to seek power. Zooming out,
*  however, the biggest pattern in all of them is that the biggest, the most common form of censorship
*  is self-censorship, but the majority of self-censorship is intentionally cultivated by an
*  outside power. The inquisition more broadly, especially the Roman inquisition, spends a lot
*  more of its time trying to scare people into not writing books than it does trying to destroy books
*  that are actually there. If you think about the goal being to silence Galileo, the way to silence
*  Galileo is not to make Galileo world famous by having a giant splashy trial of Galileo. The way
*  to make Galileo silent is to quietly poison Galileo, right? This is Renaissance Italy. We
*  are very good at quietly poisoning people. This is a solved problem. If you want to silence a man,
*  you silence a man. You do not put him on a big show trial, but what they want to do is silence
*  Descartes, and dozens of others who saw what happened to Galileo were scared and therefore
*  never wrote the treatises that they otherwise would have. Censorship intends to cause and stimulate
*  self-censorship. That is a pattern we see broadly, whether in the inquisition, whether in the Middle
*  Ages before there was an inquisition, or whether today in China with the extremely intentionally
*  unpredictable enforcement of when they arrest a blogger, for example, which they do with very
*  little pattern to make it harder to predict whether you are in danger to make people more
*  scared that they might be in danger to again incur self-censorship. Why is it politically dangerous
*  to censor pornography? It's politically dangerous to censor pornography because
*  censorship is a very blunt instrument, and we must always imagine how a tool we set up to censor
*  something will be used in the future by bad actors we disagree with. If you create a tool capable of
*  censoring something, it will still exist and still be there later when people want to censor something
*  different. Pornography is usually where major battles over censorship are fought these days
*  because people don't want to defend it. It's icky and gross and a lot of people don't want it or do
*  want it but don't want to publicly say so, don't want to be associated with it. So a lot of people
*  are willing to say, okay fine, censor this, but then you create the apparatus to censor this,
*  and the next stage is someone saying, oh well, you know, this other book, clearly this is basically
*  the same as pornography because it depicts a same-sex couple, let's censor that using the same
*  infrastructure you've just created. Almost all censorship isn't carried out by creating a new
*  institution to do it, but by repurposing an old institution that's already there, and new things
*  will be censored using old tools so that, you know, when talkies came in, people were very anxious
*  that there could suddenly be bad words in movies, and all over the place, New Zealand, Australia,
*  the U.S., new methods were set up for censoring movies to make sure bad words weren't used. Well,
*  those are the same methods that were then used to censor discussions of communism during the Red
*  Scare and that were used to persecute free thinking and socialist authors, the same apparatus that got
*  created for the censorship of a bad word. Once we make it, it exists, and it's very hard to dismantle
*  it, so don't let the fact that we don't care about pornography enable people to create tools they
*  will use to censor other things in future. Do you agree with the common claim, which seems supported
*  by some poll evidence, that American women are less supportive of free speech than American men?
*  Huh. I'm not familiar with that question, although I am familiar with the fact that
*  internationally, when we look at things like the movements for women getting the vote in some of
*  the theocratic Arab countries, when women got the vote, they disproportionately voted for the very
*  religious and conservative parties. So that I think that there is a slight preponderance of women
*  who end up supporting religious fringe movements, but there's also a whole lot of other ways in which
*  women tend liberal, especially within the U.S. So I think that's a very complex question that I haven't
*  thought about, I should. If we think about why so few of the great books discuss menstruation,
*  is that censorship, or do we understand that some other way? It's taboo, which is in some ways a kind
*  of censorship. It's people being uncomfortable discussing a topic. I always make a point of
*  bringing up menstruation when it's relevant in my classroom, when I'm describing to students
*  what it was like experiencing the fall of the Roman Empire, and that suddenly there's no one keeping
*  peace on the roads and there are bandits on the streets, and it means that you can't get, you know,
*  imported high quality non-itchy wool, and you can't get good olive oil, you can only get local olive
*  oil, and you can't get fish sauce. I always mention, and you can't get sponges, the sea sponges,
*  which are what women would use as maxi pads in the period, and now you can't get maxi pads,
*  and you just have to shove a bunch of rags up there. And it's always delightful to see the sort
*  of stunned look on the face of most of the boys in the class, and the sort of delighted look on the
*  face of many of the girls in the class of, yeah, people in the past menstruated too. This is a
*  real legitimate thing. But I would say it is a taboo, and a taboo is a kind of censorship,
*  because censorship isn't exclusively state actors or organized actors. There's a lot of
*  bottom-up grassroots censorship as well, and taboos are part of that.
*  Why do we think of velvet as the cloth of the Renaissance?
*  I think more of brocade is the cloth of the Renaissance, but certainly there were major
*  technological advances in velvet production and a number of other very high-end fabric production
*  in the Renaissance. It's actually quite clear from recent examinations of sketches of
*  machines like those of Brunelleschi that they pretty much did figure out how to make industrial
*  mass production looms. They could have switched over to making cheap cloth at enormous volume,
*  the way we did in the 19th century, but that wasn't what the Renaissance did or wanted.
*  The Renaissance wanted super high-end cloth. And when you compare the actual costs of fabric,
*  buying a suit of very nice clothing made out of good quality Florentine brocade with velvet trim
*  cost as much as buying a luxury sports car. And you have one outfit or two outfits,
*  you have your Sunday outfit and your regular one, and you wear them all year, and then you get the
*  next year's fashions. And a huge part of the purpose of it is to display social status by showing
*  the high-end things. So we associate with Renaissance affluence and the Renaissance's
*  biggest industry, the one that's the equivalent of the auto industry, the development of these
*  extremely high-end luxury things that you then show off on your person every day.
*  What is it about Renaissance annotations of Lucretius that's more interesting than Lucretius
*  himself? What do they add? They tell us what the moment of first contact was like between
*  people in the Renaissance who had vague and often over-the-top mythologized ideas of what
*  ancient Rome was like, and then the real ideas of Epicureanism preserved from antiquity.
*  In the Middle Ages, they had very little knowledge of Epicureanism, though they knew that it was
*  something. It was mentioned by medieval authorities like Lactantius. It was discussed in Bits of
*  Cicero that they had, but they didn't actually have Epicureanism. They just knew there had been
*  this philosophical movement that said that happiness was the highest good and that the world was made
*  of atoms. So they have high and exciting expectations of this work, and then they finally get a hold of
*  it, and as they make comments in the margin, we see their moment of first contact. We see which pieces
*  in a long and complicated text stood out to them and which pieces didn't. We see how they respond
*  when a claim like that there is no afterlife is made, and they write things in the margin like
*  Opinio non cristiana, which is written in two of the copies that I've looked at, and we also see
*  which parts of a very long book that covers lots of topics they find exciting. It lets us see what
*  it was like for that world to encounter a different world. It's sort of like alien
*  first contact, and there it is preserved live for us in the margins of a book.
*  – Have you ever thought of annotating a classic out-of-copyright book and selling the finished
*  product as your annotations of the book? – No, although I have a copy of Lucretius into which
*  I've not only put my own annotations, but I have also transcribed the annotations from 36
*  Renaissance copies color-coded in different shades of ink. So it is probably the most heavily
*  annotated Lucretius that has ever existed, and it preserves the annotations not only of me, but of
*  two dozen Renaissance figures who annotated, including Machiavelli, and when you page through
*  it you can see a portrait of the whole period's encounter with Lucretius. So that's a very fun and
*  unique object. – I hope you can put it into an LLM and have it in the public domain.
*  – I would love to. – Why doesn't science fiction have higher social and literary status?
*  It's so rich with ideas, right? – So just working on an essay about this, a big part of it is that
*  science fiction as the modern genre that it is came into crystallization to be a specific type
*  of literature as opposed to an author writes novels and two of them happen to have a spaceship in them,
*  but the other ones don't. Or, you know, Dickens' Christmas Carol is technically fantasy, but nobody
*  thought of Dickens' Christmas Carol as fantasy when Dickens' was a live-cast fantasy didn't exist
*  as a genre. When science fiction originates and crystallizes as a genre and gets a name,
*  it is in the 1920s and 30s with the advent of pulp printing, which is the moment when we invent these
*  very large-scale machines that can print at mass volume on a much larger, cheaper sheet of paper.
*  So these are not printers that are printing two or four pages on one small sheet of high quality
*  paper. They are printing 12 or 24 pages on cheap disposable magazine newsprint. Those were used to
*  print magazines, but in the U.S. only and not Europe, they were also used to print cheap paperbacks,
*  which then went into racks that were sold in grocery stores and newspapers. Bookstores did
*  not like to stock those paperbacks. Bookstores, especially in the U.S., exclusively preferred to
*  stock hardcovers because they made more money on selling a hardcover than they did on a paperback.
*  So these pulp paperbacks, as we now call them, were of a different social status because they
*  weren't sold in bookstores, which existed in elite locations like affluent cities or near universities.
*  They were sold at hardware stores in little magazine racks where they competed with Hershey's
*  candy bars rather than competing with fellow books for the allowance money of a kid. And since that
*  was the birth of science fiction and the earliest people who identified and were identified as
*  science fiction writers and readers were producing for that market, it was born for a low-stask status
*  commodity, a very democratizing commodity, since of course those books were available to people in
*  huge swaths of the USA, for example, where there were no bookstores, where towns had no bookstore,
*  but they sure had a rack with 144 cheap paperbacks next to the grocery checkout.
*  But say Hammett and Chandler has been elevated to the canon, right, with time. In some ways,
*  science fiction hasn't seen the same evolution.
*  Well, neither has fantasy, and neither has horror, neither of westerns,
*  all of which were genres that crystallized in that point, although fantasy recrystallizes in
*  the late 1970s after the paperback publication of Lord of the Rings, which Tolkien never wanted
*  to allow to be out in paperback because it was low status.
*  In Terra Ignota, which hive would you belong to?
*  Utopia, which is the hive dedicated to exploration of the stars and the conquest of death.
*  I think humanist for me. In Ursula Le Guin, if you read the major novels,
*  at least in the fiction, there seems to be this suggestion that the only way you can get rid of
*  war is to really narrow or abolish or limit distinctions between men and women. Do you think
*  that's in, you know, left hand of darkness or dispossessed, and do you agree?
*  I don't agree, except in as much as there are a lot of behavior patterns that we now culturally
*  code female, which are artificially culturally coded female, but nonetheless, which we culturally
*  code female, which studies show are very good at crisis avoidance, consensus building,
*  and conflict management. All of these studies that show that women in political office handle
*  crises better than men in political office in a lot of different ways. This is not a biological
*  thing, but this is that a number of behavior patterns, including types of team building and
*  non-zero sum thinking, are culturally coded female and women are encouraged to do it,
*  whereas men are encouraged more to do aggressive problem solving, haggling, and zero sum thinking.
*  In my own classroom, where I often run this papal election simulation, and there's a survey that the
*  students have to fill out to say, what kind of participation in this political simulation would
*  you enjoy? It's always very interesting to me that while there's a huge range of genderedness
*  about most of the questions, the question, would you enjoy having a face-to-face opponent
*  where one or the other of you has to fall for the other to rise and there is no possibility of
*  compromise, you just have to go head on? That question is almost exclusively said yes to by
*  men or men are enthusiastic about it, women are more wary of it. Whereas the question, would you
*  enjoy being on or leading a team and being in charge of helping a group of people work together
*  to achieve a collaborative goal, is disproportionately answered yes by men. This is a
*  culturation thing, this is something that we learn when we're toddlers, that we learn when we're in
*  elementary school as different behaviors are encouraged or discouraged among both men and
*  women. And I think that it's not that we need to eliminate the differences between men and women,
*  it's that we need to get more of those female coded problem-solving behaviors to be welcome in
*  positions of power in one way or another. What is the current novel you're writing?
*  Vikings, Viking Metaphysics, this one is finally easy to describe. So I really love Vikings, this is
*  a Viking myth and history book and it looks at the question, well it looks at a number of questions,
*  but a big one that it looks at is if the Viking gods are real and only the Viking gods are real,
*  this is the cosmos that we're in, it is the Viking cosmos, but history is real history.
*  Why did they decide to let the worship of them die out and be displaced by other religions?
*  Why would that be allowed to occur in a world in which they are the actual governing power?
*  And the other thing that's really fun with it is that there's a lot of really great new
*  recent research on Viking myth, we're getting to understand the metaphysics a lot better,
*  we're retranslating a lot of the older canon, we're realizing that some of the works that
*  were kicked out of the canon in the 19th century and believed to be spurious or not spurious,
*  so that some of the ones we kept in are spurious that weren't, and so while there's tons of
*  science fiction and fantasy that already draws on Viking myth, there's very little of it that
*  draws on the very latest in Viking myth and I'm excited to dive into a lot of that material,
*  which I have access to just because I'm a scholar, right? This is one of the big problems of paywalls
*  because all of this is in journals that are behind paywalls or the ridiculous Oxford annotated Poetic
*  Edda, three volumes, $300 of volume, no wonder nobody has this book and like it's great, it's
*  full of wonderful materials, I wish I could give copies of it to every science fiction writer and
*  fantasy writer that's a friend of mine who likes this stuff so that they could use it in their
*  things, but good grief nobody can afford to spend a thousand dollars on the Oxford annotated Poetic
*  Edda, I only have it because I did a bunch of favors for Oxford editors until they gave me store
*  credit. You know I'm all for what you're doing and your podcaster would say that,
*  but what do your colleagues think if I may ask? Of the science fiction stuff they think it's great,
*  they think it's an important way of getting the latest research and improved historiography out
*  where it disseminates to the public. A good way to think about it is that dissemination works as a
*  pyramid and at the bottom of the pyramid are a thousand PhD students doing dissertations
*  discovering awesome new stuff and the next level up from that are several hundred books by somewhat
*  more experienced scholars who are drawing on not only their own dissertations with their friends
*  dissertations and what they've learned from going to conferences and debating this to make
*  syntheses that draw on a bunch of that research and then above that are a couple of dozen
*  popular history books that transform the latest in what historians are saying to each other
*  into a form that then gets out and is accessed by the public and then that in turn influences
*  actually it's not a pyramid it's more of an hourglass several hundred television series,
*  video games and novels which are really where we form our ideas of history right.
*  Nobody gets their first glimpse of the renaissance without already having run into the renaissance in
*  some form of fiction. We all encounter stories about this stuff before we encounter the scholarship
*  and so my colleagues have nothing but the best to say about the process of getting it out there in
*  a way that's going to hopefully also mean that another generation of people who want to write
*  more fiction will say oh wow there's a lot of new Viking stuff let's look at the new Viking stuff
*  and tell even better stories. And what's the science fiction anthology you're editing and writing for?
*  So two different things I'm doing a collection of essays co-authored with Joe Walton about
*  the subtitle is conversations on the project of science fiction and fantasy and some of it is about
*  craft of writing but some of it is about the history of the genre. There's a history in there
*  of the actual physical printing of science fiction books and how that influences what gets written
*  but there are also zoomed out essays about questions like what I call the protagonist problem
*  and how it is more and more rare these days for any book to have a structure other than
*  centering upon a core protagonist or we have an essay there in there about hope punk we have essays
*  about how science fiction historically has served to combat censorship and to increase international
*  empathy so it's a collection of detailed reflections on the genre its history and just how powerful it
*  is to influence the way we think as a society. I'm also co-writing with her a novel about an
*  exoplanet terraforming mission. Great last question let's say you are organizing a two to three day
*  event all expenses paid and you get to choose three or four people only living people they would
*  fly from anywhere in the world and come sit around and talk with you for these two or three days and
*  for these two or three days not people you currently know but with whom would you choose to meet?
*  Well can I run my papal election simulation? You can do whatever you want but who are the people?
*  Oh well if I can run my papal election simulation for them that I want a bunch of the
*  rising young congresspeople some of the younger senators and I also want people from the you know
*  administrate the equivalent levels of power within European Union governments and a few other places
*  because absolutely nothing teaches you to think about power and how it works like that and I would
*  love to see legislation that's been shaped by the way that event makes you rethink power.
*  Every time I run it I have people write to me even years later saying you know I decided to run for
*  office because I did this event I decided to go home to Russia and work with the democratic
*  resistance movement because this event showed me that I really can make a difference and especially
*  if I could bring in educational administrators people who make decisions about what kind of
*  education gets advanced from some of the powers that shape the world I would love to help them
*  see that we can teach people better to believe that they have power and that if we get this into
*  the way we teach people to think you know we can save democracy by making people actually be
*  confident in democracy and the first step to that is people being confident that what they do actually
*  makes a difference. Ada Palmer thank you very much. It's been a pleasure.
