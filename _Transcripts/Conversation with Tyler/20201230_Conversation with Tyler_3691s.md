# Conversations with Tyler 2020 Retrospective  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnX-Snnahk)
*  To get started, Tyler, I thought it's best to start with the big change this year.
*  Obviously the pandemic started in March and that forced a change in the production of
*  conversations with Tyler.
*  Unlike a lot of other podcasts, we had never done a remote interview before April.
*  I think while March was our first remote interview with Russ Roberts when we did the live bonus
*  episode right after everything shut down.
*  But we had to make this abrupt shift from doing absolutely every episode face to face
*  to now not being able to do any face to face.
*  I wonder how that change has affected you, your preparation, things like that.
*  It's changed my life doing these remote, but it's also made me much more optimistic about
*  the American economy.
*  So I was convinced that doing them remote would be terrible.
*  I was like, oh, you can't do them remote.
*  And it turns out we had to do them remote.
*  And I've asked a number of people and basically they can't tell the difference as listeners
*  whether or not it's remote.
*  They can tell by the fact that they're seeing the two separate little boxes on YouTube,
*  but they seem to me just as fine.
*  So I think you have to wonder how much of our economy can we in fact do remote?
*  And people like me have been saying, no, we can't do this remote.
*  And we can.
*  So I think having been forced into that new mode, there are in fact big productivity gains
*  on their way.
*  That said, we do hope to return to doing a lot of them face to face as soon as we can.
*  We'll see when that is.
*  But I for one will not be hesitating to get my vaccine.
*  Oh, you know what the biggest change has been from the pandemic is not having proper access
*  to the library.
*  So a lot of people, it's hard to prepare for them because you'd have to get all these books.
*  So I even said, I was like, oh, you know, Jeff and Dallas, we need to pick some economists
*  because to prepare for economists, you don't really need to read books.
*  Is that like a little bit of an insult?
*  But anyway, we did a bunch of economists.
*  I thought they turned out great.
*  And that was because of the pandemic.
*  And that was a bigger change than going from face to face to remote.
*  My reading habits.
*  To jump to a listener question then, what kind of split do you think, well, will there
*  be a split in terms of face to face and remote?
*  Will you go back to even acknowledging that maybe it's not that different, but for you
*  it's important, maybe it's just a differentiator in your mind to do it face to face?
*  Will you go back 100% face to face post vaccine?
*  Or do you think there will be some split?
*  Well, I just like meeting the people, right, above all.
*  That in a sense is my wage for doing things.
*  So we want to do Lydia Davis up in Albany.
*  I suspect she would do remote.
*  I'm not doing it because I want to meet her.
*  But I suspect it's the other side of the market that will constrain us.
*  They'll be like, well, you know, you don't have to come up.
*  Like we're willing to do it remote.
*  And actually they're terrified that I didn't really get a vaccine after all, or the vaccines
*  don't work, or maybe you were carrying tuberculosis by then.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't think it's going to be up to us for quite some time.
*  So I'll just take what reality sends me.
*  We have a backdrop of remote.
*  It works fine.
*  We'll see what we can do past that.
*  We'll get into predictions at the very end on some of this stuff.
*  Do you think, so you mentioned we shifted composition to people you don't have to do
*  as much research on because it's harder to do that.
*  Or online research, right?
*  It's not that there are no research, but I don't need the books of the library.
*  Right.
*  In terms of the composition of guests otherwise, you know, we didn't really do a lot of COVID
*  programming.
*  In fact, I'd say we did more counter programming to COVID.
*  We did a few, notably Paul Romer and Glenn Weil.
*  In terms of the guests or episodes, how do you think the composition other than the obvious
*  was affected by our switch?
*  Do you think we got different guests than we normally would?
*  You know, relative, you know, holding the kind of research side constant.
*  Do you think our composition of guests switched?
*  I don't think so much.
*  You know, we're well enough known now that say people with the new book out, they simply
*  want to do us whether we deserve them or not.
*  So that's good.
*  So, you know, maybe doing something like flying to London to do Knaussgard, I would have tried
*  something like that again.
*  I'm not sure with whom, like fly to Italy and yell out Elena Ferrante's name and hope
*  she appears with a tape recorder.
*  But something like that would have happened and it didn't.
*  We had three COVID episodes.
*  I'm glad we had three, but COVID has been covered very heavily by me on Marginal Revolution.
*  And I think whatever I have to say, people get there and it changes so quickly.
*  So I'm happy with the three we did.
*  And probably it's going to stay at that.
*  Yeah.
*  This was a year of repeat guests.
*  We actually, so we had Fuchsia Dunlop last year, but it was kind of a bonus episode.
*  It wasn't her featured again.
*  But this year we had Ezra Klein for the second time promoting a book, Ross Douthat promoting
*  a book, as you mentioned.
*  And then Russ Roberts is the bonus episode as a third.
*  Do you expect we'll do more repeats?
*  And Paul Romer, I forgot Paul Romer.
*  So we did him a second time as well.
*  Do you anticipate doing more repeats in the coming year?
*  Well I guess my new view is they're all bonus episodes, right?
*  I don't want to say we're going to do more repeats because it might get some people soaps
*  up.
*  But in fact, the repeats were really good.
*  So how many of these have we done, Jeff?
*  Do you know?
*  In total or this year?
*  In total.
*  In total, let me get a real time fact check from Dallas.
*  But I think we're at maybe 110.
*  Okay, so well over 100.
*  So counting this episode, which will be the last of the year, it'll be 112.
*  So that's a lot of people to be dredging up from the ranks.
*  And if someone's really good, they have more than an hour to say, right?
*  Even if someone isn't really good, they have more than an hour to say.
*  So maybe we'll do some more repeats, right?
*  Depends what people are up to.
*  Yeah.
*  We did have one guest who sadly we will not have a chance to ever interview.
*  Last year we had a confirmed time to interview Clayton Christensen.
*  Unfortunately, he had to postpone because his health took a turn for the worse and then
*  sadly he passed away at the very beginning of the year.
*  So we'll never get to hear that interview.
*  How were you hoping to learn from Clayton Christensen?
*  How he thinks disruption really works, how to improve the case study method at Harvard
*  Business School, how his Mormon upbringing and faith has influenced his ideas on management.
*  What's his favorite movie?
*  There's plenty we would have had to talk about with Clay.
*  He was a fan of what we were doing.
*  Very sad that probably will never happen.
*  All right.
*  Let's go a little bit into the numbers of CWT this year.
*  We'll talk about the most popular episode, picks for a most underrated episode this year,
*  and then we'll get into some, name that production function, our favorite segment on the easier
*  interview episodes.
*  So first, by the numbers, we did, counting this one, this will be our 29th episode of
*  the year.
*  So that's pretty typical for the past few years.
*  It's once every other week, plus a few bonus.
*  Any idea what the most downloaded episode was of this year?
*  I don't know at all, but my guess would be Matt Iglesias.
*  You are correct.
*  Wow, great.
*  Matt broke the record for first week downloads.
*  Because there is a bias that we do get growing listenership over time, so earlier episodes
*  will do slightly worse than later episodes in the year.
*  So if you look in the first six months, Adam Two's was the record breaker, which was a
*  big surprise actually to me.
*  I had no idea how ardent the Adam Two's fan base was, but he was also on Macro amusing's
*  David Beckworth's podcast that we produce here at Mercatus, and it did very well over
*  there too.
*  So Adam Two's is very popular.
*  And it was a good episode.
*  Adam and Matt are indicating Twitter really matters for your podcast audience, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That is very true.
*  And much discussed on Twitter.
*  And of course, Matt Iglesias shortly thereafter making moves and striking out on his own.
*  And also recently announcing that he's becoming a senior fellow over at Niskanen.
*  That's right.
*  That surprised me.
*  That's good.
*  Good for them, good for him.
*  All right.
*  Now underrated.
*  What are your picks for underrated?
*  I'm not necessarily equating this with listens, but listens does factor into it.
*  Well I don't even know how any of them are rated.
*  I thought the Alex Ross episode was really good.
*  I suspect Wagner fans rate it pretty highly, but there aren't so many of them.
*  So that's one of my picks for underrated.
*  Jimmy Wales.
*  I'm not sure it's underrated, but I think precisely because he's been successful and
*  moderate and reasonable.
*  Twitter doesn't go crazy over him one way or another.
*  So my guess is that will do very well in the long run.
*  But in the short run, it was not like a super social media driven thing because he is not
*  insane.
*  So I would name that as underrated.
*  Those would be the two picks that come to mind right away, but maybe you can tell me.
*  Yeah.
*  I think if you look at who underperformed, you clearly see a bit of a, you might call
*  it a liberal arts bias.
*  We have guests that are less known, A, and B, that they're talking about music or fiction
*  and they're not well known.
*  Again, that's when you tend to see a dip.
*  So Emily St. John Mandel, Edwidge Dandycat, they all did slightly worse.
*  And then I would say weirdly, the episode performed decently, but John McWhorter, as
*  I was looking through the stats, I was surprised.
*  I would say he underperformed.
*  I would say to the extent that that tells you something about performance and how people
*  rated it, then I would say John McWhorter underrated.
*  But here's what I suspect went on there.
*  He is so available in the podcast forum that you don't need to come to us.
*  And until very recently, Adam Tooze was quite underexposed in the podcast forum.
*  That's being remedied for the better.
*  We were the go to Adam Tooze place.
*  All right.
*  Let's jump into a round of Name That Production Function.
*  So we'll do two rounds of this.
*  And as a reminder to you, I've gone through and picked some of my favorite answers from
*  responses to your inquiries about a guest production function.
*  I picked some of my favorites, so I'm going to read you a quote and you guess who it is.
*  I'll be lucky to get one of these because I treat the segment as telling me what not
*  to do, not like something I should remember to do.
*  Yeah, and you but some of these are really easy.
*  You can we'll see.
*  Last year you did really well because you were able to use clues to guess.
*  So I think that'll be true this year.
*  All right.
*  So number one, I have a lot of projects on the go and switch between them.
*  Kierkegaard called it crop rotation.
*  You work on something, you put it to one side, and then you pick something else up.
*  I gave a TED talk on this.
*  I called it slow motion multitasking.
*  I think it's striking how many very successful people practice this and have these multiple
*  projects on the go.
*  They provide relief when you're stuck on something, you just do something else and don't get stressed
*  about it because you've got something else productive to do.
*  I have no memory, but it sounds like Tim Harford.
*  So that's my guess.
*  You are correct.
*  Good.
*  Thank you, Tim, for doing so much and reminding me of your productivity.
*  Tim, Tim in the early, you know, I think we recorded him late last year and he released
*  early this year.
*  So it does feel in some ways like a lifetime ago.
*  All right. Number two, I mostly did what I wanted to do.
*  This person is talking about going to school, like high school.
*  I mostly did what I wanted to do and not what I was told to do.
*  If I wasn't interested in a subject, I did very little on it.
*  If I like something, I would read 12 other books that no one told us to read on the topic.
*  I remember when in the college application, they had you list all the books you'd read
*  in the last year.
*  I would go down a list and I was so terrified they would think I was a liar that I ended
*  up cutting that list in half, lest they think I was making things up.
*  That sounds like a rich person.
*  So can I guess Reid Hoffman?
*  But again, I don't remember.
*  I like that your intuition was it's a rich person.
*  I don't know how rich he is, but it wasn't Reid Hoffman.
*  This is an academic.
*  Any second guess?
*  An academic?
*  Recorded very early.
*  Who would that be?
*  An academic.
*  Did we record any academics very early?
*  Other than Garrett Jones?
*  Jason Furman.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  Yes.
*  Yes, of course.
*  And he does read so much.
*  And of course the story with Jason Furman from a production standpoint is that we recorded
*  him, I think, in the first book.
*  And he was scheduled to release in the first few months of the year.
*  And we bumped him because we did have, I think, a more kind of pressing COVID episode.
*  And then we just couldn't find a natural place to slot him in.
*  And so he kept getting bumped and bumped and bumped and only released in the end of the
*  summer sometime.
*  So he's actually our last release that was recorded in person.
*  And so he's actually our last release that was recorded in person.
*  I still feel bad about that.
*  Like, somehow I didn't do him proper justice.
*  But he's not an academic.
*  That's what threw me.
*  Yeah.
*  His episode performed really well.
*  I mean, there were some, I don't know, CWT truthers who thought we had some agenda from
*  holding it as long as we did.
*  I can assure everyone it was for banal production reasons.
*  But his episode performed well.
*  So I think that's a good point.
*  And the part where he announced 2Q is, right?
*  I mean, that just took off like wildfire.
*  Yes.
*  It was our most viral episode for that reason.
*  No, actually, I will have to say, if I think of a revelation in an episode that I think
*  went underappreciated, Tyler, it's that you revealed in the Ashley Mears episode that
*  you have appellated the director of the film to be the director of the film.
*  And you revealed in the Ashley Mears episode that you have a Peloton bike.
*  And you, at least at the time, were using a Peloton bike was your main form of exercise.
*  Is that still the case?
*  It is.
*  Whenever the weather is bad, which is fairly often where I live, it's Peloton every day.
*  So and you have the full kind of you do the classes and everything or just the bike?
*  I don't like the software confuses me.
*  I can't figure it out.
*  But the bike is great.
*  Very happy to have it.
*  This is consistent with Tyler, I know.
*  Exactly.
*  Thank you.
*  Well, I'm glad to hear the Peloton is still working out for you.
*  Especially now, right?
*  This is late December.
*  So of course, I'm using it all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  All right.
*  Finishing on our first segment on production function.
*  This is kind of a negative production function in the sense that it's kind of something
*  that I'm not familiar with.
*  I'm just going to ask the question.
*  It's a question that I don't know if anyone else has thought of.
*  Yeah, I'm going to ask it.
*  I'm just going to look at the question.
*  I'm going to ask it.
*  It says, well, how did the design of this person realize they weren't good at?
*  Okay, here it goes.
*  But it turns out it is challenging to manage.
*  It involves real skills.
*  It stressed me out.
*  I don't think I did a great job of it.
*  You get a good appreciation for the idea of even though it might be hard to measure
*  worked at McKinsey. Again, that's a guess, not memory. But how's that?
*  That's a, that's a good guess. But wrong. But wrong. Wrong.
*  Totally wrong.
*  This person was referenced earlier and a hint they are not managing anyone
*  decidedly now. They've made a recent change.
*  Not managing anyone decidedly now.
*  Everyone's managing someone. I think.
*  They've struck out on a solo venture.
*  So Matt, of course it must be Matt. Yes.
*  Yes. So Matt, in the early days of Vox,
*  Matt was in more of a managerial position and he realized it wasn't for him.
*  And of course, maybe take him at a step further with a solo venture on
*  Substack. Yeah. Okay. Next one.
*  You will get this one because I'm not going to try to remove the,
*  I'm not going to try to remove the clues.
*  If you pack, if you wrap it up in some software, I promise I won't.
*  I think, yes, that if you're getting too many of these, that'll be my,
*  that'll be my tech.
*  I think music critics need to have a command of neighboring cultural areas
*  because music is not just separate from the rest of culture,
*  from the rest of our world. When you're writing about opera,
*  you're writing about literature as well as music.
*  You're writing about staging theater ideas.
*  So every music critic can't be a pure specialist.
*  That has to be Alex Ross, right?
*  Correct. All right. Last one in this segment.
*  I think almost part of it depends on how you look at the world.
*  Do you look at things and then try to think, okay, how can I simplify this?
*  How can I take something that's incredibly complex and narrow on a specific
*  dimension and really understand that in a way that can shed light on the world?
*  And then along with that, also being humble about the fact that that doesn't mean
*  you've understood everything. You've looked at one dimension,
*  it sheds lights on things, it sheds light on things,
*  but you need to really know what you don't know.
*  That was somebody's answer.
*  It was.
*  I have no idea. No idea whatsoever.
*  This one's hard. I'm trying to think if I can give you a good clue.
*  They're speaking in a way that would make sense given their academic work.
*  So this person gained notoriety for exploiting a certain econometric technique
*  and has used that to write a number of really good papers in economics.
*  That's Melissa Dalvin?
*  That's correct.
*  Okay.
*  So I think her answer was very in keeping with the fact that her papers can tell
*  you a lot about a very specific thing, but she was very careful about saying that,
*  you know, it only gives you part of the story and you have to be really careful
*  about what you don't know.
*  Sure. I'm looking for tips on like how to use my vacuum cleaner so I can,
*  you know, write more blog posts in the evening.
*  Well, you know what you don't know about vacuum cleaners, I think.
*  So that gives us a good excuse to turn into some Twitter questions.
*  All right.
*  Well, how about we go first to a question from a conversation with
*  Tyler producer Dallas Floor.
*  She has a couple of good ones, but the first was what's your go-to
*  quarantine snack these days?
*  Well, at the beginning it was pickles, but I got sick of pickles.
*  I believe you said in your post that pickles were great because you, they're
*  always delicious, but you don't overeat them.
*  But you.
*  I was, I was half right.
*  You don't overeat them, right?
*  But that means they don't stay your quarantine snack.
*  So I think just breaking off the piece of Whole Foods 365 sharp cheddar cheese
*  has become my go-to quarantine snack.
*  It is somewhat filling.
*  It has protein, some moisture, and I don't think it's that bad for you.
*  Yeah.
*  You said in the Russ Roberts interview, you said you were doing more cooking.
*  Is that still the case?
*  Yes, but less than I had been then because there's been outdoor, not right
*  now, but there's been outdoor dining for most of the year, but there wasn't that
*  when I was speaking to Russ, which was, I think early to mid March.
*  Yeah.
*  So here's another question from Twitter then at parosi1980 says, food question,
*  delivery and takeout during lockdown.
*  Is it a temporary blip or a permanent change to eating out?
*  Permanent change to some extent.
*  I think maybe a third of that shift will stick.
*  I don't myself like takeout.
*  I think the food tastes much worse.
*  I would just do whatever's possible to make it fresh served at the right moment,
*  at the right temperature.
*  And if that means I cook it, so be it.
*  If that means eat outside when it's cold, so be it, but eat food properly.
*  But I know the world does not agree with me.
*  I've had a small number of dining in episodes, but I'm always going at 11am
*  when no one else is there and there's only a small number of places I'll do even that.
*  Show up at 11, order.
*  No one else is there, leave by 1120.
*  That works in like two or three places I go to.
*  Jared Sylvester from Twitter asks, what is the post pandemic outlook for ethnic
*  restaurants and are any of your heuristics for finding good ones different now?
*  At least where I live, Northern Virginia, I've been surprised, I might even say
*  shocked at how few of them have closed.
*  So they must in some way be more thickly capitalized than I had thought.
*  So we can debate exactly when, how many people will take the vaccine and so on.
*  But it seems most of them are sustainable or they would have closed by now.
*  DC is a different story.
*  A lot have closed or they're just like weirdly boarded up.
*  But where I live, I haven't lost a single favorite that I'm aware of.
*  And that's very heartening.
*  So heuristics haven't really changed because...
*  Hasn't changed.
*  But I would say this, while the pandemic is still on, the value of comfort food is
*  higher, the value of complicated dishes is lower, they're harder to pull off
*  under current circumstances.
*  There are issues with kitchen crowding, staff can be lower.
*  The good side is you often have the best person in the kitchen cooking for you.
*  The downside is complex production is harder, but order simpler dishes and they
*  will taste better.
*  And that would be like a new rule, pandemic dining, order simpler dishes and
*  comfort food.
*  It will taste better and you will enjoy it more.
*  Yeah, I'm actually kind of ashamed to think I haven't thought about that when
*  I'm ordering takeout is I'm not really ordering what I think will actually travel
*  well or hold up well.
*  I still order what I want to taste, what I think will be delicious as if I were in
*  the restaurant.
*  So that's a helpful heuristic for me.
*  So thank you.
*  I don't think buffets will come back post-vaccine.
*  I think they will eventually, but we'll have to lose the collective memory of
*  being afraid of them.
*  Okay, let's switch to another big area that started the year and was sort of
*  eerily, I don't know, prescient is the wrong word for it, but a couple of
*  listeners indicated they really wanted to hear your thoughts on state capacity,
*  libertarianism, given that you started the year with this big post, you know,
*  outlining this sort of trying to name a new strand of libertarianism and indeed
*  arguing that it was the future of libertarianism.
*  And then we have this major global issue that, at least in my mind, directly
*  relates to some of the key points of tension or even just gaping fissures now
*  in a broader libertarian ideology about the proper role of government and what
*  restrictions we might take short or long term in order to let the government step
*  in and handle certain problems.
*  So I'm assuming I looked in the first post on marginal revolution that I found
*  that referenced coronavirus was until January 23rd.
*  And I think you were actually linking to a Bloomberg column.
*  That's correct.
*  So I don't even think, you know, this you've obviously written about pandemic
*  and preparation before years ago, but when you wrote this state capacity,
*  libertarianism column or post on marginal revolution, you weren't really
*  thinking at all about the fact that, you know, there was something brewing in
*  Wuhan.
*  Correct.
*  I had read the Wuhan reports and I was concerned, but events of concern come out
*  of China fairly often with flu viruses and the like.
*  And I didn't then think this one was it.
*  I did mention it to some people on WhatsApp.
*  So I was following it.
*  But I think right now libertarians are at a kind of war with each other.
*  I'm not sure a state capacity libertarianism is the future of
*  libertarianism, but it's the future or present of my libertarianism.
*  I just think Milton Friedman said this too.
*  He said, one of the public goods you need government for is to control
*  contagious diseases.
*  This is that when it happens, you will best secure liberty by beating back the
*  virus.
*  That does mean, say, subsidies for vaccines and government taking an active
*  role and trying to support testing.
*  We did a better job with vaccines than testing.
*  And that's the case when you really want your government to have its act
*  together.
*  And you can see a big difference between countries where the government did a
*  good job and countries where government did a bad job.
*  And it has long run implications for their liberty.
*  What surprised me is how many libertarians moved into a kind of denialism,
*  like, oh, this isn't so bad.
*  It's only the old people.
*  It only kills whatever percent.
*  Sort of older, more macho libertarians would have said, oh, this virus is
*  terrible.
*  I mean, we need to let the market rip to crush it.
*  And if we would let the market do whatever, you know, that that would be so
*  great and the market would crush the virus better than the government.
*  I don't think that's quite true as stated, but it would have been a very
*  libertarian response.
*  But instead, I think there's been a lot of people who've gone down different
*  rabbit holes that haven't really been that truthful or have involved very off
*  predictions like, oh, all this thing will be over with by, you know, the fall or
*  something.
*  You know, when I read that post now, it seems to me a pretty clear distinction.
*  You're talking about sort of the old emphasis on, as you say, like, there might
*  be the thing of like, well, we just need to let the market go.
*  And so the argument is not this isn't a risk.
*  It's that the best way to solve it is to have the strong market response.
*  Do you see that as being a clean line here?
*  When you were writing that post, you're thinking the kinds of people who were
*  emphasizing state capacity more and what it can do to empower individual action or
*  whatever, are exactly the kind of people who are now arguing within each other in
*  the libertarian community in that response.
*  I think who ended up where is 80, 85 percent predictable.
*  No, I would stress I'm not a big fan of lockdowns.
*  I did think in March we did the right thing by closing so many things so quickly
*  because we knew so little and had to prepare hospitals and just figure out that
*  like you can do things outside.
*  And if you're modestly careful, it's probably fine almost all of the time.
*  But since then, I don't think lockdowns have been a good idea.
*  So I think really.
*  Lockdowns are just shifting exposure through time.
*  What you want to do is get to the point where you are winning the war against the
*  virus and that you will do better with vaccines and testing, even tracing
*  I've mixed feelings about.
*  Clearly, there are countries that have done it well, but I'm not sure I ever
*  thought that would be possible in the United States.
*  We are not a trace kind of country.
*  And same with England.
*  It's just not something we're going to be very good at.
*  We're too big. We're too complicated.
*  We're too messy. We don't even have an integrated system of national ID, which
*  I'm fine with, by the way, that we don't.
*  But given that, we don't have systematic electronic medical records compatible
*  across all systems.
*  So odds are trace was never going to work here, in my view.
*  So childhood friend and listener to the show, Paul Matsko, on the state capacity
*  libertarianism question says he suggested the framing and I'll just provide it to
*  you based on the events of 2020.
*  What are the best cases you what are the best cases you can make for or against
*  state capacity libertarianism?
*  So let's do the pro case.
*  What is the pandemic?
*  How does the how does the pandemic bolster the case for state capacity
*  libertarianism?
*  Well, our best program in the United States, Operation Warp Speed, will have
*  ended up making an enormous difference, getting us vaccines sooner and a broader
*  choice of vaccines.
*  And if some of those in the pipeline had failed, the fact that we invested in this
*  portfolio of seven would have turned out to have been very important.
*  As I'm speaking, we're not completely sure how important that will be.
*  But ex ante, that was a brilliant decision and arguably we should have done more.
*  So that's the good side.
*  I think the downside of state capacity libertarianism is simply realizing there
*  are some very nice features to not being surveilled all the time, as they do in
*  China.
*  When I said a moment ago that the United States is not very good at trace, though
*  it's good at innovating.
*  If you had stronger state capacity, presumably you should worry more about
*  state surveillance.
*  And I do.
*  So that to me is the best case against state capacity libertarianism, as I
*  envision it.
*  Even though having a good trace regime would have been fine in this instance, I'm
*  not sure it would have been a good precedent.
*  Yeah, one thing's about the fact that I think it's still the case that Germany
*  can't do a census because they're just such a cultural resistance to a
*  census, a national census, because of the way it was misused in the past.
*  And it's interesting how these cultural attitudes affect the ability of the
*  government to respond and set long term, have these longer term effects.
*  But Korea, South Korea did a remarkable trace.
*  One person would get something and they trace that person to hundreds of
*  others and then test them.
*  Just as a logistics operation, just incredible what they did.
*  Yes, my mother-in-law is Korean and went back to Korea over the summer and her
*  experience traveling there and the procedures and it probably was your ideal
*  version of state capacity because it was very much empowering you to live your
*  life.
*  But you were required to take a number of steps, including downloading a
*  number of steps, including downloading, I think, three different tracing apps and
*  getting a lot of notifications about exposures and everything else.
*  But she was able to actually have a holiday while she was taking care of some
*  family business.
*  But here's the thing. I did not get onto a plane and fly to Korea.
*  Now, I would have had to have quarantined.
*  I think there was for two weeks.
*  I don't recall. But whatever the period was, I could have done that.
*  So I actually preferred to stay here.
*  But socially, overall, they did quite a good job.
*  Revisiting your conversation with Russ, and I think it's instructive just for all
*  of us to go back and examine what our attitudes were in middle March when things
*  were starting to shut down and how long we thought things would last and so on.
*  It seemed like if you look, if you kind of read between the lines of what you all
*  were saying, I think the worst case scenario that you outline was that, you know,
*  we'll still be in a situation like we are now, maybe through August, maybe later.
*  I think you open it up to being a little bit later.
*  If we had known in March that it would be, say, a year before
*  life would resume to normal in some form of normal,
*  where people can interact more freely in person.
*  And I know a lot of this is endogenous, but if we had known that we were in it for
*  a year in March, how do you think things would change?
*  Would it have made things worse or better?
*  I'm not sure it would have mattered because many people have been acting with very
*  short time horizons. I think overall, my predictions in that episode are quite
*  good. I reread it recently.
*  And the biggest thing I got wrong was I thought unemployment would stay higher
*  for longer than it did.
*  And the general underlying mistake in my forecast was I thought people would stay
*  terrified for longer than they did.
*  And they have resumed in many parts of the country in numerous ways.
*  And that has led transmission to last longer in many cases.
*  It's also helped the job market come back.
*  So that's what I was off on.
*  But I think I even said in that dialogue, well, we'll probably have vaccines by
*  March of 2021.
*  And at the time, that was a very bizarre prediction that was not being widely
*  made. And it turns out, you know, it'll have been very, very close to correct.
*  Yes. And we can jump back into Twitter questions then.
*  I'm also wondering when you're going to mention the biggest single event in CWT
*  of the whole year. And I wonder if we even agree on what it is.
*  But continue.
*  Oh, my gosh. Now that the tables have turned, now I'm scrambling to think of what
*  that could be.
*  Well, it's a recent episode.
*  You may not have even heard it yet.
*  But anyway, go on.
*  OK. Well, I think I think I know what you're talking about now.
*  But let's let's go back to Twitter and then we'll see.
*  Actually, well, let's not change there.
*  We'll go to Twitter and we'll stay we'll stay somewhat along COVID lines.
*  Brandon Tice on Twitter asks, what are your tips for planning safe but still
*  enjoyable local road trips?
*  Do you think trips are still advisable with a emerging wave?
*  I know you had spoken earlier about you went and visited New York at a time when
*  after their wave had ceased and it was actually arguably safer to go there than
*  to stay in northern Virginia at the time.
*  How how would your outlook on trips change?
*  Do you have anything planned for the winter months?
*  I'm reluctant to tell people they should go because many of them shouldn't.
*  They might be more vulnerable than I am or just less disciplined as travelers.
*  So when I went to New York, for one thing, I drove up, which I typically never do.
*  And I was not even willing to use like the restrooms and the New Jersey turnpike,
*  which are ghastly in the best of times.
*  But I'm just like, I'm going to pull over the car and do my business right here.
*  And that, of course, is extremely safe.
*  And New York then had about one tenth the COVID load than northern
*  Virginia did when I went.
*  So I saw more people, but it was all outside.
*  And at one tenth the load, I was pretty sure I was not boosting my net risk.
*  And the trip itself seemed safe.
*  But again, most people will set out to do something like that.
*  And I'm not sure if they'll all pull it off.
*  So, you know, right now I'm hanging around waiting for my vaccine,
*  figuring out how I will get one.
*  And I don't have a trip planned, but I don't need to plan to do a trip.
*  So we're just going to see how everything goes.
*  Very well. Another question for Twitter from Sisyphus.
*  What policy, not Sisyphus, Sisyphus.
*  It's a fun one. What policy consequences, if any, can we draw from the rapid
*  development of vaccines in response to the pandemic?
*  Is there any way to accelerate innovation in other areas similarly?
*  And I'll just add on to this. I thought it was interesting that in your
*  conversation with Russ, you know, you had already, this is true to form for you,
*  but you had mentioned the notion of big prizes as a way to try to spur
*  innovation. And then in some ways you could see almost the seeds for fast grants
*  being discussed in that conversation, though I know it came separately.
*  But maybe this is a chance for you to talk a little bit about fast grants,
*  but then other ideas that you see based on the success of the rapid development
*  of vaccines.
*  Including fast grants, but not only.
*  The world has seen it can address critical problems much more quickly than
*  it had thought.
*  So the use of the Internet to spread science was a big factor.
*  Philanthropists stepping up.
*  By own effort, fast grants, the idea of fast grants,
*  the idea that you would get grants to top researchers within a number of days
*  and make the submission form super easy.
*  Not that people had to worry about what kind of font was being used on the
*  submission. Not that they would have to wait six months for an answer,
*  but they would hear back in a few days and get the money, you know,
*  a day or two later.
*  We showed that can work.
*  And we did that to a scale of about $43 million and could have done more.
*  And it had a pretty substantial impact.
*  So not just that,
*  but everyone sees when you put your mind to it,
*  you can be a lot better and do things more quickly.
*  And I hope we keep that lesson emotionally internalized and don't just do
*  it for the stuff that feels pressing now, but do it for many more things.
*  Take Dengue, right? Always with us.
*  It's not a new thing. Doesn't command the headlines.
*  It's a very high number of people each year can ruin their lives.
*  We should do more. We can do more.
*  I think the pessimistic case would be one reason we were able to act so quickly
*  on COVID is because it became this clear focal point where that was the thing to
*  do is to figure out this problem. And once we figure out this problem,
*  that energy will dissipate in ways that will
*  prevent the kind of speed that we saw. Do you agree with that take or disagree?
*  It's certainly true. That is a big advantage,
*  but I think as people expand the size and scope of their mental models,
*  they will see you can carve out sub sectors of academia,
*  of philanthropy, of government, of private sector,
*  that take other maladies very seriously.
*  And they're not going to quite have the same urgency. I mean,
*  one big advantage, if you would call it that, not advantage,
*  but other labs were closed unless you were doing COVID work.
*  So at least for a while there was a big substitution into COVID work
*  and that's not going to be very common, right?
*  But I also think the other tasks will benefit a lot from the work done on
*  COVID. So the notion of a semi-universal vaccine,
*  testing to find other viruses,
*  using mRNA vaccine platforms to combat other things,
*  all those will be offshoots of the COVID triumphs. I believe,
*  I hope, I think,
*  and we need to see those through and not just give up on them.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  Let's jump into the second round of Name That Production function.
*  These are all related to writing. And I think,
*  I think these are a little bit easier, but let's see. All right. All right.
*  So first one, from engineering,
*  I learned to start with an outline and decide what I wanted to say,
*  and then write all the sections to meet my outline.
*  Justice Breyer taught me just write all my paragraphs and then work backwards to
*  figure out what I had to say after the fact.
*  Engineering, Justice Breyer, who do we have on these shows?
*  What I'm, what I'm learning is that our recollection of these episodes, I mean,
*  this is true of me as well, is that, um,
*  a lot of these past episodes just feel a long time ago.
*  I can distinctly remember doing this episode last year and the episodes felt
*  very fresh to me. Uh, but this year,
*  it feels like long periods of time have passed since we've recorded some of
*  these, but this person studied engineering at MIT and then became a lawyer.
*  Studied at MIT and then became a lawyer.
*  I don't know who is that.
*  That is Rachel Harmon, who you spoke to about policing,
*  because she's done a lot of scholarship on.
*  Oh, of course. You know, I don't have her.
*  I brought a little cheat sheet list and you gave me a cheat sheet list and I
*  made the mistake of looking at mine rather than yours and her name wasn't on
*  it. That's why, not that I forgot her episode. It was a good episode.
*  Yeah, it is a good episode. And, um, um, and yeah, I think worth revisiting,
*  but, um, yeah,
*  studied in my engineering at MIT and then, um,
*  became a lawyer and talked about how those two kind of ways of viewing the world
*  has been useful for her, not just in writing. Okay. Uh,
*  second one on writing in college,
*  I would munch on a box of Dunkin donuts to get through a term paper.
*  Now I find whatever cookies my kids have. I always have some sweet junk food.
*  This is probably not really great advice for anybody, but it's just my habit.
*  Is that Emily St. John Mandel?
*  No, this is, uh, Ashley Mears. Okay.
*  Uh, and that very good episode, one of the best of the year, I thought.
*  Yes, Ashley Mears, uh, and I think, uh, performed, performed well.
*  I think people did give that one. I was worried people wouldn't give it a chance,
*  but from the numbers, people, uh,
*  seem to have given it a chance and I think, uh,
*  those who listened to it really enjoyed it. All right, next one.
*  I haven't always found writing easy at all.
*  I've been to a lot of therapy of various types to stabilize myself emotionally
*  and psychologically. I still do.
*  It's very important for me in handling the stresses that arise in writing.
*  And one of the things I realized that in the course of that is actually,
*  rather than thinking it was something terrifying that I had to steal myself to
*  do, the best way to think about it was something I do every day.
*  So it's like exercise. If I had the chance, I like to exercise.
*  It's a puzzling activity. I just treat it almost like a game,
*  rearranging the words, trying to fix things.
*  Now is that Emily St. John Mendel?
*  No, no. Who is it?
*  This is Adam Two's.
*  Ah, okay.
*  Uh, Adam Two's who writes, you know, very prolifically, um,
*  but confessed that, you know, it was a struggle for him and he's, uh,
*  one breakthrough that he's had is similar to you, but he's had,
*  he's just changed in his mindset to a default.
*  It's just something he does and doesn't think about. It's not,
*  he doesn't psych himself up to do it anymore.
*  It's just something like brushing your teeth. It's just something you do.
*  Okay. Last one.
*  My parents, my parents really loved books.
*  We always had a ton of books in the house. We went to the library every week.
*  I had enormous time to read.
*  There was a period of time when one of the requirements of the curriculum was
*  that I had to write something every day.
*  That's what got me writing in the first place.
*  I might've had a completely different life if I hadn't had so much time to spend
*  reading in such a focus on books.
*  I'm going to guess Emily St. John Mandel again.
*  Third time's the charm. You're correct. That one was Emily St. John Mandel.
*  Thank you for playing, uh, named that production function. Um, I, uh,
*  I, is it just me or did you not explicitly ask it this much this year?
*  Um, I was reviewing the conversations and I,
*  I did leave some out for this segment,
*  but it also didn't seem to come up as explicitly as a segment.
*  If it came up, it was a little more organic. Yeah.
*  I just think you have to vary somewhat and not become too formulaic.
*  And even if something is good or people like it,
*  better to leave them wanting more than they just know it's coming all the
*  time. So that's part of my production function.
*  Yeah. Um, okay. So why don't we, uh,
*  so you mentioned that I haven't brought up the big highlight of the year. So what,
*  what is it, Tyler? Do you want to quiz me or do you want to just tell me what
*  you think of as your highlight of the year?
*  Well, you tell me what you think it is.
*  From context clues, I'm guessing it's your interview with John Brennan.
*  Is that right?
*  That's correct. And one of my questions in particular,
*  I'm reluctant to speak for him because the exact wording is very important and
*  careful. So I urge you all to check the transcript.
*  But I asked him about UFOs and I pushed him on it.
*  And as I understood his answer again with the scavia,
*  please read and listen to his words. Don't take my word for it.
*  But I took him to be saying that the single most likely
*  explanation was in some way alien beings.
*  Now he wasn't saying that's higher than 50%,
*  but simply that of all the explanations,
*  he didn't see a better one than that.
*  And he was head of the CIA for what? Four years. Now he wasn't pretending to know.
*  He's not like, Oh, I've got the little green men, you know,
*  hidden under the ground somewhere in Langley.
*  Just after having thought about it long and hard,
*  he thought we needed to seriously entertain that possibility. But again,
*  please check his words.
*  One of the crazy things about 2020 has been this sort of
*  under, sort of under discussed acceptance of what you just described,
*  that it has become more mainstream is the wrong word,
*  but more accepted among smart people that we may be seeing actual
*  signs of alien life or it may not be likely,
*  but it's becoming the most likely explanation.
*  And there's, you know, even if it is, which I give, you know, 5%,
*  I've been saying it's almost certainly drones,
*  not that the proverbial little green men are inside,
*  but it should be a big, big thing.
*  And it isn't. And that to me is so startling.
*  So Brennan can say what he said.
*  It won't be on the front page of the New York Times.
*  Some number of people will talk about it.
*  To me, that's more remarkable than the phenomenon itself.
*  It's the lack of interest. Oh, a Fermi paradox.
*  Well, it turns out, you know, they've been here. Oh, whatever.
*  Okay. Forget about that one.
*  I, yes.
*  And I think that relates back to COVID too, because in any kind of
*  dramatization of a pandemic, it is so focal to people's,
*  it is the thing that everyone is thinking about all the time.
*  And that has not been the case across the country for even,
*  you know, for someone like me. I mean, there are certainly days when,
*  you know, I'm not, you know, driving through quarantine checkpoints.
*  I'm living my life in my house and trying to keep to myself.
*  And similarly, there have been a number of stories that have come out in 2020
*  that if you were experiencing the movie version of this,
*  it would be a huge thing that the characters would be listening to on the
*  radio and it would be, everyone would be buzzing about it.
*  And they've just gone totally unnoticed.
*  I've never seen a year like this, right?
*  Yeah. In some ways it's kind of,
*  you think about how the history books will be written about it.
*  Cause we think it'll be all COVID,
*  but it might be all these crazy discoveries that we made in 2020 that some
*  of which had something to do with COVID, but many of which didn't.
*  SpaceX and protein folding.
*  A lot happened this year that arguably is getting us out of the great stagnation.
*  Yeah. Okay. So more questions for Twitter and then we'll wrap it up.
*  Paul Tilly on Twitter asks,
*  what industries or groups surprised you in their response to COVID, good or bad?
*  Well, that the NBA just shut down all games as early as it did in March
*  was brilliant and prescient.
*  And that the day would have the guts to pull the button on that rather than
*  dragging it out. I give them, you know, a big A plus four.
*  So that surprised me. I've always liked the NBA,
*  but for that they deserve a prize on the
*  downside. You know,
*  I don't think you should blame small businesses or businesses for wanting to
*  reopen, even if it's bad for society,
*  maybe you should blame the people who go.
*  But just the ease at which people have considered going to these very large
*  scale events like college football games in a way that to me just doesn't
*  make any sense. So I believe in intertemporal substitution. If you can,
*  don't do it for a year, but next year go to twice as many games.
*  And how hard people find that to do is really striking.
*  And we actually need to incorporate into our economic models.
*  So I can travel less this year and next year vaccinated.
*  I might take more trips, right? If the world will let me do more face to face
*  CWTs and so on. Hang out with Lydia Davis, whatever.
*  But people don't think that way.
*  It's more a utility function of habit formation than intertemporal substitution
*  than I would have thought. And I already knew the behavioral evidence on that.
*  So it's not that I'm completely in the dark that people aren't entirely rational,
*  but even then I've revised my priors.
*  Yeah. Another question from Nicole Mulaney.
*  Any big changes to your production function in 2020 that you think will stick
*  around for the future?
*  Oh, will stick. Well, doing these by zoom will partially stick,
*  I suspect.
*  I think I wake up slightly later in the morning,
*  not by much, just like by 10, 15 minutes. I wonder if that will stick.
*  Cooking more. Nah, that's not going to stick.
*  So mostly I'll go back. I hope, you know, again,
*  it's when the world lets me is the binding constraint. And I think it will.
*  You mentioned in your conversation with Russ that you thought, you know,
*  that there would be kind of an average is over aspect to the return to
*  face to face that more would happen over zoom or
*  remotely because we've gotten better at it. And then the face to face would,
*  you would require more of it that you would,
*  you would savor it and maybe even save it for
*  special occasions or just, yeah, try to get more out of it. Do you,
*  do you, that there might be some exuberant return to face to face. Do you think,
*  do you think that's going to happen? Vaccine rollout?
*  I use more explicit language than that. If you recall,
*  it may happen before vaccine rollout.
*  But I think that will be the case.
*  There'll be a certain amount of people going crazy and that might just mean a
*  lot of trips to the shopping mall. It might mean
*  other things that won't mention on a family podcast.
*  But a lot of people have just returned to normal routines already. So again,
*  that's a big part of what surprised me,
*  but certainly not say in California or New York, you haven't really been able to.
*  Have you thought at all about the, how it might be determined by locality?
*  I mean, living in DC, one of the things that you get a viewpoint in is I,
*  I was living in DC. I could see what was happening in Maryland.
*  I could see what was happening in DC. I could easily see what was happening in
*  Virginia. And then for anyone who's done any kind of interstate travel by
*  car, it's striking the degree to which you can just sense the different
*  response, just passing through.
*  And so in a place like DC or say LA, which is still very, you know,
*  you have to wear a mask in public versus other places where it's, oh, well,
*  it's indoors. And if, you know, it's a little more laissez faire,
*  even if they have restrictions on the books, I wonder if that will linger,
*  if there will be the kind of,
*  you go to DC and playground etiquette will be different than playground etiquette,
*  you know, in North Carolina or whatever.
*  I think it will. We've been cut off from each other.
*  People don't quite know how other places are, what they're doing, how they feel.
*  I've been to Maryland, Chesapeake, West Virginia, Southern Ohio, New Jersey,
*  New York City, New York State, Northern Virginia, of course,
*  the part of Maryland near DC.
*  And each and every one of those areas has been quite different.
*  And again, I'm not sure that's something I would have expected.
*  It's a kind of counter to these globalization, homogenization arguments.
*  And I do think much of that will stick.
*  Yeah. All right. Last question for Twitter from Craig Paulson,
*  a V fellow. He asked when we're going to get the book with Daniel Gross on
*  talent. This is your next book, I believe. Any update on timeline there?
*  We have a draft of about 80,000 words, if I recall.
*  It is not finished, but it is well along.
*  And the when depends exactly on the publisher.
*  Of course, we're recording this before it is being presented to all you
*  listeners. I expect that by the time you're hearing this, I will know when,
*  but at the moment I don't quite know exactly when, but it's well along.
*  It's not like a figment dream in our heads. It exists.
*  It needs to be better. It needs to be finished.
*  But it will come out and not, you know, five years from now.
*  All right. So let's switch to thinking about the year ahead.
*  So I'm going to ask you to channel your,
*  I don't know your super forecasting abilities. First question.
*  Will you be moving to Substack in the coming year?
*  No. I write for free on marginal revolution.
*  I'm fully aware that people who do Substack can earn a lot of money.
*  But I'd actually rather have the bigger audience. And as you all know,
*  conversations with Tyler is free. There's no ads. It's fully open.
*  And I just think that to have audiences like this is a privilege greater than
*  the money. I know that's weird, but.
*  No, I think, I think we're going to, I very much enjoy producing a podcast
*  that we don't have to worry about monetizing it explicitly by running ads.
*  As much as I would enjoy having Tyler read ad copy every episode,
*  I think, I think that would get old quickly.
*  In what month do you think we will record the first in-person CWT?
*  Oh, I think that's pretty random. You know, it could be quite soon.
*  If it's outdoors, there's that homeless man, you know, we want to record.
*  It could just be someone I know and trust.
*  I'm not sure where I'll be in prior to that.
*  I'll be in priority line for vaccines, but I'll say February.
*  All right, February. Yeah, we have talked about doing one out there.
*  And it depends on you and Dallas and other people. I mean,
*  if you all don't want to do it, you know, we're not going to do it.
*  So someone has to be there to make it work. And, you know,
*  it is unanimity rule. It's not my say so.
*  Yeah. I think the big, the big issue has been travel.
*  And if you have to travel, then it's harder to do it safely.
*  But certainly if the people are local, that's something we can certainly accommodate.
*  Will we hold a live event for CWT, live recording in 2021?
*  Calendar 2021, I'll predict yes.
*  But not in the spring. Yeah, I think so, too.
*  Again, maybe with the caveat that we in the warmer months,
*  it's not necessarily that everyone has gotten the vaccine, but, but we,
*  here's the thing. The auditorium is not booked, right? That's a big head start.
*  Not related to CWT. And will you,
*  when will you watch a movie in a theater with people you don't know?
*  Last week.
*  Oh, you've done it.
*  Natasha, well, you rent out the theater privately.
*  And Natasha invited two of her Russian friends in a theater that like seats 150.
*  And I'm like, I don't know these people. Do you trust them?
*  And she does.
*  And she gave me really very convincing evidence that they're even like past the
*  point of optimal safety and to sit in opposite corners of a huge theater.
*  I've been running out theaters a few times,
*  it's not as much as you think. And I hope the price doesn't go up.
*  It's a great thing to do.
*  So yeah, you got out of that question on technicality.
*  So you were with people you don't know,
*  but I was thinking specifically of a scenario in which you're buying a ticket
*  and you don't have control of the theater.
*  When do you think that'll happen for you?
*  Well, the second vaccine dose is two or three weeks after the first.
*  So that day, no, you need some time for immunity to kick in.
*  So that's probably another two weeks.
*  Is that an answer to the question of what's the first thing you're going to be
*  doing as soon as that?
*  Absolutely. I mean, it depends what's showing, right?
*  But that's the first thing I want to do.
*  How important is the theater? What speaks to you about the theater experience?
*  Do you care about the technical specs of projection and sound? Is it?
*  Everything. It's the greatest art form of the 20th century.
*  And I was born in the 20th century and I'm going to stick with that form as long
*  as I can and see what it does for me. It's not always good.
*  I'm very willing to walk out.
*  But I want to be in the theater again,
*  seeing a new release and not having to pay a hundred bucks to rent out the
*  whole thing. But in the meantime, I will pay up. Yes.
*  Well, I hope that you will be able to enjoy a theater
*  and enjoy going to see movies with other people.
*  I hope that we will be able to see each other face to face because I don't think
*  we've even seen each other face to face since maybe April when I recorded
*  the TedLock episode remotely.
*  And we were very concerned with like disinfecting the microphone and wearing
*  gloves, but masks were not a thing yet. But we did it in a socially distanced
*  way. But I am looking forward to a resumption of
*  some face to face with conversations with Tyler in the next year.
*  And before I go,
*  I want to thank everyone on the team who has helped make our switch this year
*  possible. There's been a lot of work done behind the scenes to prep guests
*  and to equip them with equipment they need to keep the quality and conversations
*  high. So let me give a shout out to everyone who helped out this year.
*  That's Dallas Floor, Grav and Laura, Caitlin Schmidt, Kate Brown,
*  Kate Delanois, Mike Hopper, Sloan Shearman, Karen Plant, Christina Beehe,
*  Haley Larson, Anna McVeigh, Carter Woolley, Ashley Schiller.
*  Thank you all very much.
*  And we look forward to another year of production.
*  You remember that list better than I remember people's production functions,
*  but I would second and third that wholeheartedly.
*  And thanks to you all for listening and or reading a great pleasure to have you
*  as an audience and you yourself, Jeff, obviously should be on the list.
*  Thank you.
