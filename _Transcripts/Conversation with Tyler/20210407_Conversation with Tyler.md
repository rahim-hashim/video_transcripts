Video Description: Before he was California Poet Laureate or leading the National Endowment for the Arts, Dana Gioia marketed Jell-O. Possessing both a Stanford MBA and a Harvard MA, he combined his creativity and facility with numbers to climb the corporate ladder at General Foods to the second highest rung before abruptly quitting to become a poet and writer. That unique professional experience and a lifelong “hunger for beauty” have made him into what Tyler calls an “information billionaire,” or someone who can answer all of Tyler’s questions. In his new memoir, Dana describes the six people who sent him on this unlikely journey.
  
In this conversation, Dana and Tyler discuss his latest book and more, including how he transformed several businesses as a corporate executive, why going to business school made him a better poet, the only two obscene topics left in American poetry, why narrative is necessary for coping with life’s hardships, how Virgil influenced Catholic traditions, what Augustus understood about the cultural power of art, the reasons most libretti are so bad, the optimism of the Beach Boys, the best art museum you’ve never heard of, the Jungianism of Star Trek, his favorite Tolstoy work, depictions of Catholicism in American pop culture, what he finds fascinating about Houellebecq, why we stopped building cathedrals, how he was able to effectively lead the National Endowment for the Arts,  the aesthetic differences between him and his brother Ted, his advice for young people who want to cultivate their minds, and what he wants to learn next.

# Dana Gioia on Becoming an Information Billionaire  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkWUJODmxyM)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I have Dana Joya and the way I think of Dana is he is the only guest I have ever
*  had who can answer all of my questions.
*  But he does have another biography.
*  At the top of the biography it reads, Dana Joya is an internationally acclaimed poet and
*  writer.
*  He is the former California poet laureate and former chairman of the National Endowment
*  for the Arts.
*  Most notably he has a new book out.
*  It's a kind of memoir, excellent book.
*  I loved reading it.
*  It's called Studying with Miss Bishop.
*  Memoirs from a young writer's life.
*  Miss Bishop of course being Elizabeth Bishop.
*  But Dana has numerous other books including Books of Poetry, a book the Catholic writer
*  today.
*  Perhaps his most famous work is Can Poetry Matter?
*  Dana is also an accomplished librettist for opera and he has done much much more on top
*  of all of that.
*  And Dana, welcome.
*  I'm glad to be here.
*  Good to see you again.
*  It's been many years.
*  Correct.
*  First question, a total softball.
*  Why was Jack Benny such an effective spokesperson for Jell-O?
*  Because he was the most popular radio comedian in the United States.
*  And why were you such an effective advertising executive for Jell-O?
*  Because I spent about a year and a half figuring out what was the possible way that we could
*  get people to use more Jell-O.
*  And then I convinced the company which took another year.
*  But it was really hard work.
*  Creativity and research.
*  So how did older and younger women use Jell-O differently?
*  What you're referring to is the epic moment in General Foods' life when we invented the
*  Jell-O Jiggler, which was rather than creating an elaborate recipe, which was what we were
*  trying to sell people for for 40 years, simply a way that you could add water with your kids,
*  put it in the refrigerator and have it ready as a finger food in one hour.
*  So it was like a platform for Jell-O?
*  Yeah, it was a way of using three times as much Jell-O for an occasion in which people
*  had never used Jell-O, which is sort of to make your own gummy bears.
*  So it became a mom-kid activity.
*  And we sold every box of Jell-O in the United States for several months.
*  And how was it that you picked out Jell-O to start with in your corporate career?
*  Because I was one of the businesses I was running and it was one of the two most profitable
*  businesses at General Foods.
*  And so it had been declining for 25 years without a break.
*  And we doubled the business overnight.
*  So Jell-O had been declining?
*  Jell-O had been declining because all packaged foods had been declining.
*  So working at General Foods, what I was working with was the best food company in the United
*  States in 1950.
*  But I was working at it in the 80s.
*  And so it was a sense of taking these older products and making them relevant to people
*  that weren't using them all the time.
*  So what was the corporate culture inside you that you brought to General Foods that maybe
*  was missing in a company in decline?
*  And where did you get that individual corporate culture from?
*  Well, I was a poet, but I needed a job.
*  So I went to business school, I got an MBA, and I ended up in marketing at General Foods,
*  which was a highly analytic company with a very military organization.
*  And so it was absolutely fantastic at managing existing businesses with the maximum of efficiency.
*  What they were not good at was in a sense re-conceptualizing a business that was in
*  trouble because they would simply try to do more or less of what they had done before.
*  My advantage, and when I was an entry level person, I was really at a disadvantage being
*  a creative person.
*  I was very good at numbers so I could fake my way through.
*  But with each promotion at General Foods, actually the particular skills I had, which
*  was in a sense of I'm very good at, I don't know, I mean, re-conceptualizing things, taking
*  a solution that people have had, breaking it apart and creating a new solution.
*  And so I essentially brought creativity that was completely in command of the numbers,
*  if you can understand.
*  That's a very fairly rare combination.
*  And I was able to transform several businesses there.
*  So given your General Foods success, why do MBA programs so completely neglect the humanities?
*  Well, it comes from two reasons.
*  One is that the American educational system ignores the humanities and secondly, our larger
*  culture ignores the humanities.
*  So if you go to business school, you are with the most practical people you'll ever hang
*  around with.
*  In fact, I like business school and I like my colleagues at business school because they
*  were people that just wanted to get things done.
*  They were very down to earth, unlike Harvard Graduate School and comparative literature
*  where I had come from.
*  The problem is they are not people generally with a broad knowledge of history of the humanities
*  and they're not terribly creative people.
*  So did your poetry converge or diverge with your work at General Foods and this military
*  organization?
*  Well, my poetry was transformed by working in business.
*  It probably could have happened at other companies too, but if you think about this,
*  most poets in the United States have been in school since they were six.
*  At 65, they're still in school.
*  Their whole vision of the world is of a school room, of a university.
*  I was basically working with very intelligent, non-literary people for 15 years.
*  In the same way in Washington, DC, I was working with highly intelligent, highly competitive,
*  non-literary people.
*  It changes your sense of language.
*  It changes your sense of the audience.
*  I think I would have been a worse poet had I not gone into business and in a business
*  school.
*  Another reason why I was probably good is that I suffered in a way because I was working
*  10, 12 hours a day doing this other thing and then I was squeezing my writing into late
*  nights and weekends.
*  I do believe, as the jazz musicians say, you've got to pay your dues.
*  If your art isn't so good that you're willing to suffer for it, willing to sacrifice for
*  it, you're not getting deeply enough down inside you.
*  You left Harvard in 1975?
*  Yeah, 1975.
*  I was in business school until 77 and then I was in the corporate world for 15 years
*  and then I quit.
*  Actually, that's the weird thing is I worked all the way up to the top and just when I would
*  have made some good money, I just said, I've only got one life to lead.
*  It was complicated reasons because as I think you know, I lost a son and it changes your
*  perspective on what you want to do for a life.
*  I just walked out and my colleagues were baffled.
*  They have to give an explanation that makes sense to them.
*  Apparently what people were telling in the company was, Joya has cancer.
*  He just doesn't want to tell anybody because they couldn't understand why you would walk
*  out of it when you sort of have made your whole way up one step from the top.
*  Then I finally had to give them an explanation they could understand.
*  I said, I'm going to teach, which I wasn't really going to leave to teach, but they all
*  understood that.
*  One of these days I'm going to quit and teach at Harvard Business School.
*  That was a fantasy that a lot of them had.
*  It was time to reinvent my life.
*  The first time when you quit Harvard, what was the straw that broke the camel's back?
*  What was the final thought in your mind where you realized, I need to get out of here?
*  I realized that the two teachers, I took my best teachers at Harvard and they fell into
*  two camps.
*  They were older men who had served in the military in World War II and that had given
*  them a kind of reality index about what the purposes of literature were.
*  My other two teachers, Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Fitzgerald, whom I write about in this
*  book were people who basically came to teaching very late.
*  They had made their living as writers and it was only when they were sort of old and
*  kind of lacking funds that they ended up teaching.
*  I realized that while Wallace Stevens hadn't been in the university, T.S.
*  Elliott hadn't been in the university, I could make a living as a writer somehow some other
*  way.
*  I just felt that being in the university was making me as a poet too self-conscious.
*  I was writing poems to be interpreted rather than to be experienced.
*  Why is there so little good American poetry about business and the office when business
*  is such a big part of American life?
*  I think there's two reasons.
*  First of all, people tend to write out of their life experience and that life experience
*  is nowadays mostly academic.
*  Secondly, business and money are the only two obscene topics left in American poetry.
*  You can write specifically about sexual acts or excrement in American poetry and be praised,
*  but if you write about business, you're considered somehow polluted.
*  I think even the business people who are poets, and there's been about a dozen, 15 of them
*  are really quite famous, starting with Stevens and Elliott to people like Dickie and Eberhardt.
*  Those people tend not to write about their experience because they know that it will
*  essentially earn them criticism from their peers.
*  What do people who work in marketing, what might they understand about your poetry that
*  other people would not?
*  I don't think that people in marketing would understand my poetry better or worse than
*  other people.
*  I know this.
*  It's not a speculation.
*  It's a deeply rooted observation.
*  My poetry is written for people with broad life experience.
*  The older the audience, the better the audience.
*  The more diverse the audience, the better the audience.
*  Rather than writing for people who essentially are working in a code ... You know the tribe
*  of economists.
*  The tribe of economists have certain rituals.
*  They get around the fire.
*  They do their economist dance.
*  They offer their economist sacrifices.
*  They sing their economist chants.
*  Poets are the same way.
*  I'm not really interested in talking to them exclusively.
*  My desire has always been to write a poem that my fellow poets will say, gee, that's
*  really well made.
*  work, but is really registered to speak to a broad mix of humanity.
*  There's an assumption in the university that the common reader, the average person, is
*  stupid.
*  I hate to say this in public, but the center of human intelligence, the epicenter of human
*  intellectuality is not the English department.
*  The English department has right people.
*  It has dumb people.
*  It is a reflection of humanity in general.
*  I meet intelligent people in every profession I go to, including people that are in manual
*  labor.
*  I meet extremely reflective and intelligent people.
*  That's the life that they have found themselves in.
*  I know that because I am the first person in my family to go to college.
*  I was raised around working class people, many of whom did not speak English as their
*  native language.
*  My family on both sides was full of really intelligent people.
*  And I do not want to exclude those people from the work that I write.
*  Do you like Auden crave a social function for poetry?
*  I think poetry has a social function, but it's a relatively complicated and subtle one,
*  The reason that we have art is in a sense to increase human happiness.
*  It does that essentially on an individual level.
*  A work of art awakens you to the possibilities of your own potential.
*  It takes that potential, it enlarges it, it refines it.
*  Each art does it in different ways.
*  Music appeals to the auditory sense, a kind of organizational formal structure in the
*  mind.
*  Painting is visual.
*  Sculpture is visual and tactile.
*  In the old days, people always would feel sculptures.
*  Poetry is to our language and our emotional functions.
*  They awaken emotions and awaken our ability to articulate them.
*  Now that's on an individual basis.
*  When you do that on a social level, what you create over time, if you have the arts
*  there, are people who are better aware of who they are, how they feel, are able to articulate
*  it and recognize that empathetically in other people.
*  So I would say that a purpose of poetry on a social level is to enlarge our empathy and
*  understanding of one another.
*  What are the prospects for a culture that no longer understands poetry and might that
*  be ours?
*  I think we see it everywhere around us.
*  We see a coarsening, a stupefaction of language.
*  We live in cliches, we live in news bites.
*  If you look at the size of an article in a newspaper, it's probably one third of what
*  it was when I was in college.
*  The New Yorker even, probably has one quarter as many words that were not as comfortable
*  working with words.
*  And where you see it most clearly, I did a lot of work at the NEA in terms of American
*  literacy.
*  And I had never understood how we measure literacy.
*  But it's a very simple thing and I can explain it in about a minute.
*  In a test that measures high levels of literacy, I say Tyler says that coffee is good.
*  Dana says coffee is bad.
*  And the question is, is coffee good?
*  Is coffee bad?
*  Is there a disagreement?
*  And most people will check good or bad.
*  They cannot, because of their, in a sense, inadequate linguistic training, they cannot
*  recognize contradictory statements in a larger logical structure.
*  Which means that we've lost our ability to make even basic distinctions and refinements
*  in terms of thought.
*  So I feel that, now there's another whole thing which is different from this that I'll
*  be happy to go into, but I don't want to talk too long on this.
*  Will there be ever a great long poem again?
*  There might be, but it will take a very different form.
*  And why did they stop appearing?
*  So Harry Potter is a long book, or the series of them is long, you put them all together.
*  Lord of the Rings, the three volumes, they're fairly long.
*  Why aren't poems long anymore?
*  Well it was interesting, in the modern movement, and I'm talking about maybe 1914 to the Second
*  World War, there was a huge transformation in all the arts.
*  Music, sculpture, painting, literature.
*  And art became, in every form, more abstract, more conceptual, more formal, not in the sense
*  of Rhyme and Meter or whatever, but in terms of these kind of structural designs.
*  As part of that, there was a general bias against narrative.
*  Putting a story in was somehow condescending to a stupid audience.
*  But the fact is, humanity needs stories.
*  People lead their individual life as a story, and one of the reasons you need lots of stories
*  is that in every life, your story comes to an impasse.
*  You have to, in a sense, revise the narrative of your own life.
*  And so what fiction does, what poetry does, what narrative does, is give you a wealth
*  of narrative possibilities so you can recognize that no matter how bad your life is right
*  now, that there's an escape, there's a rescue, there might even, in the Greek sense, be a
*  Deus Ex Machina, an intervention which saves you.
*  I believe that the suicide epidemic in the United States, the opioid epidemic in the
*  United States, especially among young people, is among people who cannot, in a sense, get
*  control of the stories of their own lives.
*  So the deprivation of narrative, of stories, the cheapening of narratives in our mass culture,
*  I think has had tremendous human cost, both in the loss of creativity, loss of productivity,
*  and also, at its worst, in terms of suicide, drug use and death.
*  Is rap music simply the new poetry?
*  It's very popular.
*  It is poetic in some broader notion of the term.
*  Rap, hip hop, without any question, is poetry.
*  It is rhythmically structured words, you know, moving through time.
*  So you have in the invention of rap, rap is interesting because, once again, if I go back
*  to 1975 when I was leaving Harvard, I was told by the world experts in poetry that what?
*  Rhyme and meter were dead.
*  Narrative was dead in poetry.
*  Poetry would become ever more complex, which meant that it could only appeal to an elite
*  audience and, finally, that the African-American voice in poetry rejected form, rejected these
*  European things and would take this experimental form.
*  So what the intellectuals in the United States did was we took poetry away from common people.
*  We took rhyme away.
*  We took narrative away.
*  We took the ballad away.
*  And the common people reinvented it.
*  The greatest one of these was Kool Herc in the South Bronx, who invented what we now
*  think of as rap and hip hop.
*  And within about 10 years, it went from non-existing to being the most widely purchased form of
*  popular music.
*  So we saw in our own lifetime something akin to Homer, the reinvention of popular oral
*  poetry.
*  There were parallels in the revival of slam poetry, cowboy poetry, and new formalism.
*  So in every little social group, people from the ground up reinvented poetry because the
*  intellectuals had taken it away from them.
*  Why is Elizabeth Bishop a more radical poet than Ginsburg or Ferlinghetti?
*  Well, she's radical in that she went back to the roots of poetry.
*  And she kept rhythm.
*  She usually kept rhyme.
*  And she understood that poetry wasn't simply a formal structure.
*  It was a form of wisdom literature.
*  When I review books of poetry, I ask myself three questions.
*  What is the writer doing?
*  What is the writer trying to do?
*  Secondly, how well does the writer do this?
*  But then there's the third question.
*  And this is where Elizabeth Bishop really wins.
*  How worthwhile was the thing that they wanted to do and they did?
*  And sometimes you see people do marvelous jobs of something that's not really worth the effort.
*  What Bishop tried to do was to explain in her poetry, and this is what great poets do,
*  what it is like to live in a particular life, in a particular moment, and make you feel
*  the pain, the joy, the illumination, the doubt with the absolute intensity as if it were
*  happening to you.
*  As you must know in the main Bishop biography, it suggested she was not such a popular professor
*  at Harvard.
*  Yet you loved studying with her.
*  What accounts for that difference in perspective?
*  I think actually it was my memoir that really brought this to light is that nobody wanted
*  to take her classes.
*  So she was not a popular poet.
*  She was not prestigious.
*  And Harvard students are absolute barometers of prestige.
*  They can feel it and they gravitate towards it.
*  I liked her.
*  She was a bad teacher.
*  There's no question about it.
*  She was a bad teacher.
*  But you were in a room with a great poet who had no pretensions at all.
*  She says, I am a bad teacher.
*  And you would just talk about poems.
*  You would look at them.
*  You'd feel the material.
*  And there is no substitute for a young artist to the experience of being in the presence
*  of a master.
*  My brother Ted, who's a famous jazz historian, jazz critic, he played piano with Stan Getz.
*  Stan was a very difficult guy, but he was one of the great jazz geniuses in the last
*  half century.
*  And just seeing how Getz worked, how Getz performed, how Getz conceived of things was
*  like a university degree.
*  And the same thing for me with Bishop and Robert Fitzgerald.
*  I was with two of the greatest craftsman poets of their generation and sometimes twice a
*  week.
*  It was transformative to me.
*  Much better than an organized lecturer.
*  Is memorizing poetry a good way to learn it?
*  Memorizing poetry is the only way to learn poetry.
*  Who is the mother of the muses?
*  Nemno sign, the goddess of memory.
*  You don't understand poetry until you learn it by heart.
*  Think of the metaphor of learning it by heart, putting it into the very center of your being
*  and making it part of you.
*  And that's when and only when you understand how most of poetry's meaning is indirect,
*  is intuitive, even physical.
*  What do you think of learning every single character in a long epic poem?
*  I thought it was hard work because Robert Fitzgerald made us learn every character and
*  every long poem.
*  And we're talking about hundreds of people with Greek names or Italian names.
*  But what it does do is show you that every moment in a great work of art contributes
*  to the total effect.
*  That none of these things are accidental.
*  Everything has meaning.
*  Putting yourself aside, where are the conservative poets today?
*  Why is there not a modern say T.S. Eliot or Cummings?
*  Well there are poets.
*  I mean there's three ways of saying conservative.
*  Is it conservative politics?
*  Is it conservative aesthetics?
*  Is it a conservative cultural vision?
*  There was an avant-garde composer named Lou Harrison and he had his motto which was consider,
*  conserve, create.
*  And the whole notion seems to me of art is of conservation.
*  Of looking at all the achievements of the past and figuring out what it is we save and
*  what it is that we need to add to move forward.
*  The trouble with that in terms of the academic culture is that there's one or two trendy
*  ways that they think are important because they generate work that validates you for
*  for tenure versus having real deeper cultural values.
*  So the really great, is it worth, poets who are conserving culture.
*  One of the greatest ones just died, a fellow named Richard Wilbur.
*  You felt with Wilbur when you were reading these wonderful poems that everything that
*  was worthwhile and usable in the past somehow found a place in these poems.
*  And I think that's what it is.
*  In the same way you would not in mathematics or science or economics throw out everything
*  before you.
*  You would take it and you would build on it to make something that was meaningful for
*  the moment.
*  Elliot had suggested that Virgil was the first poet to in some aesthetic sense actually belong
*  to the Christian world.
*  Do you agree?
*  Well, you can't understand early Christianity, oddly, without understanding Virgil.
*  Virgil in one of his ecologues claimed that there was a king being born in the East who
*  would save the world.
*  Now he was talking about apparently a possible heir to Augustus, but the Christians took
*  this as essentially a prophecy.
*  And they developed a view of Virgil and of classical culture which I think saved Christianity.
*  I'm a Catholic.
*  I think this is fundamental to Catholicism, which says that there is the supernatural
*  inspiration, but there is also a kind of natural prophecy, a natural inspiration.
*  And so using Virgil, they were able to save the entire classical tradition as an alternate
*  way of thinking about the world, articulating the world, and they assumed this.
*  They consumed and digested this to form Catholicism, which is why Catholicism has such a strong
*  philosophical, theological, and artistic tradition.
*  Now Hermann Bruch, as you know, he wrote the famous novel The Death of Virgil.
*  He was a Catholic.
*  Is that coincidence, accident?
*  Well, you know, Bruch is one of these fascinating characters, and he takes a single moment in
*  Virgil's life, the very last moment.
*  Virgil, like Kafka, at the end of his life, felt that he had failed as an artist.
*  He had not finished certain things in Aeneid, so he requested that his great epic.
*  And you have to think of this, the Aeneid is the central poem of Western literature.
*  People forget this now because, you know, we go back to Homer, we have Dante, we have
*  everything else, but it was the Aeneid was what formed essentially the imagination of
*  Christian Europe and that he's going to burn this.
*  And so Bruch takes him and turns him into an existential hero having an existential
*  crisis, which indeed might have been true.
*  Luckily, Kafka's friend Max Brode and Virgil's friends refused to follow the poet's wishes.
*  Toward the end of that novel, he has a dialogue with Augustus, right, the emperor.
*  So let's say you're that poet, you're on or near your deathbed and you're having a
*  dialogue with Augustus.
*  What do you tell Augustus?
*  Thank God you were here.
*  I mean, Augustus is that brief moment where you think that the Roman imperial system,
*  might work and Augustus much more than our rulers today, understood the cultural power
*  of art.
*  Now postmodernists, they defame Augustus, they defame Virgil, Horace saying that they
*  were pawns into imperial power.
*  But I think Augustus had a broader vision as did Virgil, which is to say, if you can
*  give people a common story, it unifies them.
*  And a culture in order to keep together an empire, a nation in order to keep together
*  has to have certain common myths that express, convey the values, not in intellectual terms,
*  but in terms of story, emotion, image.
*  Now I know you're a big admirer of Auden as a poet and a writer.
*  He once said, and I quote, opera is the last refuge of the high style in poetry.
*  True or false?
*  True with a vengeance.
*  I mean, I am not invited to come in and rewrite TV shows.
*  You know, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese don't call me to work on their screenplays,
*  but in opera, they still need the poet because they need language and stories that are elevated,
*  concise and lyrical.
*  How good are Auden's libretto?
*  So we did one for Stravinsky, one for Henssé, right?
*  For Britain, he did Paul Bunyan.
*  Well, here's the thing you learn from Auden.
*  His greatest libretto in terms of poetry is his first one called Paul Bunyan, which made
*  an absolutely terrible opera because it was so well written you couldn't do anything with
*  it.
*  What he did as he went forward, the libretto became less poetically distinguished and more
*  dramatically powerful.
*  So I think his greatest libretto, I think his best two are the two that he wrote for
*  Hans Werner Hänse, The Elegy for Young Lovers and the Bacchae, the Basarites.
*  Unfortunately, in The Elegy for Young Lovers, Hans Werner Hänse was in his 12 tone period
*  and the opera is un-listenable.
*  But the libretto is a truly great libretto.
*  The Basarites, the Bacchae is a great opera.
*  It's one of the three or four best operas of the last 50 years.
*  So having studied opera librettos and written quite a few of them yourself, how is it you
*  feel you have a deeper appreciation of Auden?
*  Well, Auden has always been a good role model because, you know, Auden, I mean, think of
*  Auden understood that if you were in the 18th century and you were a poet, you were writing
*  lyric poems, ballads, verse epistles, satires, you were writing plays, you were writing song
*  lyrics, you were writing all of these things.
*  And he did not allow himself as a poet to become hyper specialized.
*  Where most poets today, all they write are pieces of typography that are roughly one
*  page long.
*  Now, you can write great poems that way, but I did not want to have a poetic life that
*  was restricted to a narrow genre of the lyric poem written to be read silently on the page.
*  And so Auden gave me the permission, as it were, to write libretti, to write song lyrics,
*  to work with jazz musicians, to do translations, to do long poems, and to also, and this is
*  what Bishop did too, to work in any style I wanted to.
*  You see this assumption right now that a poet finds a voice, a style, and they just
*  keep working in that same vein their whole career.
*  Where I think that you should, you know, be open to any possibility of genre, of style,
*  of form.
*  So, when you write a libretto for Nosferatu, as you've done, is that German expressionism?
*  Is that an American poetic style?
*  Is that Catholic?
*  Or how do you place your own libretto?
*  Tyler, it's all of them.
*  Because what I did with Nosferatu, Alva Henderson wanted to write an opera with me, but I couldn't,
*  he had an idea and I just didn't like the idea.
*  So I said, let me come up with an idea.
*  And then I happened to meet a film historian, he died a few years ago, a wonderful guy named
*  Gilberto Perez, he was a Cuban, and he had gone back to the original cut of Nosferatu,
*  which was about half an hour longer than the one anybody, you know, people see.
*  And when I saw it, I said, gee, this reminds me of a 19th century opera, because it's not
*  about the vampire, it's about the suffering of this woman who's trapped in this tragic
*  drama.
*  And what is opera except the suffering of people with high voices?
*  And so I was able to take the Murnau film, which he had stolen from Bram Stoker, he couldn't
*  get the copyright, so he borrowed it.
*  But then he overlaid Wagner.
*  And so I took that and I overlaid my own concerns.
*  So the opera is a kind of expressionist opera, but which uses a lot of bel canto conventions,
*  and it's deeply, deeply Catholic.
*  I didn't intend it to be Catholic, but somehow when you're talking about the nature of evil,
*  your theological assumptions come to the fore.
*  I was mostly wanted to be dark and sexy and fascinating in its sinister quality.
*  What is the most difficult or most scarce skill in writing opera librettos?
*  Taking it seriously, I can't tell you how bad most libretti are, most contemporary libretti,
*  because there's this assumption, which is that, well, you know, you just write something
*  and the composer does all the work.
*  That's not true.
*  An opera needs to be as well written as a Broadway musical.
*  And if you go to a Broadway musical, if you go to a Cole Porter musical or a Stephen Sondheim
*  musical, much of the pleasure is in the language.
*  And I've had this experience again and again when they produce the operas I've written
*  the libretti for, the singers come up to me and they go, your lyrics are so good.
*  Now what does that mean?
*  I think it means this.
*  When I was writing a poem for the page, all it had to do was to work on the page.
*  But when I write lyrics for an opera libretto, it has to work as a poem.
*  It has to work as something that the composer can set to music, which means it has to be
*  tight enough to have a form, but not so tight that the composer can't get into it.
*  But there's a third thing that I had never considered.
*  The singer has to become your words for the duration of the performance.
*  The soprano walks on, she has to know who she is, who she was, what she wants.
*  She has to inhabit your words.
*  And that's what I think I got to be very good at, creating beautiful language that a singer
*  could inhabit in the way that they can inhabit a great pop song.
*  What do you think of the libretto for Jerome Curran's Showboat?
*  Well I think if you go to these classic musicals like Showboat, they have tremendously fine
*  lyrics.
*  And Annie gets your gun.
*  Who wouldn't have wanted to write the lyrics for that show?
*  I don't find that as much in contemporary musicals, and I don't find it hardly at all
*  in contemporary operas.
*  Opera is what Wagner called a Gesamtkunstwerk, a combined artwork.
*  It combines stagecraft, poetry, music, acting, etc.
*  If you have one element of that combination that doesn't work, the whole doesn't work.
*  In the same way that if you have a singer with a bad voice, opera doesn't work.
*  I think that writing great lyrics is what makes a lot of musical theater from opera
*  to cabaret either excellent or lousy.
*  Was Joseph Kerman correct to suggest the Tristan was Wagner's greatest, most integrated work
*  as a whole, in part because of the synthesis of ideas, music, lyrics, history?
*  In abstract I agree with him.
*  I do think that there was a problem with Wagner.
*  I've always wanted to write an essay, I've never written it, called Slow Time Versus Fast
*  Time.
*  And I would take Verdi's Rigoletto, where he just rushes through this thing and it puts
*  you in an emotional frenzy.
*  And Rigoletto is about as long as one act of Tristan, where Wagner slowed down time
*  to give you a very different, almost hypnotic effect of the music.
*  So one's emotional excitation, the other is a kind of hypnotic trance.
*  And I feel that that hypnotic trance, it goes too slow and parcival.
*  But for me, I think something like Die Valkyrie and even these early operas like The Flying
*  Dutchman, Afriken der Hollander or Lohengrin, do it in a time frame that I find more natural
*  to my own body rhythms.
*  That being said, Tristan and Isolde is a masterpiece.
*  Is it plausible to believe that Verdi's Othello is a greater work, even dramatically, than
*  Shakespeare's Othello?
*  It's certainly the equal of Shakespeare's play.
*  And it has things that Shakespeare does.
*  It has a thing called the credo, where Iago comes in and does a blasphemous parody of the
*  Catholic credo, which is I believe in one God, and he believes in a God of evil.
*  And this is a moment, a theatrical moment, that just staggers you.
*  In the same way, her Ave Maria, Desdemona's Ave Maria staggers you.
*  So I think it's an equal work.
*  It's hard to compare across genres.
*  But Othello, I think, is the greatest of all the many distinguished Shakespearean operas,
*  Falstaff being a close second, Falstaff also being a gerontologist's miracle.
*  This opera that Verdi does when he's 80 is a masterpiece, and it is different from his
*  earlier operas.
*  And it is clearly better than The Merry Wives of Windsor.
*  Not even a comparison in that case.
*  How good a lyricist is Brian Wilson?
*  Pretty good for what he did.
*  The Wilson family is from my hometown of Hawthorne.
*  And in fact, my uncle Giacomo, many years ago, was called in for a carpentry assignment that
*  he thought was ridiculous.
*  He came and he said, I had the stupidest thing I've ever seen today.
*  This guy, he made me pull out his rug and build a sandbox for his living room.
*  That guy's crazy.
*  And so we said, what's his name?
*  He says, oh, Wilson.
*  I have that.
*  But I think the Beach Boys' greatest songs from almost a decade are among the high points
*  of American popular music.
*  And they are, at this moment, especially valuable because they are, in some ways, the purest
*  expressions of a kind of personal and collective optimism that America had about, in a sense,
*  the goodness of life.
*  And we've lost that to our detriment.
*  For me, a lot of those songs are quite tragic and melancholic.
*  And that's what I enjoy about them.
*  That there's the shiny surface, but underneath, my goodness.
*  Yeah, but anything that reflects life, I mean, there's a Latin phrase which is et in arcadio
*  Even in Eden, in Paradise, in Arcadia, I am, which means death.
*  So these Renaissance painters would do these beautiful landscapes but put a little skull
*  under a bush somewhere that you could see.
*  And so I think that all great happy art has an undercut of sadness.
*  And any artist has to, in a sense, reconcile the sorrows, the sadness of it.
*  Now, in Brian Wilson's case, that becomes an increasing theme.
*  And I think eventually a kind of paralyzing theme for him, quite literally.
*  Is Brian Wilson still great in the 1970 to 73 period, say from Sunflower to Love You?
*  Or do you think by then he's fallen apart?
*  He's become a different kind of artist.
*  And I think that if you love an artist, you are interested in everything they do.
*  I don't think that the late work, that later work is the entry point into Brian Wilson,
*  versus his transformation of the popular song and his creation of a kind of genre.
*  Also, he did as much as any artist in terms of creating a vision of California,
*  which is to say a vision of California as the American dream.
*  This is what the great historian Kevin Starr did in a seven volume
*  History of California, explaining that.
*  And I asked Kevin why he never did the last volume, because he ends in the early 60s.
*  And he says, he didn't have the heart to have the dream fall apart.
*  As a Californian, I guarantee you, it has happened, alas.
*  You still live there, right?
*  Well, this is where I'm from.
*  I'm the last Jew to leave Nazi Germany.
*  I mean, this is my home.
*  And this is where I know every tree, I know every bird, where I'm part of the history of it.
*  And so it's still a wonderful place to live.
*  I mean, don't get me wrong.
*  But the detrimental aspects of California economically, culturally, educationally,
*  have been so extreme in the last 15, 20 years.
*  It's heartbreaking for people here.
*  Were the Three Stooges funny?
*  They certainly were when I was a kid.
*  In fact, I still rather, you know, I'll watch 15, 20 minutes of the Three Stooges every time I can.
*  But I prefer Buster Keaton and Laurel and Hardy.
*  WC Fields or not?
*  I adore WC Fields.
*  Bank Dick is a great movie.
*  I watch, I think my wife, you know, just rolls her eyes because if there's a WC Fields movie on,
*  I'll watch it till the end.
*  I mean, what's the one?
*  It's a gift, you know, where he's trying to sleep on the balcony and the salesman goes,
*  is Carl LaFong here, capital L, small E, capital F, small O, small N, small G.
*  And, you know, WC Fields milks that thing for about five minutes.
*  And it's wonderful.
*  But I didn't understand when I was young that both Laurel and Hardy and WC Fields,
*  the fundamental comic idea under them is how thwarted we are getting through the ordinary business of our day.
*  You know, when I was young, I just saw the jokes, the, you know, the slapdash elements of it.
*  But now I understand there's a kind of existential humor under this where WC Fields can't get a cup of coffee without trouble,
*  can't take a nap without trouble.
*  Which is the most underrated art museum in the world?
*  Oh, it's a hard one.
*  I think it's probably the Hermitage because you can never see two thirds of the art.
*  And so, and there's usually some huge portion that's out on loan somewhere.
*  So who can actually assess, you know, how magnificent, even after they, you know, they sold it to Lisbon and Washington, D.C. in large quantities.
*  It's this great unknowable museum.
*  The finest really small museum.
*  And that's perhaps what you asked.
*  I mean, the museum that nobody goes to is this weird gallery at Bob Jones Junior University.
*  Bob Jones, for years, simply bought old masters when they were $700.
*  And he has this incredible collection, or he had, he's dead now.
*  The university has this incredible collection of Italian Baroque art, which they don't really want people to come in and see.
*  And in fact, when you go there, they have a warning sign that's saying, you know, you have to understand that these paintings exhibit some of the heresies of the Catholic Church or have, you know, these terrible Catholic tendencies.
*  But you go there and it's just chock-a-block with this stuff.
*  And no one's ever seen, you know, I mean, very few people get it.
*  It took me a long time just to be able to get into it.
*  I've never been able to get into their chapel to see the art there.
*  Now, we were together in Paris, I think it was 2005, and the topic of Hieronymus Bosch came up.
*  And you knew off the top of your head the location of each fully intact Bosch painting in the world.
*  It took you about five seconds to realize the final one was in Lisbon, right?
*  Temptation of St. Anthony, as you may recall.
*  How was it that you knew that?
*  Well, as a kid, I still know this weird stuff.
*  As a kid, I was hungry for beauty.
*  And so I went to the Hawthorne Public Library, which is a monument to the good effects of political graft.
*  Somebody was on the take.
*  And so they built an enormous library and they put 10 times as many books as Hawthorne needed.
*  And I read and studied everyone in art.
*  And so I would go there and I would make lists of these things.
*  And I am still to this day, you know, most of my trips are to see art museums.
*  And I see them again and again and again and again.
*  When I went to the last trip I took internationally with Madrid and I took my kids there as well as a nephew.
*  And they thought I was crazy.
*  Every day I was in the Prado or I was in the Baron Tyson von Bonamitzvah day after day after day.
*  And I said, you know, I mean, there's not that much else I want to see there, but I want to see the Bosches.
*  I want to see the Bosches again and again, the Berasques.
*  And so to me, it's my pleasure.
*  And I like I love going to these forgotten museums that have one or two great paintings.
*  And I one of the things I really want to do is I want to go back to Detroit to see their Museum of Fine Arts, which is one of the greatest collections in America.
*  And usually when you go there, half of it's closed.
*  It's like the Hermitage.
*  And so you have to go there a couple of times to be able to see.
*  And they also have, you know, they have one of the great Breugels there.
*  But anyway, so I love this and I feel that I'm a verbal artist, but there is an extraordinary intellectual, emotional and spiritual power that the greatest paintings have.
*  And so, and you can, if you put themselves in their presence, they unlock and awaken things inside of you.
*  Let me give you one other fine museum people don't know about, which is the in Balboa Park, which is arguably the most beautiful public space in California.
*  There's this ugly modernist building, tiny, awful little thing in this awful little moat that is a blemish on the entire park.
*  It's the Timken Gallery, which is only six rooms and every room is full of fantastic paintings.
*  And when I'm there, there's usually three or four other people there.
*  People don't know about it.
*  You know, I thought you.
*  And there's a Bosch.
*  There's a Bosch there too.
*  The Huntington, I thought you might say the Gulbenkian in Lisbon.
*  You know, the Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City.
*  I love the Roerich.
*  Yeah.
*  I guess that's technically a museum.
*  We used to do a reading series in the Roerich Museum and I loved it because you were surrounded by the paintings of this Russian mystic.
*  And it almost looked as if you were doing a production meeting for Lost Horizons in terms of describing Shangri-La.
*  The Huntington is the, you know, is the greatest collection of English paintings outside of England and it's on 200 acres of gardens.
*  So it's, you know, it's, it's wonderful, but it's pretty well known.
*  So a lot of people have never been there because it's not in downtown Los Angeles, right?
*  If you're a tourist, it's a bit of a.
*  Certainly crowded when I go there.
*  You know, I, you know, I have a house in South Pasadena now.
*  So when we're there, my wife and I, uh, who are members of the Huntington.
*  And as you probably know, I have donated my archive to the Huntington library, which is one of the great American institutions.
*  Also one of the great stories of American culture I've given them my archive, but we go there walking in the mornings and it's extraordinarily beautiful.
*  Also great for bird watching and all the, all the plants and flowers pretty much, if you find it are labeled.
*  So you'll see thousands of plants and flowers.
*  Putting aside whatever one might think of contemporary art, take that as a separate issue, but what is the main thing wrong with Western art museums today?
*  Well, right now, American art museums, Western art museums are going through a destructive period of self doubt.
*  Now, if you think of what a museum is, a museum is a conservation technology.
*  I mean, the museum is a relatively modern, uh, creation.
*  It really happens only after the French revolution.
*  When they decide that, uh, that when they grab the, uh, the emperor's urban palace, which is the Louvre, that they will bring all of the art that they've taken from the aristocracy and the, and the royalty.
*  And put it there and allow people to come in.
*  They also created the earliest version of the NEA because they took the upper apartments and they gave me the free rent for artists.
*  After a number of years, they realized that was a bad idea.
*  That's a whole separate topic.
*  And then because of that, the, um, Habsburg empire emperor in Vienna said, well, I should let my people come in and see my collection.
*  And then it happened, you know, began to happen to the Uffizi in Florence and in Madrid, but we have this creation.
*  So you look at this, it's really only slightly more than 200 years old.
*  And what we're trying to do is to preserve the best of the past and let people into it.
*  Museums today now say, well, we are vehicles of cultural change.
*  We don't want to be hemmed down by the past and things like this.
*  I think it's a misunderstanding of their basic function.
*  There are things, there are art spaces for this.
*  There are exhibitions, there are galleries.
*  There are Kunsthalls in German, it's a wonderful term, an art hall.
*  No collection, but we exhibit art there.
*  That's where that should happen.
*  And it breaks my heart to see museums sell their best paintings to raise money, to, first of all, cover the deficits of their own bad management.
*  And this has happened, you know, the Albright Knox in Buffalo did this shamefully ahead of everybody else.
*  You know, the Berkshire Museum did it shamefully, but now it's universal because they need money and to buy works that are more socially proactive.
*  And so I think that if they want to buy socially proactive works, have their board, buy them.
*  Don't sell your existing collection because these places will never be able to get them back.
*  If you walk to the men's room in most museums, there's a lot of blank white space on the wall.
*  Should they be putting pictures out there?
*  That's a cultural question.
*  Probably not.
*  I think, first of all, because it's not honorable, rightly or wrongly.
*  But secondly, it's nice to have white space in the museum to give your eyes a break.
*  How would you restructure the Vatican Museum?
*  Oh, God.
*  Talk about the Hermitage being inaccessible.
*  You know, no one sees the Raphael rooms, the Raphael stanza.
*  I think what the Vatican should do is to take their Pinacoteca, which is their gallery, and probably their classical collection and create a new museum outside of the Vatican.
*  The physical structure of the Vatican cannot support the millions of people that visit there.
*  Because if you think about this, in most years, Rome is the most widely visited tourist location in the world.
*  And the Vatican is the number one attraction in Rome.
*  And so it makes it makes St. Peter's and everything else inaccessible.
*  But I do think that they should build a new museum for the core of their collection.
*  And, you know, they could raise a lot of money that and take better care of the art.
*  Is Andy Warhol an effective Catholic artist?
*  It depends on what you mean by a Catholic artist.
*  He is a Catholic artist in that he recognizes the power of the iconic image and the incarnational quality of art.
*  That being said, if you ask, you know, how, you know, that last thing about what he does so well, is it worth doing?
*  I'm not sure a lot of it is.
*  So I think of him as a kind of eccentric, brilliant, eccentric artist.
*  And the Catholicism gives a certain weight to his art.
*  But he would not be on my short list of great artists of the 20th century.
*  What is the most significant work by Ray Bradbury?
*  I think Ray Bradbury for 10 years wrote a series of books, almost at the rate of one per year, that transformed not only American science fiction, but American popular culture, including two tremendously interesting novels, Fahrenheit 451 and Martian Chronicles.
*  I think his greatness, however, is in his short stories.
*  If you took his 10 best short stories, things like Sound of Thunder, Pedestrian, and they are extraordinary.
*  They create a kind of sensibility that then became encoded in our culture through the Twilight Zone that expanded the possibilities of American literature.
*  What do Martians have to do to seek redemption?
*  That's a question Bradbury asked, right?
*  Well, this is.
*  The illustrated man, fire balloons.
*  What we asked.
*  With pure energy.
*  So what can they do?
*  We asked our eighth grade nun if there were people on the other planets, would they have to get baptized and would they go to heaven and hell?
*  And she answered the question brilliantly, I thought.
*  She says, well, if there are people on other planets, if they fell the way Adam and Eve did, would they go to heaven and hell?
*  She says, well, if there are people on other planets, if they fell the way Adam and Eve did, they would need redemption and God would need to redeem them.
*  So the first question we have to ask, have the Martians, are they an unfallen race?
*  And I think generally we've looked at the Martians as an unfallen race.
*  They are the noble savage.
*  They are the Edenic creatures, except in H.G. Wells.
*  What do you view as the implicit theology of the original Star Trek series?
*  Is it in fact secular as it pretends to be or not?
*  I think of it as Jungian.
*  And, you know, what it is doing is creating the archetypal journey of the young hero towards discovering his own strengths, part of which is finding his
*  anima and his animus.
*  And what Darth Vader is, is clear.
*  I mean, it's almost as Jung on his uniform.
*  He is the shadow of the hero's personality and the hero has to confront and eventually control or even his shadow.
*  So I think it's a Jungian work rather than a Christian work.
*  Why is Olaf Stapleton an important writer?
*  That's not a question I expected.
*  How could you not expect that?
*  Well, you know, first of all, I hope people know who Olaf Stapleton was.
*  Tremendously influential, rather clumsy, visionary early science fiction writer who wrote novels like Odd John and The First and Last Men.
*  What Olaf Stapleton did was I think he was the first really great science fiction writer to think in absolutely cosmic terms beyond human conceptions of time and space.
*  And that essentially created the mature science fiction sensibility.
*  I mean, if you even watch a show like Expanse now, you know, it's about Stapletonian concerns.
*  He was also a Hegelian philosopher, as you know.
*  You know, my friend Dan Wang thinks Last and First Men is better than Starmaker, though virtually all critics prefer Starmaker.
*  Well, you know who?
*  Michael Lin, the political writer and historian, is, you know, Stapleton is one of his formative writers.
*  And so, you know, he's, you know, I think, well, Starmaker is kind of an evolution of First and Last Men.
*  Odd John is kind of the odd, you know, the first great mutant novel.
*  Did Anthony Burgess ever write a truly great book or was he always falling short in some sense?
*  That's a real good question.
*  I love Anthony Burgess.
*  When I interviewed Burgess in about 1977, I think, no, no, about 79, I told him, I've read 19 of your books and he said, that's too many.
*  And what you have with Burgess is you always feel he's on the verge of his great novel.
*  I think that perhaps Earthly Powers was his great novel because he takes the form of a Somerset Mawn novel and he overlays a mafia novel, a religious novel, a buildings roman, all in that.
*  And I think it works.
*  I think it works from the first page to the last page.
*  I think, isn't the first thing like, I was in bed with my catamite when the papal nuncio rang.
*  For me, it's the memoir that I think is best, which strikingly is not a novel.
*  I think he would have been better off had he not been a novelist and done something else and written.
*  Anthony Burgess is like D.H.
*  Lawrence. D.H.
*  Lawrence is without question a great writer.
*  The question is, did he ever write a great novel?
*  He wrote great short stories, but most of the novels have problems and Burgess is the same way.
*  But the fact about Burgess is that almost every page is alive.
*  And I've read Enderby, Inside Enderby, the Enderby novels three times and they never failed to sort of amuse me.
*  Clockwork Orange I've read maybe three times.
*  But I think you're right.
*  I mean, but I think Earthly Powers may be a good thing.
*  His biography is stunning in his self criticism and his self discovery.
*  Plus the interestingness of his life.
*  Is Georg Lukas an interesting thinker?
*  Who?
*  L-U-K-A-C-S.
*  Maybe I'm not saying the Hungarian correctly.
*  Oh, Lukas.
*  Lukas.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Lukas is the to me the most interesting Marxist critic, except for Marx.
*  And what Lukas understood was, Lukas wrote a book, which I think has one of the dullest titles you can imagine called History and Class Consciousness.
*  And in History and Class Consciousness, Lukas gave a kind of an analysis of institutional history that fundamentally is one of my
*  basic concepts in understanding the world.
*  He says that humans create an institution.
*  You can say it's the legal system for a social use called justice.
*  And as the legal system develops and develops and begins to find a way of becoming internally consistent, it has less and less to do with justice.
*  Because it's more concerned in the sense about being a self contained, rational enterprise.
*  And I think the literary studies in the university reached this point maybe 50 years ago, where in creating internal cohesion and internal structure, they had less and less to do with literature and almost nothing to do with the human purposes of literature.
*  So for that, and also Lukas's analysis of the 19th century novel is fantastic.
*  I reread him a few weeks ago in his discussion of Tolstoy and Balzac.
*  And I found it absolutely illuminating. His piece on Dostoevsky too.
*  What's your favorite Tolstoy short story or short fiction?
*  Death of Ivanović, which I think, well, first of all, if you asked me who was the greatest fiction writer who ever lived, I would say Tolstoy.
*  And his short stories are full of masterpieces, but the Death of Ivan Ilić is simply
*  one of the greatest considerations of human mortality and human limitation that I've ever read and reread and reread again.
*  I might say Haji Murad though, because Ilić is such a linear tale and Haji Murad is the satire going on.
*  It's all about historical construction of reputation, deflating egos.
*  It's a masterpiece and no one's, not no one, but very few people have read it.
*  But Master and Man is another one.
*  But my family does a thing every year where we pick a book and we all read it together.
*  And we did Dostoevsky's The Idiot.
*  Right now we're reading Kuzanbet by Balzac.
*  We did The Red and the Black.
*  We did Catch-22.
*  But we all agree that the greatest thing we've ever read together was Anna Karenina.
*  And it just nothing else can hold its own against the greatness of that novel.
*  I have a few questions about Catholicism.
*  Why is singing less central to Catholic worship?
*  Well, Catholic worship,
*  this is a limitation, was really about chant originally.
*  It was about the people who were performing the rites of the sacrifices, chanting,
*  and the people around them chanting.
*  It was in Latin, which became increasingly distant from the vulgate of the various populations.
*  And so by the time that the Reformation came around,
*  there was this great gap between, in a sense, a sacramental religion
*  and what the Protestants invented, which was a charismatic religion.
*  Catholicism has never really caught up with that.
*  If Catholics suffer for their sins by going to mass and hearing the music.
*  How is that shaped Catholic poetry, that different musical tradition?
*  Well, Catholic poetry is completely shaped by the sacraments.
*  And the sacraments are outward signs that symbolize inward changes or inward turns of grace.
*  Which means that a Catholic sees everything that happens in two ways,
*  in a physical way and a metaphysical way, in a temporal way and an eternal way,
*  with all of the mysterious connections between that.
*  And we even up to my generation, and even some of the younger ones, we were raised with Latin,
*  which means that we hear when we speak English, the echoes of an ancient language.
*  And so there was a continuity in Hawthorne, California, hometown of both Dana Joya and Brian Wilson.
*  When I was growing up between a working class kid there and the court of Augustus Caesar and Virgil and Horace,
*  the language spoken by the Roman legions in Palestine was not particularly different
*  from what was being recited and sung in hymns in Hawthorne, California.
*  That was a cultural gift that was at least as good for me as getting a Stanford BA and a Harvard MA.
*  What is the strongest presence of Catholicism in the American fine arts today or recently?
*  Movies. The Italian American filmmakers like Coppola, Scorsese,
*  Cimino, in a sense, brought a Catholic worldview,
*  you know, a dark Catholic worldview into American popular culture, you know,
*  things like Mean Streets, The Godfather, The Deer Hunter.
*  How about Catholic Asian cinema? So John Woo, right?
*  The films in the 90s, highly Catholic, very successful.
*  I find them interesting, but they don't speak to me in theological terms.
*  How about Park Cheon Wook, right, old boy? Sin, redemption, suffering?
*  Well, they are, but the question is,
*  is when you begin and you locate your films in hell,
*  how do you get out of it?
*  And I don't necessarily find those films having convincing redemptions.
*  You know, and I don't think we're redeemed by the blood that we ourselves spill.
*  The Sopranos, Catholic TV show or not?
*  The characters are Catholic, but that's not the same thing, right?
*  It's slightly. When I saw the Sopranos and I saw the guy was named David Chase,
*  I said, how can this happen? This guy knows Italians from the inside.
*  Then I saw his name was, you know, was it Chiasa or something originally?
*  He's an Italian, actually went to Stanford.
*  I find them from absolutely 99.9% on the mark of Italian Americans.
*  But most of the religion is scrubbed away.
*  In the first season, when the mother was still alive,
*  you sort of saw the darker side of Catholicism in her.
*  But after a while, it becomes a very
*  Italian American film with the emphasis of a series with un-American,
*  the way Italians have changed in America.
*  But Tony meeting the end he does, visiting the therapist is like going to confession.
*  Isn't there Catholic symbolism throughout it for what, all seven seasons?
*  Yeah, but it's no, it is.
*  I mean, it's not it is Catholic, but he is going to a psychoanalyst
*  with whom he has a sexual attraction.
*  And so it becomes Americanized in that way.
*  You know, versus mean streets is Catholicism straight up.
*  The deer hunter is Catholicism straight up.
*  The Godfather, you know, the, you know, first, you know, Godfather one and two,
*  even in number three, he tries it doesn't work very well.
*  These are fundamentally sacramental works of art.
*  In fiction, where I think the Godfather is psychoanalytic rather than sacramental.
*  In fiction, has America outsourced its Catholicism to other nations,
*  such as Elena Ferrante, Hulebeck,
*  Canals Guard is Lutheran, not Catholic, but it's still quite a confession.
*  We have a tremendous Catholic culture in American fiction
*  that was largely done by converts
*  or people that were sympathetic.
*  Willa Cather, who was not Catholic, wrote, you know, Death Comes for the Archbishop,
*  maybe the best Catholic novel in American literature.
*  But you have Flannery O'Connor, you have Walker Percy,
*  you have John Kennedy Toole.
*  You have these you have these people that are largely Southerners.
*  So they were the part of Catholicism that was a minority,
*  in some ways, a discriminated minority against the South.
*  Or you have converts.
*  We have several really fine Catholic novelists right now.
*  Tobias Wolff, Ron Hanson,
*  Alice McDermott, you know, are the three best ones, I think.
*  But there's a kind of reinvention of this.
*  But we are not a mainstream cultural voice yet.
*  And astonishingly, you know, we even have
*  a revival of the Protestant novel, which I sort of thought had died with Updike
*  and Cheever with Marilyn Robinson, who just is an extraordinary
*  who would have thought you'd have a Calvinist
*  series of Calvinist masterpieces.
*  How did Catholicism shape the work of Sigrid Unset?
*  Well, once again, I think it's a.
*  It's.
*  A Scandinavian Catholic is in the minority,
*  and what it did with Unset is, in a sense, brought her back to pre-Protestant
*  Scandinavian culture, which I think
*  was she was able to be both ancient and modern, medieval and modern.
*  And so I think she was able to bring more of the Scandinavian character
*  together in her novels that, you know, that way.
*  An interesting one that you mentioned, though, is Wellbeck, you know,
*  Wellbeck is it because he is all of his novels essentially take place
*  in a kind of hell, a secular hell of modern Europe,
*  which has eradicated its roots.
*  And you see him in the in the recent work trying to get out of it.
*  And the only way he can is, in a sense, by a leap of faith.
*  You know, I think in a funny way, it's Islam that he admires
*  for standing up to the system and saying no.
*  Yeah, no, it is. I mean, the novels are novels of existential despair.
*  So it's not surprising that they become novels of existential resistance.
*  I mean, he is our version of Camus.
*  I find him a fascinating novelist.
*  You know, I'd always heard nothing but terrible things about him.
*  Oh, he was the most it was the most awful writer in Europe today.
*  And I, you know, then I read a novel of his and I just said,
*  it's like once again, it's D.H. Lawrence.
*  It's not a great novel, but there's a great vision in this.
*  There's tremendous energy in this.
*  And they are intellectually enlivening books.
*  And so I now have read everything.
*  And I also like to I love to see him interviewed because he is a wonderful interview.
*  I mean, he just play when you see him play with the BBC
*  and reduce the BBC into a shivering mass of excuse me, Jell-O.
*  How has being a Catholic influenced your management style?
*  Well, Catholicism gives you a very sensible piece of advice.
*  You must love everyone, but that doesn't mean that everyone's perfect.
*  And so you have to, in a sense, manage
*  love, a community, togetherness, shared responsibility
*  with an ability to criticize people so they can transcend
*  their current state and become better versions of themselves.
*  With the background that is both Mexican and Sicilian,
*  do you feel closer to those varieties of Catholicism?
*  And if so, does the American version of Catholicism leave you a little disappointed?
*  Yes, and yes.
*  I'm a I'm still a working class guy.
*  You know, my Catholicism had been, you know, I go through a lot of stuff.
*  And when I came to Washington as an appointee, I was living downtown in the in the Landsberg.
*  I have renting a room and I began to go to mass at St. Patrick's.
*  And I was in a church where one third of the people were homeless.
*  One third were like me, overeducated guys.
*  And one third were the hotel service workers that were Latin Americans.
*  And when I was there, I it was truly a religious reawakening for me that, yes,
*  we were all together in this society and in this life.
*  And so I've I belong to two parishes, one in South Pasadena, which my wife prefers,
*  which is upper middle class, highly educated, very prosperous.
*  And the one in Santa Rosa, which I prefer, which is complete shambles.
*  It's working class, lower middle class people, very Mexican, very Filipino.
*  And those are my people.
*  And so I like sort of ground level Catholicism.
*  And I believe that my church is the Church of the Poor.
*  The Church of the Immigrant.
*  Where are we still building great cathedrals?
*  No.
*  Why not?
*  The I guess we can blame Mies van der Rohe.
*  But modernist architecture created this notion of functionality.
*  Form follows function.
*  And so you see the United States is full of dreadful churches, but the function of a
*  church is different than what architects think.
*  I know many people who have come to Catholicism because they were in France.
*  They walked into Chartres, Mont Saint Michel, and something happened in them
*  that they did not understand.
*  They felt something happening inside this space that was not happening in the outer
*  world.
*  And that is the purpose of a cathedral.
*  A purpose of a cathedral is to bring you into a space in which spiritual
*  contemplation experience is possible.
*  Transformation is possible inside those walls that are not going to happen
*  generally outside.
*  And now we simply have functional things that they're comfortable seating,
*  comfortable lighting.
*  And we might as well be in the Elks Lodge.
*  Now you were chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts for what, six, seven
*  years?
*  Yes, seven years.
*  Seven years.
*  What is it you think you understand about Congress that maybe outsiders would not
*  given all that experience?
*  Because one thing you were very successful at doing was appealing to Congress for
*  what you wanted to get done.
*  Well, when I was appointed to this job, people said, go there and fight, you
*  know, fight the good fight.
*  And everybody just told me, just go there and fight.
*  Don't give up.
*  And I knew instinctively that fighting was the wrong metaphor, that my job was
*  to reconcile.
*  And so they would say, how can you deal with so-and-so?
*  He's such an awful, evil person.
*  And I said that I believe everyone in Congress is the valid elected official.
*  They are the person that their people have sent to represent them in a
*  democratic republic.
*  And therefore they deserve the respect that the system itself deserves.
*  So I met with everybody.
*  I took meetings with people who only took the meetings so they could yell and
*  scream at me.
*  And I said, you know, I had the people that supported me, the people that wanted
*  to support me, and the people that I would convince to support me.
*  And within a year, because I traveled every week with people back to their
*  districts, to their states, I had created a bipartisan bicameral majority.
*  And it was because I also changed the NEA so that we were representing for the
*  first time in the history of the agency, all of America.
*  We were reaching every community, every population versus an institution that
*  was largely serving the artistic elite.
*  The arts world was very angry about that, but that is the best thing that I did in
*  my chairmanship was to make this institution which reflected America.
*  Should we send 40% of the NEA budget to the state arts agencies?
*  Yes.
*  Can't you all spend it better?
*  The right person under the right circumstances might spend it better once,
*  but generally you're better off getting it closer to the people, to people that
*  are, and also you've got 53 state arts agencies, which means you've got 53
*  different strategies.
*  And you start to see the advantages of the federal system where different people
*  try different things, and then they learn from each other.
*  How can we make arts funding less bureaucratic, whether public or private
*  sector?
*  I think the best arts funding is from the private sector, and it's where people
*  give money while they're still alive so they can measure the results of what
*  they're doing.
*  I believe that people should fund things in their own communities and they should
*  become very actively involved.
*  If you think about this, the people who create wealth have skills, they have
*  organizational skills, they can recognize when something is working and
*  what's not working.
*  If we could take some of that energy and bring it into local arts
*  organizations, we wouldn't have the number of symphonies and museums and
*  opera companies and theaters that are going bankrupt right now.
*  I see a lot of people who have a lot of money not willing to give their time or
*  not willing to give their money while, I'll give it when I die, I'll create a
*  little foundation for myself.
*  I just finished rereading a book on Henry E. Huntington, who like Andrew
*  Carnegie, Andrew Mellon, did it while they were alive.
*  They oversaw the things and they created, in the case of Carnegie, hundreds,
*  thousands of institutions, but in terms of Mellon and Huntington, institutions of
*  absolute world quality that transformed the cultural landscape of the country.
*  That transformed the cultural landscape of their region.
*  We don't see that much anymore.
*  When people do this, they tend to do it in medicine or science, not in the arts.
*  I have just a few basic questions to close.
*  First, if someone wants to pursue Dana Joya as a poet, what should they actually
*  go out and do?
*  What's the first act they should take?
*  The first act they should take is learn how to spell my name, which is not
*  self-explanatory in the anglophonic world.
*  I think just go to DanaJoya.com, which is my website, or even better yet, just go
*  to YouTube, put in Dana Joya poems or Dana Joya.
*  One of my sons is a filmmaker.
*  I've done about 20 short films with him.
*  I mean, some are only one or two minutes long.
*  You can hear my poetry.
*  You can hear some lectures.
*  Yesterday, in fact, I put up an 11-minute lecture on Robert Frost.
*  We're doing these things.
*  He believes, and I believe, he's the one that goads me to do this, is that we need
*  to find a way of speaking about poetry in our culture.
*  It's not happening in the universities.
*  It's not happening in the mass media.
*  So to do really good short films on poetry, I think, has a tremendous cultural value.
*  I've done one of these podcasts with your brother, Ted.
*  Obviously, you know Ted.
*  He's the smart Joya.
*  If you had to explain in as few dimensions as possible how your aesthetic outlook
*  differs from his, what would you boil it down to?
*  The sad thing is it's almost identical.
*  I think I've had some...
*  I don't believe that.
*  I discover some new thing.
*  I talked to him and he's discovering at the same time.
*  I think, you know, he is interested in popular culture.
*  I'm most interested in high culture.
*  And so I think that leads us into different things.
*  The art forms that he's interested in are hardly more than 100 years old.
*  The art forms that I'm interested in are as old as humanity itself.
*  And so chronologically, you know, we're listening.
*  So you think about his art, in his view of culture, it tends to be horizontal
*  because he's looking at, you know, maybe 20 years in terms of hip hop or something like this,
*  across the thing, where mine is more vertical.
*  I'm going all the way back to Virgil, to Homer, to Horace, to Dante.
*  Now, I've sometimes described you to my friends as being an information billionaire.
*  Now, these questions and answers, we didn't prepare any of them in advance, did we?
*  No, no.
*  In fact, you know, I was delighted.
*  They were such good questions.
*  I'm usually asked the same 10 questions and you did not ask one of them.
*  That was a relief.
*  So if there's someone young and bright and they want to also become an information billionaire,
*  what non-obvious advice would you offer?
*  Yes, read a lot of books, go to art museums.
*  Yes, of course.
*  But what's the non-obvious insight you have into this process?
*  I don't think you can give people advice to this that don't have the inclination.
*  But I think part of it is to pay attention to what interests you,
*  not into this kind of novelty-driven commercial culture we're in.
*  I mean, my students, and I would ask them, how long do you spend each day looking at tweets?
*  And they say, oh, about 90 minutes, about this.
*  Plug yourself out of the daily ephemeral culture and immerse yourself into things that are going
*  to be still there 10 years later, 100 years later.
*  And so I think the distractions for younger people today are so extreme
*  that they learn very little about the past.
*  And therefore, they learn very little about the present because you can't understand anything
*  unless you have a point by which to judge it, a point of perspective.
*  Very last question.
*  What do you seek to learn next?
*  If I were young, it would be Russian.
*  What I'm doing right now is actually to go back and to relearn a lot of things that I
*  had before.
*  I just finished writing a 14,000-word essay on Charles Baudelaire that's going to be the
*  introduction to a new edition of The Flowers of Evil.
*  I knew Baudelaire's work, but spending several months re-reading absolutely everything
*  was to me illuminating and joyful.
*  So I plan to do this for a couple of other people.
*  Poe, who I know pretty darn well, Samuel Johnson, and Wordsworth.
*  Because I think I can, in my own work, both as a prose writer and as a creative writer,
*  I can learn from them.
*  And my main goal right now is to finish a long poem that I started a few years ago,
*  which sort of stopped about a third of the way through so I can finish that.
*  Again, everyone, the new book is Studying with Miss Bishop, Memoirs from a Young Writer's Life
*  by Dana Joya.
*  Dana Joya, thank you very much.
*  It's been a real pleasure.
*  Tyler, this was fun!
