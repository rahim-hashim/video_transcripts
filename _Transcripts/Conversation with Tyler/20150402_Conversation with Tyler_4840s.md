# Peter Thiel on Stagnation, Innovation, and What Not To Name Your Company  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 02, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_yJTCDU4uE)
*  Good afternoon.
*  Thank you for joining us today.
*  My name is Carrie Conco and I am Senior Vice President at the Mercatus Center here at George
*  Mason University.
*  It's my pleasure on behalf of the Mercatus Center to welcome you to the first of a series
*  of conversations with Tyler.
*  Today's special guest is Peter Thiel.
*  The Mercatus Center is the leading university-based source of market-oriented ideas.
*  Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems, bringing scholarly
*  research to bear on the most pressing issues facing our country today.
*  This series of conversations will bring together world-class leaders who will talk about how
*  cutting-edge research and applied economics can be used to fix the problems we face in
*  society.
*  I'd like to take a moment to thank the members of the Media Relations team and the Events
*  Strategies team who have made today's event possible.
*  I'd also like to thank Tyler Cowen, whose vision guides not only the Mercatus Center
*  but this series of events.
*  It's my pleasure to get to introduce Tyler today.
*  Tyler Cowen is the Holbert L. Harris Professor of Economics at George Mason University.
*  With his colleague at George Mason, Alex Tabarrok, he is the co-founder of the popular economics
*  blog Marginal Revolution.
*  He is also co-founder of MarginalRevolutionUniversity.com, an innovative space for learning and teaching
*  economics online.
*  Bloomberg called Tyler America's hottest economist.
*  Foreign policy has named him to the global top 100 thinkers.
*  The economist named him as one of the most influential economists of the past decade.
*  For those of us who've had an opportunity to have a conversation with Tyler, we know
*  that his mind is an ever-changing kaleidoscope.
*  We can discuss the NBA, arts, music, literature, even economics, and sometimes public policy.
*  I'm really pleased to share him with you today.
*  And with that, Tyler, I'd like to invite you to start the conversation.
*  Just a minute on the premise of this series.
*  It's been my view for years now that Peter Thiel is one of the greatest and most important
*  public intellectuals of our entire time.
*  And throughout the course of history, he will be recognized as such.
*  So I thought Peter would be absolutely the perfect person to inaugurate this series.
*  Peter himself doesn't need an introduction.
*  He has a best-selling book.
*  His role in PayPal, Facebook, Palantir, many other companies is well-known.
*  Peter is a dynamo.
*  There is no one like Peter.
*  But the purpose today is to focus on Peter's views as a public intellectual.
*  And the way we run these dialogues are a bit different than usual.
*  It's not going to be chatty and drawn out.
*  We'll try to replicate a kind of conversation Peter and I would have with each other.
*  So get right to the point.
*  A lot of quick back and forth.
*  And we'll see how well we can do that in public.
*  But I've watched a lot of interviews with Peter online, and we're going to try to make
*  this different from all those.
*  So let's start with some questions about stagnation, Peter.
*  And at any point, if you care to add other topics of your own, please do so.
*  You're well-known for arguing, well, they promised us flying cars and all we got is
*  140 characters.
*  Technological progress has slowed down.
*  How is it you think that we're most likely to get out of the great stagnation when that
*  happens?
*  Yes, I think there are, there always are three separate things.
*  There's question of stagnation, which I think has been a story of stagnation in the world
*  of atoms, not bits.
*  I think we've had a lot of innovation in computers, information technology, internet,
*  mobile internet in the world of bits, not so much in the world of atoms, supersonic
*  travel, space travel, new forms of energy, new forms of medicine, new medical devices,
*  et cetera.
*  So it's sort of in this two-track area of innovation.
*  There are a lot of questions of what has caused it, and I think maybe that's a good part to
*  start in terms of what gets you out of it.
*  On a first cut, I would say that we've lived in a world in which bits were unregulated
*  and atoms were regulated.
*  And so if you are starting a computer software company, it costs you maybe $100,000 to get
*  a new drug through the FDA, maybe on the order of a billion dollars or so.
*  And if the FDA were regulating video game technologies and you had to do a double-blind
*  study to make sure that the video games weren't addictive, damaging to your brain, these things
*  are very overdetermined.
*  It's driven by many different factors.
*  And my narrow attempt to get out of it is not necessarily to come to DC and beg the
*  regulators to be more reasonable.
*  It is to just try to find ways for people to succeed at the margin.
*  The other thing that has driven the stagnation is the hysteresis.
*  When you have a history of failure, that becomes discouraging, and so failure begets failure.
*  No halfway sane parent would encourage their kids to study nuclear engineering today, whereas
*  there are a lot of people going into software.
*  So the history of success in software is encouraging more people to go into it and drive more innovation.
*  And then the history of failure in these other areas has been very discouraging.
*  And so what I think would start would be if you've got some signal successes in other
*  areas, that can then set a precedent and you can somehow get what's been a vicious cycle
*  into a virtuous cycle.
*  And then if you have to make a prediction, which breakthrough in particular will get
*  us out of the stagnation?
*  What's your pick?
*  Well I still think there are probably the most natural ones are all these things that
*  are at the boundary of information technology and atoms, bits and atoms.
*  Artificial intelligence, biotech, AI fusions?
*  AI feels slightly overhyped.
*  A lot could happen, it feels heavily regulated, but if you've got self-driving cars, that
*  would be a significant innovation which would change a decent amount at the margins.
*  There's some regulatory challenges with it, but it's right at the intersection of the
*  kinds of things that could happen.
*  So I think the most natural hope is that information technology starts to broaden out and starts
*  to impact this world of atoms.
*  And then we're going to have this question about whether the technology outpaces the
*  politics or vice versa.
*  So what number should I keep my eye on?
*  Let's say you're going to take a long nap and I need someone to tell me, Tyler, we're
*  out of the great stagnation now.
*  What's the impersonal indicator that I should look at?
*  Well I disagree with the premise of that question.
*  I don't think the future is this fixed thing that just exists.
*  And so I don't think there's something automatic about the great stagnation ending or not ending.
*  I think I always believe in human agency and so I think it matters a great deal whether
*  people end it or not.
*  There was this sort of hyper optimistic book by Kurzweil, The Singularity is Near, where
*  we had all these sort of accelerating charts and I also disagree with that because it's
*  not just because I'm more pessimistic, but I disagree with the vision of the future where
*  all you have to do is sit back, eat popcorn, and watch the movie of the future unfold.
*  And I think the future is open to us to decide what to do.
*  And so if you take a nap, if you encourage everybody else to take a nap, then this great
*  stagnation is never going to end.
*  Is there a chance that intellectually we've become so complacent that our world views
*  have so changed?
*  Some writers have suggested the decline of mainline Protestantism has intellectually
*  changed America forever.
*  The sense of what can be accomplished or unwillingness to repeat, say, the Manhattan Project or Apollo.
*  Is it possible we're simply in that forever?
*  And it's a downward spiral and the longer you're in it, the harder it is to get out
*  and it's not really about bits.
*  It's certainly possible that it's something like that, but I do think that there's certainly
*  at the margins, there always are things that we can do.
*  And I am somewhat pessimistic about the possibility of government being a key, a place where the
*  great stagnation gets reversed.
*  And there is a sense in which a letter from Einstein to the White House would get lost
*  in the mail room today and you could not even do Apollo.
*  And even something like the SDI program in the 1980s.
*  The debate in the 80s was a dangerous first strike weapon versus a great defensive technology,
*  whereas today people would say that SDI was just this fictional thing that would have
*  never worked.
*  Again, this very odd way that our expectations have been dramatically reduced.
*  But I do think there's sort of a question about where in the private sector can you
*  coordinate things on a big enough scale.
*  And so Silicon Valley startups have been a way to do it and maybe there's some class
*  of somewhat larger companies.
*  You know, my PayPal colleague Elon Musk started both SpaceX and Tesla, which are extremely
*  charismatic businesses because it involved somewhat larger scale, complex coordination,
*  getting a lot of different pieces together to work.
*  Not as big as we could do perhaps if you had a well-functioning government, but I think
*  that's not really that realistic.
*  Given that energy prices are now so low, are you more optimistic about peak oil than you
*  used to be or do you think that's a temporary blip on the horizon?
*  You know, I'm surprised by how much they've collapsed.
*  Now I would say they are still higher than they were in 2002, 2003 on the oil side.
*  And so the jury is still very much out on how well it's going to work.
*  I think the big question is what's the equilibrium price at which fracking is really going to work.
*  We've had something like $450 billion has gone into the fracking industry in the last
*  four or five years and there's a question whether at $50 a barrel oil can you actually
*  get a positive return on that money.
*  The striking thing, even as of summer 2014 when oil was still at $100 plus a barrel was
*  even though you had these two boom stories, you had the Silicon Valley IT story and you
*  had the fracking mid-US growth story, the striking thing was always how much smaller
*  the fortunes were that were being made in the fracking industry, which led me to think
*  that somehow it was not as great an innovation as was happening on the IT sector or more
*  marginal, harder to get to work.
*  And so I think if it barely worked at $100 it will be very interesting to see how well
*  it works at $50.
*  And you Peter, tell me something that's true.
*  Well there are lots of things that are true that are going to be explained.
*  I think for example even this idea that the university system is somewhat screwed up and
*  somewhat broke at this point, this is not even a heterodox or even a very controversial
*  idea anymore.
*  There was an article in TechCrunch where the writer starts saying, oh this is a super
*  controversial and everybody then look through the comments, the 350 comments, they were
*  about 70% of my faith.
*  So the idea of the education system is badly broken, not even controversial.
*  The ideas that are really controversial ones I don't want to tell you.
*  I want to be more careful than that.
*  And these sort of halfway in between ideas that are a little bit edgier that I'll sort
*  of go out a little bit on a limb.
*  But I think like the monopoly idea that the role of every successful business is to have
*  a monopoly.
*  That's sort of on the border of what I want to say but really good ideas are way more
*  dangerous than that.
*  Let me give you my take on how I've tried to fit different parts of your thought together.
*  And again for all you listeners this doesn't have to be true.
*  It's just my mental model Peter Thiel.
*  That you're one of the bottom thinkers who takes the idea of original sin doesn't have
*  to be a theological commitment.
*  Seriously.
*  So Topiel wrote in the 19th century that America eventually would evolve to be a land of complacent
*  people because we would stop believing in original sin and sink into a kind of conformist
*  mediocrity.
*  So you've taken this to heart.
*  So the world out there is deeply weird.
*  Even though there appears to be free entry into ideas production because of renaissance
*  of art ideas.
*  The people who deviate.
*  Someone comes down on them pretty hard.
*  So there's excess conformity.
*  The original sin in people's motives gets magnified at the social level.
*  So basically there are distortions out there and everything we can see it's a kind of
*  Gnostic theology and a relatively small number of people who can see through those distortions
*  can be great entrepreneurs or can tell the truth about politics.
*  And it's all ultimately some kind of bundled implicitly theological but not necessarily
*  involving belief in God but theological perspective about the nature of people.
*  And it ends up spreading to all the different parts of society.
*  And that to me has been what ties your thought together.
*  But that's a hypothesis.
*  Let's hear your reaction to that.
*  Well let's see.
*  Well I think sort of the way original sin normally works is that it resides in individuals
*  in one way or another.
*  And so theologically I would place it much more in society.
*  And so I think society is both something that's very real and very powerful but on the whole
*  quite problematic.
*  And we always run the risk of losing sight of that.
*  I think I don't know if it's strictly the awareness of it that solves it.
*  Certainly I think there are many people, there probably are some people who are just vaguely
*  oblivious to it.
*  So in Silicon Valley I pointed out that many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be
*  suffering from a mild form of Asperger's where it's like you're missing the imitation socialization
*  gene.
*  And that's a plus right?
*  It happens to be a plus for innovation and creating great companies.
*  But I think we always should turn this around as an incredible critique of our society.
*  And we need to ask what is it about our society where those of us who do not suffer from Asperger's
*  are at some massive disadvantage because we will be talked out of our interesting original creative
*  ideas before they're even fully formed.
*  We'll notice oh that's a little bit too weird, that's a little bit too strange.
*  Maybe I'll just go ahead and open the restaurant that I've been talking about that everyone else can
*  understand and agree with or do something extremely safe and conventional and therefore hyper
*  competitive and probably not that great as an idea.
*  And so I'd say a lot of these people may not understand this larger theory about society but they're
*  somewhat oblivious to it and it pushes progress.
*  Now certainly my own experience would have been a little bit more where I think I was sort of, I grew up in
*  Northern California, it was this hyper tracked process where my eighth grade junior high school yearbook
*  one of my friends wrote in, I know you're going to get into Stanford in four years.
*  Four years later I got into Stanford, then I got into Stanford Law School.
*  You won all the conventionally tracked competitions.
*  You ended up at a big law firm in Manhattan.
*  From the outside it was a place where everybody wanted to get in.
*  On the inside it was a place where everybody wanted to get out.
*  And then you ask, one of the people down the hall from me said that it was great to see me leave.
*  I left after seven months and three days.
*  It was great to see me leave.
*  It was like I had no idea it was possible to escape from Alcatraz.
*  What did you learn there?
*  Well I learned that I was incredibly prone to this problem of social convention.
*  If you want to give it a religious terminology, it was like a, the psychological terminology would be that
*  I had a rolling quarter life crisis in my mid-20s.
*  The religious terminology had a quasi-conversion experience where I realized that the value system was deeply corrupt and needed to be questioned.
*  And so I do think that one of the ways of challenging convention is to, one way, the Asperger way,
*  is just to be vaguely oblivious to it all and continue apace.
*  And then I think there's another modality where you just become aware of how conventional our conventions really are.
*  And then that becomes sort of indirect route of trying to start thinking for yourself.
*  So in your view, perhaps the contemporary world, it's becoming, I don't know what the word would be, stranger or weirder,
*  or more shaped by individuals who are different, precisely because conformity is being piled on other places.
*  So if the movers and shakers would be people who are in some way neurodiverse,
*  then overall the world is becoming more surprising in a way, right?
*  That's what we expect at different margins and different corners.
*  And this will accumulate. It may never feel like we're getting out of the great stagnation.
*  But each bit of change we get is, in a way, a more different bit of change than we would get, say, in 1957,
*  when everything was done with guys with white shirts and starched white collars,
*  and hoping they would be able to buy a little pocket calculator someday.
*  I'm not sure whether, you know, I think the innovation that we are getting is driven in strange ways.
*  I worry that actually the conformity problem is actually more acute than it was in the 50s or 60s,
*  so that the category of the eccentric scientist, even the eccentric professor,
*  is sort of a species that is steadily going extinct,
*  because there sort of is less space for that in our research universities than there used to be.
*  And so I worry that perhaps, if anything, it's a little bit the other way,
*  but it's very hard to measure these things or calibrate them.
*  But I think that in politics, the conventional approach is to simply look at pollsters.
*  You know, what are your positions going to be? You just look at the polls. You figure this out.
*  And it works fairly well. It probably, you know, at the end of the day,
*  that's probably not how the system really changes.
*  It probably will get changed by some idiosyncratic people who have really strong convictions
*  and are over time able to convince more people of them.
*  But whether this means that we have more or less change is hard to evaluate.
*  But I think it comes, it always comes from these somewhat nonconventional channels.
*  So let's say you're trying to select people for your field fellowships,
*  or maybe to work for one of your companies or to start a new company with.
*  And just you, Peter Thiel, as a judge of talent,
*  what trait do you look for in that person that is being undervalued by others?
*  So the rest of the world out there, it's way too conformist.
*  So there must then be unexploited profit opportunities in finding people.
*  And if you're less conformist, which I'm very willing to believe,
*  indeed would insist on that being the case, what is it you look for?
*  Well, it's very difficult to reduce it to any single traits,
*  because a lot of what you're looking for are like these almost zen-like opposites.
*  So you want people who are both really stubborn and really open-minded.
*  That's like a little bit contradictory.
*  You want people who are sort of idiosyncratic and really different,
*  but then who can work well together in teams.
*  And so this is again sort of maybe not 180 degrees opposite, but sort of like 175 degrees.
*  And this is why you like Hegel.
*  I don't like Hegel that much.
*  But so I think it's, so if you sort of focus too much on one or the other end of it,
*  you'd get it completely, you would tend to get it completely wrong.
*  So I like to get things where you get these combinations of unusual traits.
*  So if you have people with some really interesting, very different idea,
*  that suggests, okay, we're sort of in the idiosyncratic category,
*  then the important question becomes, okay, would they actually be able to function socially and execute?
*  And then maybe the teamwork question you'd ask would be, what's the prehistory of this company?
*  How did you meet? How long have you been working together?
*  And if there's a long prehistory, that would be good on the other side.
*  So I think it's always getting these combinations right.
*  So there's an interview with you and someone asks,
*  what's the Straussian reading of your book Zero to One?
*  And you say something like, the Straussian reading is, don't be an entrepreneur.
*  Yet at the same time, society has this problem, which many of us would recognize,
*  that too many people go down tracks of conservative career choices.
*  You work for a consulting firm or you go to finance if you come out of a top school.
*  It's now become a new kind of conservative choice, maybe to go to Silicon Valley in certain ways.
*  And given the difficulties of becoming an entrepreneur and the pull of conformity,
*  how is it actually socially, what kind of intellectual or ideological reconstruction do we need
*  to get people out of so many of these conservative career choices?
*  It's hard to say. So I think entrepreneur is sort of one of these very odd terms
*  where people will say, you'll ask somebody, what do you want to be doing in five, ten years?
*  Oh, it's very clear, I want to be an entrepreneur.
*  But it's just this vague, empty term. It's like, I want to be rich, I want to be famous.
*  And so I am actually quite skeptical of that as a term.
*  And so, yeah, I think I did say the Straussian reading of Zero to One was that perhaps you should not,
*  I had the adverb in, perhaps you should not be an entrepreneur.
*  And it was because on one level, the book is advice about how you would go about building a business.
*  But then on some level, you could also read every single chapter as discouraging people
*  from going into business potentially as well.
*  So if you give the core advice that you should start a business that's going to be a monopoly,
*  and then you say, well, that's really discouraging a lot of people who don't have an idea for a monopoly.
*  And so maybe they shouldn't be starting businesses.
*  So my view is we should be starting more good businesses and fewer bad ones,
*  not more businesses in the abstract, not more startups in the abstract.
*  And yes, there is always this psychosocial bubble question.
*  I don't think we're in a tech bubble today like we were in 99-2000.
*  I actually do not think the public as a whole is involved in quite the same way.
*  And so I'm not worried about it like I would have been in 99-2000.
*  I had someone email me a question. Let me read it off. Tell us what you think.
*  This is a quotation. Quote, what do you suggest a well-educated but zero marginal product worker
*  in his mid-30s should do to remake himself for the next 30 years?
*  Well, I'm always super hesitant to answer questions that are so abstract.
*  If there was some general answer to the question, it would almost certainly be wrong.
*  If I gave you some general answer and everybody could follow it,
*  then if everybody followed that answer, it would be the wrong thing to do.
*  Certainly there are, there still seems to be strangely a shortage of people in IT, broadly.
*  You can actually get, if you're reasonably talented, you can get training in software,
*  in coding in a fairly short period of time, and get an employable job.
*  And it's sort of an odd cultural thing in our society where we still think of computer programming
*  as such a geeky, bad career choice for people that even after a decade in which it's worked surprisingly well,
*  there probably are still far too few people going into it. So that would be a, I think that's a safe general one.
*  Petroleum engineering is probably, that's the other amazing one that has not yet attracted more people into it
*  in spite of a decade-long boom.
*  If you think of the cultural achievement of mankind or at least the United States,
*  or maybe just your own California, and you ask the question, has that too seen a great stagnation?
*  Or is artistic creativity still reaching new and higher peaks?
*  What's your view there? Just how general and pervasive is this phenomenon of stagnation?
*  If it's intellectual in its roots, you might think that it's applying to everything.
*  I think it's very hard to measure in a number of these dimensions.
*  I think artistic things, things that are of a very qualitative nature, are hard to measure.
*  I certainly think Hollywood's producing fewer great movies relative to 20, 30, 40 years ago.
*  On the other hand, there are a lot of good TV shows. What's your favorite TV show?
*  It's all sort of this crazy, schlocky stuff like Game of Thrones. I don't watch that much TV.
*  I think there are a lot of things like this that work.
*  It's hard to measure. I think the technology and science questions are ones that I find very interesting.
*  I think they're somewhat more measurable than a lot of the qualitative social ones.
*  I suspect we're not innovating as much in those dimensions either.
*  I think that one you just end up projecting your own biases onto society.
*  In the back room, we were talking about Japan and a recent trip of yours to Japan.
*  Maybe you'd like to relate some of what you were saying.
*  They always want you to say things that are sort of contrarian and surprising.
*  They asked me this discussion I was giving in Japan.
*  The answer that I came up with, which was both flattering to the audience,
*  but somewhat disturbing from our perspective, was I think we always think of Japan
*  as this hyper-imitative, non-creative culture of extreme conformity.
*  My suggestion is that perhaps at this point, Japan is the least conformist,
*  the least imitative country in the world.
*  There's actually a lot of interesting aesthetic, cultural stuff going on.
*  There's still a lot of very successful types of businesses.
*  There's innovation in food production, all sorts of interesting areas.
*  But then it's an indictment of the West, where I think Japan is no longer the Japan
*  of the Meiji restoration of the 1870s or the Japan of the cheap plastic imitation toys of the 1950s.
*  It's a country that no longer thinks it can get that much by copying from the West.
*  There's probably still some narrow interest in IT and software.
*  Outside of that, I think they're copying the U.S. and Western Europe less and less.
*  People aren't even learning English that much anymore.
*  I think they're speaking less English than they were 15, 20 years ago.
*  The golf courses are all getting shut down and converted to solar farms or something.
*  People don't even want to play golf anymore.
*  I think we need to take this as a real critique of our society very seriously,
*  because they're finding less that's desirable to imitate in the U.S. or Western Europe.
*  I'll name a few items, and you tell me just if you think, is this overrated or underrated?
*  Canes, John Maynard Canes, overrated or underrated?
*  Still massively overrated, but perhaps not as much as it used to be.
*  New York City, overrated or underrated?
*  That's massively overrated.
*  Why?
*  I think we basically have a 25-year boom in finance from 1982 to 2007.
*  I think that's slowly ebbing, slowly abating.
*  It's going to be increasingly regulated.
*  If you want a long, short, blue state trade, you want to be Long California, short New York.
*  The long, short red state trade, by the way, is you want to be Long Texas, short Virginia.
*  If you ask what do Virginia and New York have in common, and what do Texas and California have in common,
*  is both Texas and California are actually very inward-focused places.
*  California, both the Hollywood version and the Silicon Valley version are very focused in on themselves.
*  Texas is also a very inward-focused place.
*  What Virginia and New York, or let's say DC and New York City, have in common is that they're centers of globalization.
*  Finance is sort of an industry that's fundamentally leveraged to globalization,
*  and DC is fundamentally leveraged to international geopolitics.
*  I would bet on globalization slowly being in abeyance.
*  I think with the benefit of hindsight, we will realize that 2007 was not just the peak year of the finance boom,
*  but also the peak year of globalization, like maybe 1913.
*  Happily, it hasn't resulted in a world war, at least not yet,
*  but I think we are sort of in this period where globalization is steadily pulling back.
*  You want to be in places or industries that are leveraged to things other than globalization.
*  I tend to agree with that.
*  As you may know, before 2007, trade is going up at a rate three times higher than world GDP.
*  Post the crisis, trade and world GDP are going up at about the same rate.
*  I think in rate terms, that has peaked.
*  You see California and Texas in a way as being like Japan, and you're along Japan also.
*  That's underrated.
*  I'd be relatively along Japan.
*  I wouldn't be long France, but maybe that's even underrated because it's probably still somewhat anti-globalization.
*  The marginal tax rates probably will go down in France at some point.
*  Yes, I'd be along the things that are not as leveraged to globalization.
*  I'd be skeptical of London, New York City, places like that.
*  How about China?
*  China, it's hard to evaluate on this globalization metric because on some level,
*  the growth story is linked to exports and globalization, and then at the same time,
*  it has these capital controls and all these ways that it's somewhat separate.
*  I find it always very hard to evaluate.
*  I do think it's interesting that the questions about China are being asked less often in the US today than they were a decade ago.
*  In 2005, it was a very widespread question.
*  In what year will China overtake the US?
*  A decade later, it's reasonable to think that it's a decade closer to when this will happen.
*  It's a much less commonly asked question.
*  At the end of the day, I suspect we're underestimating China, but it may be very hard to invest.
*  I've always thought that you can only participate in the Chinese boom if you are a well-connected,
*  card-carrying member of the Chinese Communist Party.
*  I'm not, and so it's not been a place that I've really focused that much.
*  Take a place like Brazil.
*  I tend to think of Brazil as fairly inward-looking.
*  If you're on a bus in Brazil, you hear Brazilian music, typically, not American pop music.
*  You think Brazil is underrated or overrated economically, and do you agree with my characterization of it as relatively inward-looking?
*  If it's an exception, what would account for that?
*  It's relatively inward-looking.
*  Actually, one other metric for inward versus outward-looking is which countries were first taken over by Facebook
*  and how Facebook spread all over the world.
*  It started with the U.S., other English-speaking countries.
*  Then it went to all the small European countries where people spoke English, Switzerland, Holland, Scandinavian countries.
*  Then the ones that were the hardest to break into were the ones with these very separate language groups.
*  Brazil was much harder than the rest of Latin America, which had this Spain to Latin America aspect,
*  whereas Brazil is a self-contained country where most of the people in the world who speak Portuguese live,
*  and Portugal barely counts.
*  I do think it qualifies on the inward-looking piece, but if you look at the history over the last 150 years,
*  I think there have been four points where people were hyperbolish on Brazil.
*  I'm not going to get them exactly right, but I think it was one pre-World War I.
*  I think there was one in the 60s, in the 50s, in the 70s.
*  That's right.
*  There was one again in recent years, and they all turned out to be false-dons.
*  They were all linked to Brazil being tied into globalization.
*  The optimism about Brazil was always from all the potential that would happen when it became linked to globalization,
*  and then the disappointment happens when it turns out it doesn't work.
*  There was this giant energy company called OGX.
*  The guy who started it was worth $30 billion in 2011.
*  He's now worth minus $1 billion.
*  You met with him in Rio de Janeiro.
*  He had McLaren parked in his living room in a villa on a pedestal.
*  He had just divorced his wife, told me, I can now park my car wherever I want.
*  They had all these offshore oil concessions they'd gotten from the government in relatively shallow water.
*  It seemed like a fantastic investment.
*  But then it turned out you could only get Brazilian oil service companies to develop it.
*  There were no Brazilian oil service companies.
*  Maybe the oil didn't exist at all.
*  Maybe the whole thing was a giant fraud.
*  Very hard to tell.
*  These things work when people are bullish about integration and globalization, and then the reality sets back in.
*  It could be the case that it's fairly decoupled, and the excess optimism came from people thinking it wasn't.
*  You mentioned Facebook a few minutes ago.
*  In the back, we were talking about good and bad names for companies.
*  If you could tell us your view on this.
*  How important is the name of a company?
*  What are a few good names and why, and what are a few bad names?
*  I think the naming of companies is sort of like a slight aesthetic thing I believe in very strongly.
*  The names of companies are often very predictive of future failure or success.
*  I'd say PayPal was a very friendly name.
*  It was the friend that helps you pay.
*  Napster was a bad name.
*  It was the music sharing site.
*  You nap some music.
*  You naps a kid.
*  That sounds like sort of a bad thing to be doing.
*  It's no wonder the government then comes in and shuts the company down within a few years.
*  You want to be very careful how you name companies.
*  In the sharing economy context, I like Airbnb way more than Uber.
*  Airbnb sounds like this very innocent, virtual bread and breakfast, this very light, non-threatening sort of company.
*  Uber, that sort of sounds like a bad name from Germany sometime in the 1930s.
*  What are you exactly above, like maybe the law?
*  This is probably something that, again, from a government regulatory perspective,
*  I think Airbnb is a vastly better name than Uber.
*  On the social networking side, I would say that I actually think Facebook was a very good name.
*  I think MySpace was sort of a more problematic name.
*  Facebook was, you can say that all these social networks involve both reading and writing.
*  Unlike real life, you learn to, you have to write before you read.
*  You first have to write some things about yourself.
*  Then you read more about other people.
*  Over time, reading dominates writing.
*  Facebook was about learning about people around you, about the real identities at Harvard.
*  MySpace started among wannabe actors in Los Angeles,
*  and it was about them coming up with fictional narratives around themselves,
*  and then sort of a lot of other people in LA who are generally like that.
*  And because reading dominates writing, Facebook would ultimately dominate MySpace.
*  So I think you can sort of, there's a certain version where the whole arc of the company was,
*  the whole product arc was implicit in the names.
*  How about United States? Overrated or underrated? And consider the name.
*  You know, it's hard for us to have good intuitions about this because it's,
*  we're so used to it and so embedded in the history.
*  But certainly I would be, you know, this is all out ofistic and way too old fashioned,
*  but I'd be sympathetic to the 19th century spelling where the U was lowercase.
*  In chess, first move, E4 or D4, which is better?
*  You know, it's probably the case, it's probably, I haven't,
*  it's probably the case that D4 is marginally better at this point because there,
*  it looks like there's certain defenses to E4 that are very hard to break like the Berlin defense,
*  but I still always play E4. It's what I got used to.
*  Because it's the attacking move, right?
*  It's the attacking move and if you're short of a world champion level,
*  I always enjoy sort of increasing the risk and volatility in the game.
*  Now you were born in Germany, you're fluent in German, that's part of your background.
*  How do you think that's influenced your worldview, what I would call your implicit theology,
*  how the different pieces of Peter Thiel's ideas fit together?
*  What's the role there and do you still sometimes dream in German?
*  You know, we spoke German at home, we moved to the States when I was a year old
*  and we spoke German at home for the first 12 years.
*  My parents didn't have a TV set, we got a TV set at age 12 and then sort of the English language overtook everything.
*  It's hard to sort of generalize, I think California and Germany are sort of extremely opposite kinds of places
*  in certain ways and I think of California as both very optimistic and somewhat desperate.
*  So you have 20,000 people a year move to Los Angeles to become movie stars, maybe 20 of them make it.
*  So it has sort of all of California is super optimistic but somewhat desperate.
*  It's like Beach Boys music, right? Sounds optimistic on the surface but it's deeply sad and melancholy.
*  Maybe something like that, yeah.
*  And then I think Germany is always incredibly pessimistic but very comfortable.
*  And so it is this very big contrast.
*  I think it is probably, I'm not sure pessimism is generally that helpful an attitude to have,
*  but the German pessimism is probably a helpful corrective in the midst of the hyperoptimism that permeates Silicon Valley.
*  So I think that if you're a mildly pessimistic person, you might do well in a place where people are insanely optimistic
*  and if you're a mildly optimistic person, you would do well in a place where people are insanely pessimistic like say Germany.
*  So maybe you're this mix of German pessimism and California optimism.
*  Just like you said for Kiel Fellowships, you look for people who embody these then contradictions.
*  Maybe that's one of yours that the extreme pessimism has to do with the weirdness of the world
*  and the difficulty of breaking through the conformity, but at some level you think it can be done, right?
*  And you've done it.
*  So I always think extreme pessimism or extreme optimism on their own terms are not terribly healthy attitudes to have
*  because extreme pessimism tells you there's no point in doing anything.
*  Extreme optimism tells you there's no need to do anything.
*  So they sort of converge on doing nothing.
*  And so I think a healthy attitude is always either something that's milder, mild optimism, mild pessimism.
*  And I think I average out to sort of a mild version even though maybe the components are extreme.
*  But on average it comes out somewhere in the middle.
*  I was emailed this question.
*  What is your maximum likelihood estimate of when you will die? At what age?
*  You know, I think this is a...
*  I think it depends a lot on what we do about this stuff.
*  So again, it's not as though the future exists on its own.
*  But you're forecasting you.
*  What depends on what I do and what I get other people to do in the next few decades.
*  I think these things could go in very different directions.
*  I think there are...
*  Whenever I look at the science on these areas, I think there are many innovations that could happen.
*  And then I think it's incredibly slow.
*  So if I had to make a straightforward forecast, I would do a straight line extrapolation
*  where life expectancy has gone up something like 2.2 to 2.5 years per decade since 1840.
*  And so that would probably get me into my early to mid 90s.
*  And then you add maybe 10 years, so somewhere 100 to 110.
*  That would be a pretty good upper case.
*  But I think there's a lot of variability.
*  If things end up stagnant, it'll be not much more than what people would expect today.
*  If things accelerate, it could be a lot longer.
*  A lot of those gains in life expectancy have come from people younger than 80.
*  People who reached 80 in, say, 1870 did only marginally worse than people who reach 80 today.
*  In that sense, I tend to be more pessimistic about many people reaching 100,
*  though I would give you in relative terms perhaps the best chance of anyone in this room.
*  So I think that was true in the first half of the 20th century.
*  I think in recent decades, more of the gains have come from somewhat older people,
*  not necessarily from people who are 80 and up, but say people who are 60, 65, 70,
*  of being able to live significantly longer than they were in the past.
*  But you're right, we're not going to get that many more gains from reductions in infant mortality or things of that sort.
*  And so it will come from people who are somewhat older, hopefully living both longer and hopefully healthier lives.
*  What's your favorite novel?
*  The classic one I always give is Lord of the Rings, but if you want something a little bit more intellectual,
*  it's probably the Bulgakov novel, The Master and Margarita,
*  where the devil shows up in Stalinist Russia and succeeds and gives everybody what they want,
*  and everything goes haywire.
*  I'm sorry, because no one believes he's real.
*  New Testament or Old Testament, which has influenced you more and why?
*  Well, I'd have to go with something like the New Testament,
*  but I think these things are always subject to so much interpretation.
*  And so I don't think something like any of these holy books, they stand on their own.
*  If they did, that's always an anti-religious argument at the end of the day.
*  The Hebrew Bible, to me, has more of this dialectic that we found in a lot of the other topics,
*  mix of optimism and pessimism, much more irony, multiple voices, varying perspectives.
*  So my answer would be, the Hebrew Bible has influenced me much more than the New Testament,
*  which has hardly influenced me at all.
*  Now, you're different in that way, but what it is in your character or intellect or background
*  do you think accounts for that difference, given some of the other things you've said?
*  Let's see.
*  Let's see.
*  It's probably...
*  I actually disagree with that sort of characterization of it.
*  I think Christ is a very complex, very ambiguous figure in many ways.
*  It's always... which makes the interpretation quite difficult.
*  I think almost everything that Christ said could be described as an answer to something
*  that's true that most people did not agree on.
*  And I think for the most part, it was necessary for Christ to be very careful how he expressed himself.
*  It was mostly in these sort of extremely parabolic, indirect modalities,
*  because if it had been too direct, it would have been very dangerous.
*  I think it was John Locke in The Reasonableness of Christianity said that Christ obviously
*  had to mislead people, since if he had not done so, the authorities might have tried to kill him.
*  So there's a kind of Straussian Christ here.
*  That's the Straussian interpretation of Christ, which I think is at least true for...
*  it didn't end in a particularly Straussian way, but I think it was at least true for most of his ministry.
*  What do you hope to spend the next year thinking about, ideas or questions you haven't thought through already
*  that will be your focus in the next year or two to come?
*  Things we haven't talked about already.
*  Well, it's not... I don't know if it's ever really sort of this top-down agenda that I try to set.
*  A lot of what I end up doing is somewhat serendipitous.
*  You talk with a lot of interesting people.
*  You try to figure out what are some great technologies, great entrepreneurs to work with in different ways,
*  and that's how you end up getting sort of very interesting perspectives and how you change your mind on things.
*  The overarching agenda is always to try to figure out some way to get out of the stagnation
*  by literally helping people to start companies that will change the world.
*  Before we get to audience Q&A, final question from me.
*  You've done many startups, funded many others.
*  You've written zero to one on startups.
*  If you think of the Institute for Humane Studies and Mercatus Center as a kind of startup,
*  we're together in one location.
*  We have a critical mass of people here studying notions of liberty and individual responsibility.
*  We have more or less a common intellectual background in some ways.
*  I wouldn't say we have a monopoly,
*  but the space of doing liberty-oriented ideas in a university setting is by no means what everyone is jumping at doing, to say the least.
*  If you think of us as a startup embodying at least some characteristics which have something to do with what you've praised,
*  what advice would you give us at the margin for being successful in the future?
*  I think all those elements are quite good.
*  I actually think that it's always a mistake to be too focused on prestige and status.
*  This is always the great temptation in many areas.
*  I think academia is one that's extremely prone to this.
*  I would always be long substance, short status.
*  I think the temptation is to try to get more respectability within an academic setting or within some sort of a broader audience.
*  If you try to get respectability, it will always come at the price of softening the edges, modulating what you say.
*  You want to always put substance over status.
*  If that was a single overarching theme, that would be a very healthy one to maintain.
*  Thank you, Peter, very much for those stimulating answers.
*  For Q&A, we do that through lines at the mic. Is that correct, Julie?
*  If you would take your line at the mic.
*  We'll go to the first question. Please, no lengthy statements.
*  Please ask direct questions.
*  Yes?
*  I work with a data scientist here in Northern Virginia.
*  Thank you very much, Peter, for being here.
*  Thank you, Tyler, for your time.
*  My question is, you talk about vertical progress versus horizontal progress.
*  I'm wondering, how does one create vertical progress? Do you have any tips for doing that?
*  There's no formula.
*  I think there's no straightforward formula for innovation.
*  I think it's much easier to do horizontal progress, which I describe as globalization,
*  copying things that work going from one to N versus vertical progress, technology doing new things going from zero to one.
*  Globalization, I think there is actually a formula.
*  You can copy what's working. You can try to mechanically apply it.
*  I think there's something scientific about globalization.
*  There's something deeply unscientific about the history of technology itself.
*  Science starts with the number two, whereas every moment in the history of science, technology, business, I believe, happens only once.
*  The next Mark Zuckerberg won't start a social network.
*  The next Larry Page won't start a search engine.
*  I think it's always some idiosyncratic thing.
*  I think it's good to be passionate about something that you're good at that other people are not doing.
*  If you can get those three things lined up, that's a very good start.
*  Thank you.
*  This side, yes.
*  My question is very similar to the last question that Dr. Cowan asked, but from a different angle.
*  I think that what Mercatus does is not necessarily completely unique in the sense that you're competing with other people who are trying to influence minds about economic and truths related to government.
*  In order to go from zero to one in a nonprofit organization or a political advocacy group, what would one have to do?
*  What would be a key differentiator or angle to approach with it?
*  Well, the contrarian nonprofit question that I always ask is, you know, it's not the contrarian business question, what great business is no one starting, the contrarian investor question is, what great investments does nobody like?
*  The contrarian nonprofit question is, what great causes are deeply unpopular?
*  This is how I always deflect requests for money, is I ask people, why is your cause popular?
*  Why is your cause unpopular?
*  They only want to fund unpopular causes.
*  I assume popular causes are funded relatively well relative to good unpopular causes.
*  And so I think that's sort of in some sense, if you're able to push unpopular causes, that's very good.
*  And then the Zen-like problem, the paradox is that you will have a lot of impact if you're able to push a good, worthwhile, but unpopular cause.
*  The Zen paradox is that it's very hard to market it and get money to do it.
*  And so that's the tension that I think it's worth thinking through really hard.
*  I think most nonprofits fail at this, where they end up supporting things that are super conventional.
*  They can get funding for them, but if they didn't do it, there'd be a hundred other people doing it.
*  So I think always having a counterfactual sense of mission is important.
*  If we weren't doing this, nobody else in the world would be doing this.
*  And to the extent that's not true, you want to make that more true.
*  And maybe it's a spectrum, but you want to always tilt more in that direction.
*  I always, on the business side, on the nonprofit side, I always just differentiate mission-oriented businesses,
*  which have this counterfactual sense of importance, from social entrepreneurship.
*  Because I think anything that has a social element to it, I think the word social is very ambiguous.
*  It can mean number one, good for society. It can mean number two, good as seen by society.
*  And in practice, the second meaning always ends up dominating the first.
*  And then you end up with sort of the me too, lemming-like, sheep-like clones, where you lose every raison d'Ãªtre.
*  This side.
*  This is a question that a commenter named Daniel Burfoot posted on Professor Cowan's blog.
*  If he's in the room, I apologize for taking your question.
*  But his question is, in an age increasingly dominated by intellectual ability,
*  what should a person of modest cognitive ability do with his life to find meaning or make a contribution?
*  And related to that, what person of average or modest intelligence do you admire most?
*  Well, I'm not going to answer the second question, because I'm always nervous that I'd be insulting people if I did.
*  But I think that, I don't know, I think there are actually a lot of things that people can do that are strikingly,
*  that are under-explored.
*  There are certainly all these vocational careers where people can do quite well, and they're somehow considered not cool, not prestigious.
*  Sort of the average plumber makes about as much as the average medical doctor.
*  And so I do think this idea of what's unfashionable is very important as an initial anchor.
*  And there's no reason that people of average ability are going to be more pushed towards what's fashionable than people who are very smart.
*  I think often smarter people are more prone to trendy, fashionable thinking, because they're sort of more easily,
*  they can pick up on things, they can pick up on cues more easily, and so they're even more trapped by it than people of average ability.
*  On this side.
*  Hi, Peter. I'm inspired by you. I am also nervous to be here asking you a question, so please bear with me.
*  I'm going to take you on in your challenge about sharing something we know to be true that everyone disagrees with, and then ask you a question about it.
*  And the truth that I know to be the case is that the future of human evolution and how we think about how we structure society lies in privately funded, managed for profit cities built in partnership with but independent from governments today in the world.
*  My question to you, and then also I have a follow up for Dr. Cohen, is what do we need to do to enlist your powerful support in that view in addition to getting introduced by someone in your inner circle?
*  And Dr. Cohen, my question to you is what do we need to do to be on that stage having a similar conversation with you and the crowd that you have managed to get out here?
*  Thank you.
*  Well, look, I think there are many things that would be incredibly terrific to do.
*  So it's always like the business version is always, you know, is this important?
*  So yeah, if we could reopen the frontier in geopolitical terms and find a way to really innovate on society, I think this would be a terrific thing to do.
*  And then the question is how does one actually do this is very tricky.
*  You know, all the surface area on this planet is occupied.
*  It seems very hard to get this to work.
*  I know Roemer had this experiment with the city states in Africa.
*  I think it was prohibitively expensive.
*  It could never really quite get started.
*  And so you need to have some version of where this would work and you could get started with a budget of let's say less than 50 billion dollars.
*  So if you could give me a convincing way would work for 50 million instead of 50 billion, I'd be interested.
*  I got it.
*  Your question addressed to me.
*  I have a graduate student and also a colleague who are working on the economics of private cities,
*  not private cities being completely separate from larger political units, but largely private cities with mostly private infrastructure nonetheless.
*  If you're talking about private cities truly independent of government, I would call those cruise ships.
*  We do have many of them.
*  I think they work fine, but I don't view them as a significant blow for liberty.
*  And in fact, when I go on a cruise ship, I actually worry about some of the liberties I'm signing away.
*  I know I do that voluntarily.
*  It's fine.
*  I don't object to that.
*  But I tend to favor larger political units and to think that human freedom will be found by the wealth and diversity within larger political units, giving people pockets.
*  I'm not sure we'll ever have a bottom-down creation of a lot of micro units which compete very intensely and through exit give people true liberty.
*  I'm more optimistic about the larger political unit vision, but maybe that's a matter of taste.
*  But in terms of these events, you know, you or anyone else, feel free to write me.
*  Thank you very much.
*  My email is googleable.
*  And my name is Eric Bremman and the project's name is Enterprise Cities.
*  You will hear from me later.
*  This side.
*  It feels like a little bit of a follow-up, but in a 2009 Cato Unbound article, you discussed your disillusionment with democracy as a source of innovation and change in government and politics and express your interest in cyberspace, outer space, and seasteading.
*  Is there a 2015 update on how you're feeling about government and politics and innovation?
*  Writing is always such a dangerous thing, you know.
*  You know, I remember the professor once told me back in the 80s that writing a book was more dangerous than having a child because you could always disown a child if it turned out badly.
*  You could never disown anything that you've written.
*  And you know, the Cato Unbound article, it was, you know, my, it was a thousand-word essay.
*  It was late at night.
*  I quickly typed it off.
*  I sent it to someone else to review.
*  I said, oh, nothing controversial in here at all.
*  And my retrospective was that if you actually ask someone to double-check things for whether or not it's controversial, you already deep down know that you should double-check it yourself.
*  But I think, I think sort of my updated version on it would be that, you know, I sort of made the case I thought democracy and capitalism weren't quite compatible.
*  The updated version I would give is, you know, it's not at all clear that we're living in anything resembling a democracy.
*  You know, we're living in a sort of a representative republic, but then that's modified through a judicial system.
*  And then, of course, that's been largely superseded by these very unelected agencies of one sort or another, which really drive most of the decision-making.
*  And so, so that, so I think, I think calling our society a democracy, whatever may be good or bad about democracy, is very, very deeply misleading.
*  We're not, not a republic.
*  We're not a constitutional republic.
*  We are, we're actually sort of a state that's elected by these, that's dominated by these very unelected technocratic agencies.
*  And the very difficult political question is how can you get an advanced technological society to function in any way that's, you know, more republican or more democratic at all?
*  And not at all sure how that is.
*  But I think the challenges that a lot of these agencies have become are deeply sclerotic, deeply non-functioning, even though the alternatives to them politically often seem to be even worse.
*  So, you know, the Federal Reserve, lots of things they do I don't like, but then, you know, it's sort of once you get people in Congress involved in dictating Fed policy, that always seems even worse.
*  A follow-up on that, Peter.
*  New Zealand arguably is the most democratic country in the world, I would say, or very close to the most democratic.
*  Given that, New Zealand, overrated or underrated?
*  You know, again, I think it's, again, more like a representative democracy or republic.
*  But there's no constitution, there's close to only one branch of government, very little federalism.
*  Well, I think a lot of these smaller countries are somewhat underrated generally because you have sort of an adaptability, an ability to change things that's, you know,
*  that can move sort of a lot faster.
*  But I think it's, again, I don't think it's the form of government that matters so much.
*  I think it's often the culture, how well things work, to some extent the size.
*  So I think those are elements that are very positive.
*  But yeah, in a world where globalization is going in reverse, you know, one sort of rough approximation is you want to go on a place on the planet that's as far away from the Middle East as you can get.
*  And if you do that on a physical globe, it's somewhere in the southern hemisphere, and it's basically halfway between New Zealand and Tahiti.
*  And so if you had to pick them, I'd go with New Zealand over French Polynesia, which is sort of where the people in France go who find the work hours in France too onerous.
*  Tonga.
*  On this side.
*  Thank you.
*  How would you evaluate the government of the United States as an investor in innovation and technology?
*  Perhaps you would comment or consider referring to rockets to the moon, the transcontinental railroad, drug development, and solar energy, or any other innovations you care to stress?
*  Well, it's these are obviously quite, quite different.
*  And I would say I would say it's been on a on a so there's a libertarian perspective, which I have, which is that it's it's extremely bad.
*  But that's that's present tense.
*  And I think the sort of non libertarian perspective that I think we always should think about a little bit harder is that there's also been a tremendous decline where where I think in the 1930s and 1940s,
*  you had a degree of technocratic competence that was that was quite quite significant.
*  You know, you know, today a letter from Einstein would get lost in the White House mailroom.
*  The Manhattan Project would be unthinkable.
*  Apollo would be unthinkable.
*  It probably you know, I think the first signal one that really went wrong was Nixon's war on cancer.
*  And so I always do think the 1970s were this decade where many of our institutions, especially our governmental institutions, started to work much less well.
*  And that was perhaps the signal one where where things things went badly wrong.
*  And and the you know, in terms of investing in science and technology, it seems to me the minimum criterion for for doing it is to have some understanding of these things and some ability to evaluate them properly.
*  And and in a government in which, you know, two thirds of the representatives are lawyers and in which, you know, again, just using the House and Senate as a proxy for our government by generous count, no more than 35 have degrees in engineering or science or anything like that.
*  Even very any technical field, very generously defined both the House and Senate.
*  Perhaps these are not the right people to be to be driving these investments.
*  And and I think we again should have much more focus on substance, much less on process.
*  I always use the Solyndra bankruptcy as a you know, this example.
*  So this question what went wrong, the sort of a Republican process critique.
*  The process was screwed up or kicked back.
*  Somehow there was this corruption.
*  It could never quite prove it.
*  But that was sort of the intuition.
*  The Democratic defense was we had a process.
*  We had a portfolio, a financial process where we gave money to lots of different things.
*  You sort of let 100 flowers bloom or something like that and and get sort of a a sort of mathematical objection to it was that a cylinder is has two pi are the surface area of a flat panel, which would be to our and therefore is by definition one over pi as efficient as a flat panel.
*  And so it was you could just use ninth grade high school geometry to show that this was a demonstrably inferior technology was never going to be commercially viable.
*  And you have a Nobel laureate Steve Chu running the Energy Department who is not allowed to use ninth grade high school geometry in evaluating what to do.
*  And that's obviously that's sort of a society.
*  That sort of government is one that should not be allowed to make any investments in these areas whatsoever.
*  This side.
*  I Peter Joe Klingel executive director of consumers research in your in the libertarian utopia that you will build.
*  What will you use for money?
*  Will look more like Bitcoin or more like PayPal?
*  Well, I'm not exactly I'm not exactly sure that I'm going to succeed in building a libertarian.
*  This question presupposes that you do.
*  I think that I actually I actually do think that that there's a little bit too much of a fixation on this monitorous level and not enough on the on the underlying real economy.
*  And so and so I'm you know, I think that you know, I think we've got we sort of have for example, we have we have a lot of these debates about Fed policy.
*  Are they printing too much money?
*  Are they not printing enough?
*  You know, what should the Fed be doing?
*  Somehow do you decentralize that?
*  And I I don't I think money and the nature of money is somehow much less important than all the micro regulations that make up the economy.
*  So I would be if you gave me a choice of getting rid of, you know, the vast bulk of government regulations and keeping the Fed, I'd much rather do that than keeping all the other zoning laws and crazy rules we have and going with PayPal, Bitcoin, any gold, you know, any any sort of alternate currency when one could come up with.
*  So so I think that I'd much much prefer to focus on the level of atoms, the real economy than on the virtual level of bits, which I think of money as being linked to my my my my intuition for what it's worth is that you'd want you'd want money.
*  You'd want it to somehow be linked back to the real in a in a fundamental way.
*  This was this was the merit of the gold standard that it was sort of at least maintain this discipline that you know money was not something that simply grew on trees and could be printed ad infinitum.
*  And so I wanted to be linked to something real.
*  Maybe you know maybe you link it to the equity market or something something that's somewhat more real than just fiat money.
*  But again, I think I think the the much more critical thing are all the micro regulations.
*  Thank you.
*  Hi Peter. My name is Ara. I work for the Indonesian government as their advisor.
*  My question too for you.
*  First one is, do you think Indonesia is underrated or overrated?
*  And number two, what you what would you recommend for my government to fight off terrorism?
*  Because you talk a lot about monopoly in your book.
*  Is it possible for my government to monopolize information and security yet at the same time respecting the individual privacy of our citizens?
*  Thank you.
*  Well, again, I'm not totally sure if I have a great answer on that off the top.
*  I think I think that you know I think that I don't I don't know if the right question for many of these countries is what to do on the level of the country itself.
*  Indonesia has 200 plus different islands. It's extremely heterogeneous as a place.
*  I think that if things were somewhat more decentralized, that probably that probably would be would be the direction that that one would be tempted to go in.
*  You know, the I don't know all about the details of the terrorism issue in in Indonesia.
*  My my sense is that a lot of these national security debates have involved these fake tradeoffs in many different places.
*  And it's always it's always you do more with more or less with less.
*  You have more security with more privacy invasions in a more centralized, powerful state versus you have less security with more privacy sort of.
*  It's always like the NSA versus the ACLU.
*  And I think this is a this is a very fake dichotomy.
*  The technological solution I would like is where you do more with less, where we have more security with fewer invasions of privacy and we try to find ways to actually do things that are much smarter.
*  And that's what I would what I would define as actual innovation in this space.
*  But we can always we can always do more with more versus less with less.
*  And I think that's that's just sort of the boring ideological debate.
*  We're always stuck with this side.
*  So hi, Peter. My name is Yaya Osfor.
*  And my question revolves around I have also the same appetite to live longer, you know, over 100 for reasons that is correlated with my life mission.
*  So give an example like my life mission is to produce more entrepreneurs, innovators, locate ideas and leverage my full potential, you know, as a citizen in this world, health and many reasons.
*  So for you, my question is, why do you have an appetite to live longer?
*  And what's your life mission? And is that correlated with have you fulfilled your life mission yet?
*  Well, I think it's somewhat independent of a life mission.
*  So I actually just think life is a something that's worthwhile in and of itself.
*  I think death is kind of a bad thing in and of itself.
*  So even if I had even I was adrift and had no sense of what I was doing at all, I would still all else being equal, hopefully prefer to live a lot longer.
*  I always think it's very odd how how the the how sort of how weirdly strange the anti aging life extension idea is.
*  And I always think, you know, why would people think that you need a life mission or some extraordinary reason to to want to to live longer?
*  And I think part of it goes to these very strange psychological ways we deal with mortality through a combination of acceptance and denial.
*  We we we accept that we're all going to die and so we don't do anything and we deny we sort of think we're not going to die anytime soon.
*  So we don't really need to worry about it.
*  And so we have a sort of schizophrenic combination of acceptance and denial like extreme pessimism, extreme optimism.
*  It sort of converges to doing nothing.
*  And I'd like us to to just fight it a little bit more for its own sake.
*  Over here. Thanks for a good discussion.
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
*  Both of you.
*  If you accept for the moment the premise that in general, the sort of free market system we have has done a pretty fair job on the production side, but that there may be a secular threat to its success on the distributional side.
*  In other words, increased concentration of wealth, perhaps due to technology changes.
*  Is there a way to substitute something on the distributional side without harming the effective progress performance on the production side?
*  Well, it's I don't think there's a I'm not sure I agree with all those premises.
*  That's sort of that would be that would be sort of point number one.
*  I always think on this inequality debate, there are you have to always separate into three separate questions.
*  One, is it even going up?
*  It's probably going up in the US, not going up globally.
*  So the Gini coefficient of the world, not even clear that's going up.
*  But let's let's grant number one.
*  Then you have a second question.
*  Why is this happening?
*  And then a third question.
*  What to do about it?
*  And I think these things are are are are very different.
*  The why it is happening.
*  I tend to blame it more on globalization than technology.
*  I think but I think it's very over determined by by many different things that are quite hard to to solve.
*  And then I think what to do about it.
*  I often I think that many of the remedies are are actually worse than the than the disease where where if you come up with if you come up with if you come up with higher marginal tax rates, for example, you probably will just incent people to come up with more loopholes.
*  Maybe it hurts the middle class more than the wealthy.
*  And if you actually look at societies with officially very redistributionist policies, they seem to get more and more static, more redistributionist.
*  The rhetoric is.
*  And you have to go very far left before you actually get to effective redistribution.
*  Venezuela is not left wing enough to get the redistribution.
*  You have to go probably all the way to Cuba.
*  You know, Soviet Soviet Union, things like that.
*  France not nearly far enough.
*  And so so I'd rather go in a very different direction.
*  And and my my sense is always that it's that it's basically that the issue is not inequality.
*  The issue is much more stagnation.
*  There's a sense of people's living standards are are generally not improving that much.
*  And then the sort of our what can you do about that?
*  What are the what are the micro solutions for that?
*  In in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, where I live, I would say the single biggest variable that makes people feel the stagnation is is the sense in which housing costs, rental costs are are are are are through the roof.
*  And so the political fix I would I would be tempted to pursue would be trying to find a way to to break the unholy alliance between urban slumlords and pseudo environmentalists that that sort of prevent any any new urban development.
*  But but so I think it's I think it's always much more as a problem of stagnation than inequality.
*  Let's try to squeeze three more questions into the last five minutes.
*  Next. Peter and Taylor.
*  My name's Dan Chauhan.
*  I'm a patent lawyer.
*  I also consider myself a person with the ordinary cognitive intelligence.
*  And but a few years ago, I come up with a proposal that to build a human physiological simulator after the human gym project to further push the IT and the life science revolution forward and managed to talk to Dr.
*  Collins from NIH, who's the director then.
*  And his answer is a great idea, but it's too hard to do.
*  So I want to get your response for that.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah, I probably agree with that.
*  That seems seems a little bit hard to do.
*  I I generally find myself a bit skeptical of all the the AI themed discussions that we have at this point.
*  I think it's I think it's still quite a bit further away than people think.
*  It feels like a bit of a extreme consensus that AI is just around the corner.
*  It's about to happen.
*  It would take a lot longer to explain all my misgivings about it.
*  But I think it's it's a little bit too much into this conventional inequality narrative that we have rapid technological progress.
*  And the only problem is that the you know, is that people won't have jobs will be replaced by computers.
*  And I suspect that's that's not that's not quite correct.
*  I think the the the whole AI story is is if anything happening more slowly, you know, the data point people always give is self driving cars.
*  The fact they always come up with the same example suggests that maybe there's not that much to it.
*  Even if you got I think self driving cars would be significant.
*  It might replace at most one percent of the workforce might increase productivity by a few percent in the economy.
*  So if you if you phased them in over a decade, it would not be that transformative.
*  Thank you. Hi, Peter.
*  Name's Mark Naterno.
*  I'm wondering what you see as the biggest changes in the practice of science say over the last 50 years for better or worse from the perspective of innovation.
*  And whether you think that the public consciousness or concept of science has matched those changes?
*  It's gone dramatically for the worse.
*  Basically, you know, I think the basic narrative I would give is that we had this preexisting ecosystem of idiosyncratic scientists.
*  Who were who were driving research in all sorts of independent ways.
*  You could dramatically accelerate it by giving them a lot of money, which is what we did in the 1930s, 1960s.
*  But it came at this price of suddenly politicizing the system.
*  And and the problem is that a good scientist is is is very much the opposite.
*  This may be like more like 180 degrees, not one hundred seventy five degrees.
*  It's one hundred seventy nine point five degrees, the opposite of a good politician.
*  It's like a scientist is someone who's interested in the truth.
*  A politician is someone who has a very troubled relationship with the truth.
*  And I think we've had this sort of Gresham's law where the bad scientists have driven out the good or people who are nimble in the art of writing government grant applications have replaced the eccentric scientists who really, really pushed the research.
*  And I think that's that's sort of this this deep corruption of the process.
*  It's very hard for the public to be fully appreciated because it's because science is so specialized.
*  And so, you know, who am I to evaluate super string research or quantum computing research or nanotech or, you know, immunotherapy is applied to cancer.
*  And and because of this extreme specialization of science, you have these sort of self reinforcing expert communities that have that have made this process politicization extremely opaque to the to the broader to the broader public.
*  But I always I'm I'm I'm very much in favor of science, but I I'm skeptical of people who excessively invoke science as an incantation of sorts.
*  You know, you use science when you use the word science.
*  It's often a tell like in poker that you're bluffing and that no science at all is going on.
*  And so we have political science.
*  We have social science.
*  We don't have physical science or chemical science.
*  They're just physics and chemistry.
*  There's no debate.
*  Library science.
*  And so if you think about other areas where people use the word science excessively, I think those are areas that we should perhaps be a lot more skeptical of.
*  Last question. Brian Kaplan.
*  Thank you very much.
*  So here's my question.
*  How happy are the super rich?
*  I had an experience or all these super rich people, you know, or both.
*  I'm not sure this this is a terribly easy thing to measure.
*  I think this is extremely deeply subjective.
*  It's it's that people probably have fewer worries about money.
*  They have a lot of worries about how excessive money, you know, screws up relationships in different ways.
*  I think there are probably are are pluses and minuses.
*  But I would always question the premise of the question.
*  I'm not sure whether subjective happiness should be the most important metric at which we evaluate things.
*  There's many other metrics we can use.
*  Peter, thank you very much.
*  Thank you very much.
