# Malcolm Gladwell Wants to Make the World Safe for Mediocrity  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [March 15, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehlhrqSWPbo)
*  Now, most of my questions will be quite short, but my first question will be really, really
*  long since everyone knows you and your work so well.
*  I asked myself, who is Malcolm Gladwell?
*  And I tried to come up with an answer, and I'll give you my answer, and then you can
*  correct me or add to that.
*  And this will take just a little while.
*  So I think of you as a figure set really coming out of the post-war Caribbean Enlightenment.
*  So I put you in a context with, say, Sylvia Winter, CLR James, Ron Svanen, and a common
*  theme in their work is the notion that science is something potentially liberating and emancipatory.
*  So you're picking up on that with one of the channels of influence being your mother, who
*  is herself a very well-known Caribbean writer and intellectual.
*  So there's that Caribbean background, power of science, to liberate human individuals.
*  There's then on you a Mennonite influence, both from your childhood and your family,
*  where you grew up in Canada.
*  So my understanding of Mennonites is they tend to stress the notion that in the scriptures
*  there's not much talk of original sin.
*  So you see the possibility for goodness in people.
*  You then spent much of your life in Canada, so there's a kind of modesty that comes from
*  that, of temperament and also intellectual modesty.
*  You then have a father who is a mathematician, so there's the emphasis on data, and you got
*  your 10,000 hours of practice mostly at the Washington Post, an early person behind the
*  rise of database journalism.
*  So key themes in your work, I think of them as contingency, optimism, and volunteerism,
*  power of the individual.
*  Your first book, Tipping Point, is about how small moves can lead to big changes.
*  Your last book, David and Goliath, is about how David can beat Goliath in many contexts.
*  So again, contingency, optimism, volunteerism, the individual.
*  And whether it boils down to is there a better way to shoot NBA free throws or could Elvis
*  Costello have improved on his recording of Goodbye Cruel World, there's this consistently
*  optimistic perspective.
*  So you're really a very systematic thinker with core themes running out your whole work.
*  That's my take on who's Malcolm Gladwell.
*  How do you see it?
*  Who is Malcolm Gladwell?
*  Here.
*  Well, it's a very flattering interpretation.
*  I don't know if I think that deeply about myself.
*  The only thing I would add to that is I really like to tell stories.
*  And my desire to tell stories is not a product of my background.
*  It's a reaction against my background because my family, with all due respect to them, I
*  love them dearly, are not good storytellers.
*  And so that was the role I felt I filled in my family since everyone was so either uninterested.
*  The notion that you would sit around a dinner table and tell and recount hilarious stories
*  from the day was utterly absent from my childhood.
*  And when I discovered much later on that there were families where this happened, I was just
*  in awe.
*  So that was the...
*  So that's a...
*  There's two kinds of influences.
*  There's negative and positive influences.
*  You just left out the negative ones, I think.
*  I could imagine maybe your father, the mathematician, was not a natural storyteller.
*  But if I think of your mother, Joyce Gladwell, I've been reading her book.
*  It was published in 1969.
*  You even make a cameo appearance on page 178.
*  It's called Brown Face Big Master.
*  It's a memoir, and it's full of great stories.
*  And what I find profound in that is her notion of both the importance of struggle on issues
*  of race and feminism and fighting for your family, but also repeatedly being subjected
*  to what she calls, I quote, the medicine of acceptance and how you can combine those two
*  things, struggle and medicine of acceptance, in a life that also finds God.
*  And she's full of profound stories on that.
*  So did you get your storytelling nature from her?
*  Well, my mother is very quiet.
*  So she is a very lovely writer and a great storyteller when she writes, but she's not
*  one to regale the room.
*  So my mother wrote a book not as a...
*  Some people will write books, what they're really doing is they're just kind of putting
*  down on paper the stories they tell in public.
*  My mother was putting down on paper the stories she would never tell in public.
*  And it's funny that...
*  She's not unusual in this.
*  This is why I always urge people to sit down with their parents while their parents are
*  still with them and turn on the tape recorder and force them to tell stories, because surprising
*  of people don't, unless they're forced to, don't, or unless it's a deliberate act, don't
*  tell the stories from their life that are meaningful.
*  So writing that book was, I think, a very...
*  Was a very deliberate act on my mother's part to try and...
*  She was trying to make sense of...
*  I mean, one hesitates to call one's own mother's life extraordinary.
*  It was not that it was extraordinary, it was just unusual.
*  She was a black woman trying to marry a white man in England in the 50s.
*  So it was...
*  They were a little bit of an oddity.
*  Can I tell my favorite story about my father from this era?
*  So my father, they get married and they move back to Jamaica.
*  My father is teaching mathematics at University of West Indies in the early 60s, 61, and he
*  needs to get...
*  I love this story.
*  But this is a story my father did not tell me until like three years ago, which tells
*  you something about stories.
*  So it just...
*  Three years ago, he somehow just comes out and tells...
*  So at 61, he needs a particular textbook.
*  And this being 1961, you can't go online.
*  So he writes to all the libraries.
*  It turns out the closest library to Kingston, Jamaica that has this book, that he needs
*  for his research is Georgia Tech.
*  So he writes to Georgia Tech and says, can I come and use your library?
*  And they say yes.
*  And so he makes preparations and it means sailing from Kingston to Miami and taking
*  a bus from Miami to Atlanta because he doesn't have any money.
*  What he doesn't realize is that they said yes, but then the person who said yes got
*  in trouble for saying yes before they figured out his race because all they knew was that
*  a man from the University of West Indies was planning to use their library.
*  And of course, their library in 1961 would have been segregated.
*  And so it set off this huge commotion at Georgia Tech as they tried to figure out whether my
*  father was white or black.
*  And so they look, they try and find, you know, is there some...
*  They figure out where he got his PhD.
*  Could they find some kind of yearbook?
*  They couldn't.
*  They tried to get in touch with his thesis advisor, couldn't get his name.
*  Couldn't just call him because of course you can't place a call to Kingston in 1961 and
*  just sort of ask.
*  Finally they track him down through like long...
*  The day before he's about to leave, he gets a call from like the dean of whatever at Georgia
*  Tech, Mr. Gladwell.
*  He says yes.
*  Dr. Gladwell.
*  Well, we have a slightly odd question.
*  He goes, yes, what is it?
*  Are you white?
*  And my father says yes.
*  And the guy says, swear to God, oh thank God.
*  Now to my point about stories, like I said, he told that story three years ago, just happened
*  to come out like who waits until 2014 to tell a story like that from 1961?
*  There's a discussion that Sylvia Winter, the Jamaican intellectual offered in year 2000,
*  and I'd like your opinion on this.
*  She said there's something special about the United States that in Jamaica or many parts
*  of the Caribbean more broadly, that being middle class can in some way counter the fact
*  of blackness socially and serve as a kind of offset.
*  But she said about the United States, and here I quote, the US itself is based on the
*  insistent negation of black identity, the obsessive hypervaluation of being white.
*  Do you think that's an accurate perspective?
*  Well, yeah, there is something under, well I hesitate to say under theorized, but there
*  is something under theorized about the differences between West Indian and American black culture
*  and the particular, the psychological difference between what it means to come from those two
*  places.
*  And the, you don't, I think only when you look very closely at that difference do you
*  understand the heavy weight, the particular American heritage places on African Americans.
*  That there is something enormously, you know, it's funny about West Indians is they can
*  always spot another West Indian, right?
*  And you have to, at a certain point you wonder how do they always know?
*  And it's because they're, after a while you get good at spotting the absence of that weight,
*  right?
*  And it explains as well the well-known phenomenon of how disproportionately successful West
*  Indians are when they come to the United States because they seem to be better equipped to
*  deal with this, with the particular pathologies attached to race in this country.
*  You know, my mother being a very good example.
*  Of course there's a million examples.
*  You know, I was just reading for one of my podcasts, I was reading, I've been reading
*  all these oral history transcripts from the civil rights movement.
*  I was reading one today and I'm halfway through and I had that completely unbidden thing,
*  I was like, oh, this guy's a West Indian.
*  He was an African American attorney and civil rights lawyer in Virginia in the 60s.
*  I got half, like a 30 page transcript, I got to page 15, I'm like, he's West Indian.
*  And then literally page 16, my father came from Trinidad and Tobago with my mother.
*  It's like, there is something very, very real there that's sort of not, I feel like, fully appreciated.
*  Another difference that struck me, tell me what you think of this, is that the notion
*  of freedom from much of the Caribbean, it's in some way more celebratory and it's more
*  rooted in history and it may be because these are mostly majority black societies, so history
*  is in a sense controlled, so it's much more commemorative.
*  Does that make sense to you?
*  It's not a struggle to control the narration of history at a national level.
*  Oh, that's, yes, so you're in charge of the narrative.
*  Yes.
*  Which is huge, but you're also, I thought of this because I wanted to do, sorry, my
*  podcast is on my mind and I've been, I wanted to do a, and I haven't managed to figure out
*  how to do it, but there's a Jamaican poet called Louise Bennett and if you are Jamaican,
*  you know exactly who this person is and she's like the, probably the most important kind
*  of colloquial poet, maybe that's the wrong word, popular poet, and she wrote poetry in
*  dialect so she was a kind of, for a generation of Jamaicans, she was an assertion of Jamaican
*  identity and culture.
*  So when my mother, my mother was a scholarship student at a predominantly white boarding
*  school in Jamaica, she and the other black students at the school as a kind of act of
*  protest read Louise Bennett poetry at the school function when she was 12 years old.
*  So she's that kind of, and if you read Louise Bennett's poetry, a lot of it is this, it's
*  much of it is about race, but it's not, it's about race where the Jamaican, the black
*  Jamaican often has the upper hand.
*  The black Jamaican is always telling some kind of sly joke at the expense of the white
*  minority, right?
*  So it's very much, it's poetry that doesn't make sense or it doesn't make the same kind
*  of sense in a society where you're a relatively powerless minority.
*  It's the kind of thing that makes sense if you're 95%, and you're not in control of major
*  institutions and such, but you are 95% of the population and you feel like you're going
*  to win pretty soon.
*  And she has this, my mother used to read this poem to me as a child where Louise Bennett
*  is, the poem is all about sitting in a beauty parlor getting her hair straightened sitting
*  next to a white woman who's getting her hair curled.
*  The joke is that the white woman's paying a lot more to get her hair curled than Louise
*  Bennett is to get her hair straightened.
*  That's the point, right?
*  It's all this kind of subtle one-upmanship, but that's very Jamaican.
*  Now, do I ask about your podcasts?
*  I know some of them in the second season, they'll be about the civil rights movement,
*  in particular the 1950s, which are a somewhat neglected time.
*  I'll throw out just a few possible forces that led America to start to become more integrated
*  in the 50s, and you tell me which you think are neglected or underrated.
*  One would be professional sports and Jackie Robinson starting to play baseball in the
*  late 40s.
*  Another would be entertainers and move toward having more black leads in movies and also
*  music say Chuck Berry or even James Brown, Harry Truman integrating the military or the
*  desire for purposes of Cold War propaganda to actually show this country is making some
*  progress on civil rights issues.
*  Which of those or which other factors do you feel are the ones we're missing in understanding
*  this history?
*  I would put Army.
*  If I had to rank those, Army 1.
*  I would say that the entertainment and sports, I would say that it was either neutral or
*  worse than neutral.
*  Why worse than neutral?
*  Because I don't think, I actually think if we were to take the long view, and we would
*  look at this from 100 years from now, we would say that the fact that, so it is not unusual
*  for minorities to first make their mark in sports and entertainment.
*  We see that every, see it with Jews, you see it with Italians, you see it with Irish.
*  The thing that's striking to me about those movements is they move in and out of those
*  worlds pretty quickly.
*  So the Jewish moment in sports is really quite short.
*  Sure.
*  I suspect not that surprising.
*  Boxing especially.
*  It's like that long.
*  The African American moment in those transitional fields is really long.
*  It continues to this day.
*  It's almost to the point where you feel like that what happens is they move into those
*  worlds and get stalled there.
*  Their presence in that world accentuates and aggravates existing prejudice about their
*  community as opposed to serving as a kind of way station to a better place.
*  If your problem is that you're facing a series of stereotypes about how you are intellectually
*  inferior, how you have a kind of broken culture, how you have, you know, I could go on and
*  on and on with all of the stereotypes that exist, then why is being playing, how does
*  playing brutally violent sports help you?
*  How is an association, almost an over-representation in these various kinds of public entertainments
*  advance your cause?
*  So I kind of, I'm for those areas, those things when they're transitional and I'm against
*  them when they seem like dead ends.
*  How important to factor was the research of Mamie and Kenneth Clark?
*  That's some work that had there been a Malcolm Gladwell at the time would have been written
*  up even more.
*  The notion that when there's segregation people may value themselves or their race less.
*  It seems that had a big impact on the Warren Court, on other thinking.
*  What's your take on their influence?
*  Well there's a, I just, it's funny, I was just both read, the great book on this is
*  Scott's Contempt and Pity.
*  He's a very good black historian at Howard, I believe.
*  Yes, he's the chair of history at Howard.
*  And points out he has much to say.
*  So I got quite taken when I was doing this season of my podcast with the black critique
*  of Brown.
*  And the black critique of Brown starts with some of that psychological research because
*  the psychological research is profoundly problematic on many levels.
*  So what Clark was showing and what so moved the court in the Warren decision was this
*  research where you would take the black and the white doll and you show that to the black
*  kid and the black kid you would say which is the good doll and the black kid points
*  to the white doll and which doll do you associate with yourself and they don't want to answer
*  the question, right?
*  And the court said this is the damage done by segregation.
*  Scott points out that if you actually look at the research that Clark did, the black
*  children who were most likely to have these deeply problematic responses in the doll test
*  were those from the north who were in integrated schools.
*  The southern kids in segregated schools did not regard the black doll as problematic.
*  They were like that's me, fine.
*  And that result that it was kids from black kids, minority kids from integrated schools
*  who had the most adverse reactions to their own representation in a doll is consistent
*  with all of the previous literature on self-hatred which starts with Jews.
*  It was originally that literature begins with where does Jewish self-hatred come from?
*  Jewish self-hatred does not come from Eastern Europe in the ghettos.
*  It comes from when Jewish immigrants confront and come into close conflict and contact with
*  majority white culture.
*  That's when self-hatred starts, when you start measuring yourself at close quarters against
*  the other and the other seems so much more free and glamorous and what have you.
*  So in other words, the Warren Court picks the wrong research.
*  This has nothing to do with the problem caused.
*  There are all kinds of problems caused by segregation.
*  This happens to be not one of them.
*  So why does the Warren Court do that?
*  Because they're trafficking, this is Scott's argument, they are trafficking in an uncomfortable
*  and unfortunate trope about black Americans which is that black American culture is psychologically
*  damaged, that there is something, that the problem with black people is not that they're
*  denied power or that their doors are closed to them or that, no, it's because there's
*  something at their core, their family life and their psyches have in some way been crushed
*  or distorted or harmed by their history.
*  It personalizes the struggle.
*  So by personalizing the struggle, what the Warren Court is trying to do is to manufacture
*  an argument against segregation that will be acceptable to white people, particularly
*  southern white people.
*  And so what they're saying is, like, look, it's not you that's the problem.
*  Black people are, they're harmed in their hearts and we have to like, you know, usher
*  them into the mainstream.
*  They're not making the correct argument which was, you guys have been messing with these
*  people for 200 years, stop, right?
*  Like they can't make that argument because Warren desperately wants a majority, he wants
*  a nine-nothing majority on the court.
*  So instead they construct this, in retrospect, deeply offensive argument about how it's all
*  about black people carrying this, you know, and using social science in a way that's actually
*  quite deeply problematic, right?
*  It's not what the social science said.
*  This more recent line of research, some of it coming from Roland Fryer and Steve Levitt,
*  that at least claims that mixed-race children growing up have a harder time and take more
*  risks than just their socioeconomic status alone would predict.
*  Do you agree with that, take issue with it?
*  Mixed race.
*  Mixed race.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, never heard of that.
*  Doesn't apply to me, certainly.
*  No one has lived a more risk-averse life than me.
*  But I don't know.
*  I mean, you know, although I have enormous respect for both those economists, this isn't
*  one of those highly imaginative use of correlations, is it?
*  Sometimes they lose me.
*  We are economists.
*  The economists lose me when they play those games.
*  Higher education is one of your passions in life.
*  So there's a recent paper by Raj Chetty.
*  It shows that at least 38 colleges are taking in more students from the top 1% than from
*  the bottom 60%.
*  And many of those are Ivy League schools.
*  Now take, for instance, Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
*  Why are those schools not doubling the number of students they take in?
*  In your opinion.
*  Why don't they do this?
*  I was going to say, why are you asking me?
*  You're the one in the academy.
*  You must have a theory of why the world is failing this way.
*  Why, well, you know, why doesn't Louis Vuitton sell a $59 bag?
*  Because Louis Vuitton doesn't want to be in the commodity bag business.
*  They would rather sell a small number of bags at $10,000 each.
*  But Harvard could take in 2X and not lower tuition, I suspect.
*  Harvard could take in 10X and still have $40 billion left over.
*  No, I think it's, I mean, look, there's no, these guys are in the luxury handbag business.
*  They're not in the education business.
*  They are interested in sustaining a certain brand equity.
*  And they see expanding the size of their schools as diluting their brand equity in exactly
*  the same manner as Louis Vuitton does.
*  Louis Vuitton is not going to open a Louis Vuitton store across the street, right, in
*  that building over there next to the Starbucks and the, they're not going to do it.
*  Even though there may be people right here who want to go and buy a Louis Vuitton bag
*  right now.
*  They are very conscious of maintaining that aura of exclusivity.
*  That's all Harvard is doing.
*  If you thought for a moment their primary motivation was in educating as many people
*  as they could as well as they could, then I think you're living in a dream world, right?
*  This is not, they're, you know, I was walking around, this is a tangent.
*  I was in DC this weekend and I went for a walk with a friend of mine and we went to
*  Dunbart & Oaks.
*  Dunbart, you know, it's a gorgeous facility and it's owned by, it was given to Harvard
*  University in 1940 by Robert Bliss Wood in its entirety.
*  I happen to know that the, for complicated reasons that I shouldn't go into, that the
*  endowment attached to the Robert Wood, to Dunbart & Oaks is, has many, many zeros.
*  Let's just say that the endowment attached to Dunbart & Oaks is larger than the endowments
*  of all but a tiny fraction of American colleges.
*  And I also know that, we all know that on the grounds of Dunbart & Oaks, you know, they
*  have a museum where there's one of the great collections of pre-Columbian art in the world.
*  So as I was walking around the grounds of Dunbart & Oaks, I asked myself, here we have,
*  this is a facility owned by a non-profit institution which receives enormous tax benefits from
*  the American taxpayer and which has an astonishing sum of money attached to it.
*  Why can't I see the art?
*  And why does no one get upset about this, by the way?
*  I'm allowed to walk around the Rose Garden.
*  Whoopie, right?
*  There's lots of, I can't, surely I should see the art.
*  I am, as an American taxpayer, subsidizing this institution and yet it's like, and where
*  are the, why are there no, why aren't they bringing in, when was the last time they brought
*  in a busload of high school students to Dunbart & Oaks to walk them through the pre-Columbian
*  art collection?
*  Has it ever happened?
*  I don't know.
*  One economic puzzle to me is why universities such as Harvard have such high endowments.
*  Now you've just raised some objections to endowments, but if one is taking a somewhat
*  cynical economic approach to this, you would think actually they would spend more on themselves
*  from the endowment, and they don't.
*  And that raises the question of what are they really trying to maximize?
*  What's your theory of endowments and why they're so high, and why don't the people at Harvard
*  spend more on themselves?
*  Because they're not all that rich, right?
*  You had a great post on Marginal Revolution.
*  I remember you, very short in which you said that you were giving a list of things you
*  thought needed to be done in the world of economics, and one of them was you said endowments
*  are under-theorized.
*  Yes.
*  I read that and I went, aha, I'm going to steal that phrase.
*  Totally under-theorized.
*  One of the greatest philanthropists of the 20th century was Julius Rosenwald, the guy
*  who makes Sears Sears, an enormously wealthy man in the kind of 20s and 30s.
*  And he starts the Rosenwald Fund, and what does the Rosenwald Fund do?
*  It sets aside a sum of money which in today's dollars would be, I've forgotten, but probably
*  close to a billion.
*  And he decides what he wants to do is to go throughout the South and build public schools
*  throughout the South in African-American communities.
*  And one of his rules is no endowments.
*  He said we're going to spend it to zero, and they spent it to zero.
*  And to this day, there has actually been some really lovely economic work measuring the
*  economic impact of the Rosenwald schools.
*  And it's not subtle.
*  If you look at the list of things that made a tangible difference in the South in the
*  first half of the 20th century, Rosenwald schools is way up there.
*  And why did he get way up there?
*  Because he went to zero, right?
*  If he set up an endowment to fund the building of schools for African-Americans in the South,
*  we would still be building schools for African-Americans in the South.
*  It would be a hundred-year-long project, right?
*  Instead of running through a billion dollars, you would run through 5% of a billion dollars
*  every year.
*  So the very fact that you set up an endowment means that you have decided before you start
*  to minimize your impact, right?
*  I'm going to take your dollar, and I'm going to commit to spending five cents of it every
*  year, right?
*  That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
*  Who does this?
*  I don't know where it comes from.
*  Why would you not spend your money?
*  Harvard, if you have $40 billion in your Harvard, there are tons.
*  How many interesting educational things could you do with $40 billion if you gave yourself
*  a 10-year time horizon?
*  By the way, given the track record of Harvard in raising money, why for a moment do they
*  think they can't replace the $40 billion once they run through the existing $40 billion?
*  They have proven over and over again that there's one thing at which they truly are
*  world-class, and that's raising money, right?
*  The irrationality, it's irrationality upon irrationality, right?
*  They haven't even owned up to the one thing that they're truly world-class at.
*  I'm pleased that we're holding this at George Mason, a school which, in the words of our
*  president, tries to be the best school for the world and not the best in the world.
*  But let's say we put you in charge at Harvard.
*  What changes would you make?
*  You appoint the board.
*  You are the board.
*  You and your mother.
*  Oh, man.
*  This is such a great question.
*  Can I start at the beginning?
*  Start at the beginning.
*  Okay.
*  I would start by going...
*  I would establish a set of baseline criteria for admissions, and then I would have a lottery
*  after that.
*  So if you are someone who has...
*  You're in the top 2% of your high school class or whatever, we can 5% whatever cutoff we
*  want, following test scores at a certain point, whatever cutoff we want, some minimum number
*  of other things you do, you just go into the pot and we're pulling out names.
*  I would...
*  I'd probably triple or quadruple the size in the next 10 years.
*  One campuses, probably two other campuses in the United States, one overseas.
*  I would...
*  I had this idea that...
*  I'm not sure how you do it, but where I think that it would be really, really useful to
*  ban graduates of elite colleges from ever disclosing that they went to an elite college.
*  It's not a joke.
*  It's deadly serious.
*  Because what it does is it wonderfully clarifies the decision for the student of whether they
*  want to go to an elite college.
*  So you don't want the kid going to Harvard who just wants the brand name Harvard.
*  You want the kid to go to Harvard who genuinely believes that he or she can get an education
*  there that they can't get anywhere else.
*  I want that kid.
*  So if I say you can come here and get a world class, the greatest education in the world,
*  but after you graduate you can never tell anyone where you went, then I'm weeding out
*  all the Louis Vuitton shoppers.
*  And I'm getting the true scholars.
*  So if there's a kid out there who says there's a certain professor, one of my oldest friends
*  is a professor at Harvard, Terry Martin.
*  Huge fan of yours by the way, Tyler.
*  Terry, if there's a kid out there who says I want to take a, I read Terry's book, he's
*  written a couple of books, I want to do Soviet studies, I want to study with Terry, that's
*  the kid I want.
*  Right?
*  And I don't actually, I'm willing to go to any lengths to get that kid.
*  I'll give him a, I'll cut him a break, I'll kick him out of the lottery, you know, I'll
*  do all kinds of things.
*  You want that kind of, you want, if you're running a truly elite college, what you want
*  to select for is someone who is the kid, the kids who are most powerfully motivated to
*  leverage the institutional assets of the institution, I'm sorry, the intellectual assets of the
*  institution, not the brand assets of the institution.
*  And now a truly important question.
*  How would you treat the faculty?
*  Well, you know, there's a really interesting site, and I've forgotten to my eternal discredit,
*  who did it, but that looks at trends in educational spending and points out that educational spending
*  has gone like, higher ed spending has gone like that.
*  The share of higher ed dollars that goes to faculty salaries when you do all the kind
*  of, it's basically been flat for 50 years.
*  So you'd pay us more.
*  Oh yeah, I absolutely would pay you more.
*  I mean, I don't say that because I'm at a university talking to a professor, and I'm
*  the son of a professor.
*  I say that because it seems crazy to have to put academics in the kind of professional
*  firmament.
*  It seems crazy to have them losing ground to other professions when you would think
*  that the importance in a modern society of having world class faculty would be greater.
*  And to the extent, I mean, I'm not saying that if you pay academics properly more, you're
*  going to get better academics necessarily, but I do think it's not a bad idea if you
*  want to reward people going into that profession.
*  Human potential and talent, that's a key theme running throughout a lot of your work.
*  Let me ask you two or three questions on that.
*  Do you think that today we're actually working too hard to measure and spot talent very early,
*  and thus we're branding and marking people, and actually telling a lot of people they
*  shouldn't do activity X because they're measured too quickly?
*  Yeah.
*  So this is my friend David Epstein who wrote Sports Gene, is really, really interesting
*  on this subject with respect to sports, and points out that what really makes for a lot
*  of successful elite athletes is a broad early base.
*  So the last thing you want to do is to over specialize too soon with a kid for a number
*  of reasons.
*  One is the phenomenon of baseball pitchers having all kinds of arm problems in their
*  teens is a product of kids simply pitching too much too soon.
*  But you can generalize that we think that an awful lot of injuries that elite athletes
*  are suffering in their late adolescence are due to the fact that they have been doing
*  the same repetitive motions from an early age.
*  We think that burnout is also a function of this.
*  But there also is a very interesting argument beyond those to say that there is a body of
*  skills that you only learn if you have a broad early base.
*  So the basketball analogy would be Hakeem Elijahwan being a soccer player, or Steve
*  Nash being a soccer player, or in tennis Federer being a soccer player.
*  That there are extremely valuable things about basketball that are most usefully learned
*  on a soccer pitch when you're very young.
*  That kind of, now that is a beautiful analogy for academic work as well, or for any sort
*  of intellectual work that the best preparation for something over here when you're very young
*  may be something over here.
*  And then the third thing is that, the most important and the thing you're alluding to
*  is that we do a really bad job of spotting early talent simply because you can't spot,
*  you know I'm a runner and every runner knows this.
*  The kids who are the great runners in their early teens, and I was one of them, are not
*  the ones who end up being the world class athletes.
*  Sometimes they are, but there's a huge change over in the ranking of runners between 12
*  and 18.
*  At least, when I look at the ranks of world class runners and you look at their times,
*  at least half of them had mediocre times in there.
*  You know I was at the age of 13 the fastest miler from my age in Canada.
*  By 21 I was useless and washed up.
*  There was a kid who I used to destroy when I was 13.
*  He went on to be essentially world class, right on the fringes of world class.
*  I used to kill him.
*  I mean he was just not even close.
*  Anyone looking at the two of us at 13 would say, Gladwell's the talent.
*  This other guy is like, boy he should take up, he was terrible.
*  He ended up running 335 for 1500 meters, right?
*  Let's say you're giving advice to the parents and grandparents in the room.
*  You can't reshape the system, you can't even control Harvard, but you can tell them what
*  to do for their children.
*  What's your advice given all of what you just said?
*  Well you should delay specialization as long as possible.
*  You should, because of all of those, yeah, because prediction is poor and burnout, burnout
*  is as big an issue as poor prediction, early prediction.
*  I would avoid, I think the other parallel problem which I get at in David and Goliath
*  is I think that overly competitive environments at too early an age are really deeply problematic.
*  So I thought about this the other day when I was, I lived most of the time upstate New
*  York, very close to Bard.
*  And I go and I work out at the Bard gym and I was watching, so Bard has got I don't know
*  how many students, I mean is it 2000?
*  I don't even know, some tiny number.
*  And I was watching the Bard lacrosse team workout and I don't know, I don't want to
*  offend anyone who went to Bard.
*  They're not allowed to say by the way.
*  That's right, they can't say.
*  They're terrible.
*  I was just eyeballing the lacrosse team and I was like good lord.
*  I mean I felt that I could go down there at 52 and make this team.
*  And then that was my first thought and my second thought was that is so fantastic.
*  Because what it means is you can be an ordinary Joe at Bard and play lacrosse, right?
*  Now think about that in every different thing.
*  So in a school that small, with the exception of the things at which they are, I mean there's
*  probably two or three things at Bard at which they genuinely do excel.
*  I'm sure the drama program or the music program is formidable.
*  But let's accept though, any non-specialty item at Bard is going to be, it's wide open,
*  it's totally accessible.
*  You know you want to be in the physics club at Bard?
*  You can be in the physics club at Bard, right?
*  And that is a massively underrated thing.
*  So in other words there's a continuum here and exclusivity is at one end and opportunity
*  is at the other end.
*  And people constantly are confused in these two things and thinking that in exclusivity
*  and in elite status is opportunity.
*  False.
*  Eventually, that's where the opportunities lie.
*  They don't lie there when you're 16 or 17 and what is required of you is experimentation.
*  If you want your 17-year-old to explore the world, send your 17-year-old to a place where
*  the world can be explored.
*  The world cannot be explored at a super elite university, right?
*  It's impossible.
*  I had to, I talk about in David and Goliath, the phenomenon of very, very, very, very good
*  science and math students going to elite colleges and dropping out at enormously high rates
*  because they're in the 99th percentile and they're in a class full of people in the 99.9th
*  percentile.
*  And when you are in the 99th percentile and you're up against someone in the 99.99th percentile,
*  you feel stupid, right?
*  Even though you will never again in your life, unless you want to be an academic at MIT in
*  physics, be surrounded by people that smart, right?
*  It's over after that.
*  Then you go back to the real world and you're smart again.
*  So why would you artificially push yourself in a situation where you feel so dumb that
*  you stop doing the very thing that you went to school to do?
*  That's just, that is bananas.
*  That is like, and why this isn't a fact that people, like, when I was in college, what
*  I went out for the University of Toronto newspaper and they wouldn't give me a job.
*  It was too hard to get in.
*  They were brilliant people.
*  So what did I do?
*  I wrote for my pathetic joke of a, we had a residential college, we put out this kind
*  of joke thing every couple of weeks and it was insanely fun.
*  It was like, I could do whatever I wanted.
*  Nobody cared.
*  We made up all kinds of crazies.
*  I mean, in the end, I had a way better experience than I would have had if I was at the highly
*  competitive newspaper.
*  I had never forgotten that, right?
*  By virtue of being this kind of lame forgotten thing, I got to do more fun stuff and have
*  a much better time than I would have at the proper newspaper.
*  You know, this drives me, well, it clearly drives me crazy.
*  I mean, just saying, it drives me crazy.
*  Now you've argued that in the NBA, more players should shoot their free throws underhanded.
*  It would take them some time to learn, but it would turn poor shooters into somewhat
*  better shooters and that would be worth a lot in terms of performance.
*  Now you are yourself a teacher in some way, in the broad sense.
*  So what is it that we other teachers are doing wrong?
*  What is for us the underhanded free throw we're not doing enough of?
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  What are you not doing enough of?
*  I suppose I could expand on this notion of kind of that to encourage experimentation
*  and open opportunities, one must also be much more tolerant of mediocrity.
*  And that's the notion that there can be something lovely in mediocrity is, or one of your favorite
*  phrases and now mine is under theorized.
*  And I wonder whether sort of making the world safe for mediocrity is not a very worthy goal
*  of teaching.
*  Because not only because the people who will one day be good need to pass through mediocrity
*  on their way to being good, but also that it's the gateway to experimentation.
*  I don't know where one, sort of how that practically translates in a teaching session.
*  That's a very Tocquevillian answer.
*  What is it that long distance runners are not doing correctly?
*  What is their equivalent of the underhanded free throw?
*  Well, there's so many different arguments going on right now about long distance running.
*  I suppose the best way to sum them up is that like all highly competitive subspecialties,
*  everyone wants to believe they have an answer that works for everyone.
*  And in fact, the truth is that there's probably 10 different ways to train effectively for
*  long distance.
*  And we were just slow to understand how variable runners are.
*  The one interesting thing, the most interesting thing happening to meet in distance running
*  right now is the rise of Japan as a distance running power.
*  What's interesting about Japan is that Japan does not have any one runner, particularly
*  in marathons, does not have any one marathoner who is in the top 10 in the world or even
*  the top 20 in the world.
*  But they have an enormous number of people who are in the top 100.
*  Your notion of whether Japan is a distance running power depends on how you choose to
*  define distance running power.
*  So we have one definition that we use where we say we recognize a country as being very
*  good at distance running if they have lots and lots of people in the top 10.
*  But that strikes me as being incredibly arbitrary.
*  And it goes to my point about we're not encouraging mediocrity.
*  Why?
*  All that says is, OK, so Kenya's got nine of the top 10 fastest marathoners right now.
*  Why is that better than having 300 at the top thousand?
*  It's purely arbitrary that we choose to define greatest as just the country that most densely
*  occupies the 99th percentile.
*  Why can't we define it as the country that most densely occupies the 75th through 100th
*  percentiles?
*  Right?
*  There's always a segment in the middle of these chats called overrated or underrated.
*  So I'm going to list a few things you're free to pass.
*  Overrated or underrated?
*  Ketchup.
*  Your first famous article on ketchup.
*  I'm on record as saying underrated massively.
*  Massively underrated.
*  And which is the best ketchup?
*  Heinz has to be.
*  William F. Buckley.
*  Well, in his day appropriately rated, now underrated.
*  I mean, talking about someone who was a massive, William Buckley is my childhood.
*  I was obsessed with him until I had entire works of his seemingly memorized.
*  So under.
*  Who is the most underrated figure in Jamaican popular music?
*  Past, present, either?
*  Everyone knows Bob Marley, but who's the hidden gem?
*  Oh my goodness.
*  That's a really, really, really, really...
*  I'm going to pass on that one.
*  I'm going to get in trouble.
*  I would say Desmond Decker or Lee Perry if you're curious.
*  But why are they under?
*  I mean, I feel like they're places pretty...
*  Anyway, we're going to get into it.
*  In Jamaica, but I don't...
*  Millennials don't seem to know very much about who they are, is my sense.
*  Or even Toots in the Mytals or Keith Hudson or King Tubby.
*  I think they're somewhat...
*  Not in Jamaica, forgotten.
*  Because there, there's a more celebratory notion of history, right?
*  But in the United States, to me, that's sad.
*  And the notion that the leading figures in electronic music in the 70s would come from
*  Jamaica, not a high tech country, that's an extraordinary story that seems to me somewhat
*  forgotten.
*  You don't need to get me started on Jamaican triumphalism.
*  It's a David versus Goliath story.
*  The Jamaicans win.
*  My colleague, Steve Pearlstein.
*  Oh.
*  Oh, is he in...
*  He's not here, is he?
*  He used to be of the Washington Post.
*  My former editor.
*  I love Steve.
*  Underrated.
*  Absolutely.
*  I have lunch with him every week.
*  His father owned that great clothing store in Louis of Boston.
*  Louis of Boston.
*  That's right.
*  And he was always...
*  Steve, I remember as a young reporter at the Washington Post, I was very badly dressed.
*  And Steve, a highly intellectual guy who cut his teeth in a high end men's clothing store
*  in Boston, would always come up to me and adjust my suit jacket and say, what are you,
*  like a 36 short?
*  I always loved that.
*  This reminds me, by the way, kind of a little...
*  Sure, sure.
*  One of my favorite things...
*  One of the things about the Jewish immigrant experience in America that I have never gotten
*  over it, that always thrills me to bits, and I don't know why, is the transition from merchant
*  to intellectual class, that generational move, which is just so fantastic.
*  And my favorite one, there's many, many great ones, is the...
*  Speaking of Boston and retail, is that Filene's basement was started by the...
*  Filene's, right, it was started by the Filene brothers, and one of whose name was Lincoln,
*  Lincoln Filene.
*  And their kind of manager, the kind of CEO of their store, was a guy named Kirstein.
*  And Kirstein had a son who he named for his boss, Lincoln, who is Lincoln Kirstein, the
*  great giant of American ballet.
*  And so you see in Lincoln Kirstein, in the name of this extraordinary cultural figure,
*  echoes of bargain retail from Boston.
*  The idea that one person's name summons those two worlds simultaneously, it's just so...
*  It's so beautiful.
*  The similar version of this is the fact that some of the people who were...
*  Of the people who were saved by...
*  During the Holocaust by Schindler, then went on, moved to New Jersey, became real estate
*  developers, did all these subdivisions, and would always name a street after Schindler.
*  And they would bring him over for the opening.
*  But once again, you have this incredibly moving and powerful tribute that's grounded in the
*  prosaic.
*  It's the reverse of Lincoln Kirstein, right?
*  It's the...
*  But that move of moving back and forth between these worlds, I just find that...
*  I find it really beautiful and sort of moving, anyway.
*  What's the most underrated John Le Carre novel?
*  Oh, wow.
*  So many, right?
*  Well, the very early...
*  Small town in Germany, the pre-Spy came in from the cold ones I really like.
*  And I also really like...
*  I thought...
*  I've always...
*  A Little Drummer Girl is really fantastic.
*  But I think maybe the pre...
*  The super early ones are remarkably good.
*  Are Le Carre novels gladwellian in their worldview, or do you enjoy them so much because they're
*  not?
*  Are they offset or confirmation?
*  I didn't know there was such a thing as gladwellian.
*  Are they or...
*  Why do I enjoy them?
*  It is to us.
*  Why do I enjoy them?
*  I enjoy them because...
*  I enjoy them for a very specific reason that has to do with the fact that I spent...
*  I was born in England and my father is English and he's a product of...
*  My father is essentially John Le Carre's age, so they come from the same world.
*  Kind of bleak, middle class, post-war English.
*  And I have such an affection for that particular era and world.
*  And when I go back to London, I was just in London, I find myself...
*  I gravitate to those parts of London, it still looked that way.
*  Because to me, that's what London is.
*  London is not the shiny, rich London of today.
*  And London is not the gorgeous, historic...
*  What's London to me is kind of 1950.
*  And that weird moment when you're walking down a street in East London and there you
*  see a block that was clearly bombed and they built something in 19...
*  Early in 1948 that just abuts something that was built in 1820.
*  That thing, whenever I see that, it just gets me every time.
*  And John Le Carre particularly, well, Spy Who Came From the Cold is just about to me,
*  it's just about that kind of unrelenting bleakness of that world and that how all of
*  the material niceties of their world were...
*  It was just tea and biscuits, that's as good as it got.
*  That's what you look forward to every day.
*  And it was always raining and no one could say, I love you.
*  And it's just all part of it, it's just like, it's fantastic.
*  It's just...
*  And when I'm in that world, I feel so normal.
*  I just feel like I am this ray of sunshine.
*  What's your favorite non-current movie?
*  I don't go to the movies anymore.
*  I haven't been to a movie in years.
*  I don't even...
*  I can't do it.
*  I don't know why.
*  They lost me.
*  But old movies?
*  Michael Powell?
*  If you like, Alder England?
*  No, I don't even...
*  I can't remember the last movie I saw, to be honest.
*  Overrated or underrated, the idea of early childhood intervention to set societal ills
*  right?
*  Overrated because it's in...
*  To my mind, it's just another form.
*  So it became politically impermissible to say that certain people in society would never
*  make it because they were genetically inferior.
*  So I feel like that group, it's like, all right, we can't say it anymore.
*  We'll just move the goalpost up two years, and we'll say, well, if you don't get...
*  Or three years.
*  If you don't get the right kind of stimulation by the time you're three, basically it's curtains.
*  So it's like, why is that argument...
*  Which we decided we didn't like it when they set the goalpost at zero.
*  Somehow it's super important and legitimate and chin-stroking worthy when they move the
*  goalpost to three.
*  Truth is, it's not over at three any more than it was over at zero.
*  There are certain things that would be nice to get done by the age of three, but if they're
*  not, the idea that it's curtains is preposterous.
*  It's the same kind of fatalism that I thought we had defeated.
*  If you want to say that the goalpost should be at 30, then I'm open to...
*  Would you settle for 55?
*  I'm very glad to hear that answer.
*  Now, I looked back, there was an article you wrote actually in the 1990s for the Washington
*  Post.
*  It's not online, but I can confide to you all that it was leaked to me.
*  And it's called 10 Things DC Could Learn From New York City.
*  And I know it will be very hard for this crowd to believe, but you actually have ever...
*  So slight preference for New York City over Washington, DC at that time.
*  And one of the things you thought Washington needed more of, this is number three, and
*  I quote, more adventurous celebrities.
*  Do you still feel that we need more adventurous celebrities?
*  Pretty sure my opinion would change if I was doing that today.
*  Your number one, however, was shame, that this was a city that needed more shame.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  I have no memory of this.
*  Number five was the Knicks, so clearly you have no memory of this.
*  But over time, how has your view of Washington, DC changed?
*  There's a 2007 radio show you did with your mother.
*  It's actually my favorite of all your outputs.
*  I love this podcast.
*  I recommend it to everyone.
*  But there you said that you and also she did well because you were always serial outsiders.
*  Now, do you feel that in any way Washington, DC, with its culture that is in some ways
*  fairly bland, passively pushy, nervously ambitious, and just too full of politics, has this now
*  become a city where it's a good place to be a serial outsider or simply not?
*  Wow.
*  That's a really good question.
*  What was particular about...
*  I was in DC from January of 1985 until July of 1993.
*  The city obviously has gotten a lot wealthier and safer and whiter and the area a lot more
*  diverse since I was there.
*  I came here in Reagan years when an upheaval was going on politically.
*  I suppose that's happening again in some sense.
*  I don't know whether...
*  The thing that's peculiar about DC is that, particularly if you're in your 20s, is the
*  turnover.
*  There are very few places...
*  You actually make this point in complacent class about how Americans are a lot less mobile
*  than they used to be, strikingly less mobile than they...
*  This has huge consequences for society.
*  I actually think you're absolutely right.
*  It's a really, really important point.
*  DC, if you're in your 20s, is this grand exception.
*  It's massive turnover.
*  Everyone, not everyone, but when I think of the cohort I was with when I was 23 in DC,
*  none of them are in DC anymore.
*  All gone with a few exceptions.
*  I feel there is that kind of churning.
*  That churning is really, really useful in terms of giving people opportunities to look
*  at what's going on from an outsider's perspective.
*  Because you're not committing to the city, you're outside of the...
*  There's the permanent Washington, and in your 20s you're not part of permanent Washington.
*  You're skipping through from...
*  In this kind of...
*  You're kind of ringing the permanent city.
*  That was really...
*  That was what made my time here so special.
*  If I had stayed, I feel like it would, in my memory, have diminished a little bit.
*  By the way, in the 90s you also wrote a profile of Pat Buchanan, which I would encourage you
*  to reread.
*  You may be surprised by your own prescience.
*  You would have to change a few words in the article, but much of it would apply today.
*  Do you think New York City and Manhattan in particular, is that still a good place to
*  be a serial outsider?
*  What is it that you do in general to keep yourself as a serial outsider?
*  Well, I leave Manhattan.
*  Where do you go?
*  Well, there's two things.
*  One problem that I have...
*  As a writer you have a series of problems.
*  One problem, a serious problem, is that I'm old.
*  I don't mean that in a...
*  I'm decrepit.
*  What I mean is that it's very important if you are a writer to remain current.
*  The greatest danger you face is this fossilization of your positions and views.
*  One of the main reasons that I wanted to do a podcast is that a podcast forces me out
*  of my age cohort and puts me back in the land of people in their 20s and 30s primarily.
*  I'm not being Peter Pan.
*  I'm trying to rejuvenate my thinking because you become aware and you have a kind of...
*  Many professionals have a kind of professional peak in their 40s and then you can feel yourself,
*  your views hardening and you feel yourself closing off to new ideas.
*  The minute you see yourself rolling your eyes at something, that's what the kids think,
*  then you realize the end is nigh.
*  Part of what I do is try and...
*  Even when I'm writing, I don't write in an office.
*  I write in coffee shops.
*  I don't particularly think coffee shops are amazing places to write, but I do think that
*  simply just being around people who are not my age is really useful.
*  I travel a lot.
*  That's a really, really useful way of breaking out of bad intellectual habits and to remind
*  yourself about what the rest of the world is like.
*  I also try to be intellectually flexible.
*  Let me tell you about a worry I have.
*  Maybe you can talk me out of my worry.
*  I worry that insofar as one is intellectually flexible on any particular thing, it becomes
*  a way actually of protecting some broader and more hidden edifice.
*  That there's a kind of oddly hidden desperation or even pessimism embedded in certain kind
*  of flexibilities.
*  There's something to be said for erecting a quite rigid structure, which people tend
*  to do more when they're young.
*  Then it can be toppled.
*  One becomes, quote unquote, wiser, more flexible, more willing to revise.
*  You've written about how different columns...
*  They're opening questions.
*  They get people to think.
*  I worry in my own writing when I try to do this that in some ways it's a deeper dogmatism
*  than erecting the highly dogmatic structure, which can be toppled.
*  Do you have that same worry or how do you see those trade-offs?
*  Do you see what I'm saying?
*  We're at the point in the conversation where you reveal yourself to be much smarter than
*  I am.
*  I've never thought it through that deeply.
*  I don't think of myself as having an edifice.
*  I have a series of positions and feelings about things.
*  You said early on that you thought of my work as being optimistic.
*  I feel that's a feeling and not an edifice.
*  I don't have a formal reason to be optimistic.
*  I'm just an optimistic person.
*  I have a physiological optimism as opposed to an intellectual optimism.
*  Also, I don't understand what the point would be if you weren't optimistic.
*  Why would you get up if you...
*  I know people who enjoy their own pessimism in a strange way.
*  I don't think you could be an athlete...
*  To come back to running, you can't really be an athlete and be a pessimist.
*  The whole point of being an athlete is you're building towards something.
*  You don't just work out to work out.
*  You work out because there's something out there that you're trying to...
*  Anyway, that's the side point.
*  But I think of...
*  Here's a good example.
*  On the Affordable Care Act, I have changed my mind six, seven times.
*  I'm not toggling back and forth between pro and con.
*  I feel like I'm jumping around.
*  I'm eminently persuadable on it.
*  What that has done is it's been very, very useful now because now it's very fashionable
*  for liberals to be super into the Affordable Care Act because it's under fire.
*  I feel myself being sucked in that direction.
*  But then I remember, wait a minute.
*  I've been bouncing around for five years on this.
*  Why am I suddenly, just because it's politically expedient, running to the fence of this thing,
*  which literally a year ago, if you quoted me at a party, I would be the guy saying,
*  and here's another problem with that.
*  And this is still the best book I read about healthcare was an out and out attack on Obamacare.
*  So I kind of...
*  That to me is...
*  That's really useful to kind of turn over your...
*  And accept the fact that 50% of the time you're going to be wrong on these kind of things,
*  but that's fine.
*  Now it's been said that satire sometimes reaffirms power while poetry affirms only
*  its own power.
*  You have a podcast where you express a worry that Tina Fey, by mimicking and satirizing
*  Sarah Palin, actually made her more acceptable and more likable in doing so.
*  So fast forward to the current moment.
*  We have Saturday Night Live, Alec Baldwin and Donald Trump.
*  Is that useful satire?
*  Is it not sufficiently negative?
*  Should we be deploying poetry or is that the effective medium for social commentary?
*  Well, I don't like the Alec Baldwin, Donald Trump.
*  I don't think actually it's...
*  If you compare it to the Sean Spicer, it's not as good.
*  And it's not as good because the truly effective satirical impersonation is one that finds
*  something essential about the character and magnifies it.
*  Something buried that you wouldn't ordinarily have seen or have glimpsed in that person.
*  So with the Spicer impersonation, why that's so brilliant is it draws out his anger.
*  He's angry at being put in this impossible position.
*  That is the essence of that character.
*  So how does a person respond to this?
*  It's almost an absurd position he's in.
*  And he has this kind of...
*  It's not sublimated.
*  It's there, this kind of rage.
*  In every one of his utterances, it's like, I can't fucking believe that I am in this...
*  And so that satirical impersonation gets beautifully at that thing.
*  It satirizes that.
*  And so when...
*  I've forgotten the name of the woman who does it.
*  Melissa McCarthy.
*  Yes.
*  When Melissa McCarthy, when she picks up the podium and back...
*  That's an absurd illustration of that fundamental point.
*  But the Alec Baldwin Trump doesn't get at something essential about Trump.
*  It simply takes his mannerisms and exaggerates them slightly.
*  But he hasn't mined Trump.
*  And there are many directions you can go with Trump.
*  I mean, the kind of extraordinary insecurity of the man, which I...
*  You know, like I said, there are many things you could pluck out.
*  But that, for one, the idea of doing an impersonation where you really thought deeply about what
*  it would mean in a comic way to represent this man's almost kind of tragic level of
*  insecurity.
*  That's an interesting...
*  And Alec Baldwin is not...
*  He's a little too glib to be able to...
*  And that's the problem with Saturday Night Live, the larger problem.
*  I was trying to get out of that podcast episode on satire.
*  The problem with doing satire through the vehicle of a show like Saturday Night Live
*  is they're not incentivized to do that kind of deep thinking.
*  The Melissa McCarthy thing is an exception.
*  It's not the rule.
*  Really what they're incentivized to do is for the actor who is, in many cases, as famous
*  or more famous than the person they are impersonating.
*  The actor is using the character to further their own ends.
*  Tina Fey is infinitely more popular, more accomplished, more whatever than Sarah Palin
*  will ever be.
*  And so she's using Sarah Palin to further her own ends.
*  That's backwards, right?
*  She's not inhabiting the character of Sarah Palin in order to make a point about Sarah
*  Palin.
*  She is inhabiting Sarah Palin in order to make a point about Tina Fey.
*  And I feel like so long as satire is done by a television show which has such a lofty
*  position in the cultural hierarchy, it's always gonna be the case that that's what's gonna
*  drive their impersonations.
*  They're always gonna be sitting on their hands.
*  Remember, they're making fun of Trump six months after they had him on the show, after
*  they were complicit in his rise.
*  And after Jimmy Fallon ruffled his hair on camera.
*  So I mean, these are people who, I mean, maybe that's fine.
*  My point is, you can't be an effective satirist if you are so deeply complicit in the object
*  of your satire.
*  My last question before we have a few audience questions.
*  I was very struck by what I think is your latest New Yorker column where you wrote about
*  what is parallel and not parallel between the cases of Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg
*  and the Pentagon Papers case.
*  And in my reading of the Pentagon Papers case, here's what really struck and astonished me.
*  And I'd like your view on how it's changed.
*  When the Pentagon Papers became public in, I think, 1971, first they were incredibly
*  boring.
*  But when you did read them or write excerpts, one of the things that startled so many people
*  is it came out that there were accords dating back to 1954 where it turned out America had
*  broken the accords and not North Vietnam.
*  And this shocked people and caused them to reassess their whole sense of the Vietnam
*  War.
*  And that's 1954, which was then from 1971, a long time ago.
*  So there was a sense of history embedded in how people understood that episode that seems
*  to me entirely lacking today to get someone to care that much about something done under
*  other administrations.
*  You know, 17 years earlier seems virtually impossible.
*  What is it about America that's changed so that history now doesn't matter the way it
*  did then?
*  Yeah, so this is, you've touched on the thing about the Pentagon Papers controversy, which
*  is in retrospect so unbelievable.
*  It makes, viewed through a present-day lens, the whole thing is bananas.
*  It makes no sense whatsoever.
*  It's the most hilariously wonky, nerdy exercise.
*  So even step back, what is the Pentagon Papers?
*  It is Robert McNamara saying in whatever, 69 or 68, whatever, what we really need is
*  to get the smartest historians in the room to write me a 10-volume set on historical
*  analysis going back 20 years on this conflict we're involved in.
*  So right from the start, we're in a kind of rarefied academic realm and he gathers a bunch
*  of PhDs who slave away on this thing and produce this massive turgid, you know, and you have
*  Ellsberg who is the central player in this whole thing.
*  And what is Ellsberg?
*  He is the wonkiest of the wonks.
*  So he is, he wrote a bit of it and his great complaint as he takes, he gets a copy of the
*  Pentagon Papers, he's trying to get everyone to read it and by reading it he means, I need
*  you to go away for however many months it will take you and work your way through all
*  10 volumes.
*  And there's these hilarious conversations he has with Kissinger where he's trying to
*  get, Kissinger just wants a summary.
*  He's like, no, you can't do a summary.
*  You got to read the whole thing.
*  You got to get a couple thousand words in before, a thousand pages in before it makes
*  any sense.
*  And it's just like, there's no contemporary, I mean, it's like history something.
*  It's not just 2017 and 1971 viewed through the lens of the Pentagon Papers controversy.
*  They belong on different planets.
*  I mean, we're not even, the whole, and when the New York Times gets the copies, I mean,
*  remember, and it takes them like a year or whatever to photocopy all of it because it's
*  enormous and the copies are really slow.
*  And the great, you know the great story, which is the woman who is now Linda Resnick, who's
*  now a billionaire and lives in a great, you know, when you're driving down Wilshire in
*  Beverly Hills, there's like those massive houses to your left as you drive into Beverly
*  Hills.
*  She lives in one of those houses.
*  She's the one who has the pomegranate juice, palm juice, anyway.
*  She was the boyfriend, the girlfriend of Ellsberg's best friend and she ran an ad agency on the
*  Beverly Boulevard and she had a Xerox machine, which is a huge deal in 1971.
*  So he does it.
*  He goes, she has the, she's the one who provides this, which I just think is, I once ran into
*  her at some event in LA.
*  I was like, you had the Xerox machine?
*  What a great role to play in history.
*  But every part of it is all about people who took history so seriously that they were willing
*  to spend all night photocopying for months on end.
*  And then Ellsberg took copies and he went around the Capitol also trying to get senators
*  to read it.
*  And you know, it was just as long and his big, and over and over again, the complaint
*  that drove him to leak it to the New York Times was that no one's taking this seriously.
*  And what does the New York Times do when they get a cop, when they get the copies?
*  They rent a room, two rooms in the Hilton, like right next to the New York Times headquarters,
*  and then spend months reading it again, months, reading it months.
*  Like it's, it's just this kind of thing that it's just, I mean, imagine today if this thing
*  dropped, I didn't even know how we would, people would have to do takes that would come
*  out within six hours.
*  I mean, there isn't, they'd have to do an executive summary of the executive summary
*  in order to be able to like, yeah, the whole way it doesn't, it belongs to a different
*  era.
*  I almost feel like it's the last, it feels like the, it is the final act in an intellectual
*  era in American life when institutionalized government was expected to comport itself
*  according to standards and norms that came from the academy, right?
*  The whole thing is about people who came out of elite schools and had a certain expectation
*  about what it meant to be a public servant and what your intellectual responsibilities
*  were as a public servant.
*  And they carried those norms with them from graduate school to Washington, right?
*  And that's the whole, and the fact that Ellsberg is a PhD in decision sciences and wrote papers
*  with Thomas Schelling is not a peripheral fact, it's the core fact, right?
*  That's who they were, right?
*  So when you, we go, we fast forward and you have Edward Snowden, who is a community college
*  dropout, which I don't say is a snobbish thing.
*  I'm contrasting him to his predecessor who was a PhD from MIT, right?
*  And Snowden's intellectual understanding of what he was engaged in is just, it is a fraction
*  of, you know, he used a search engine just to pluck stuff at random from the NSA files
*  and hand it over to people.
*  That's not what Ellsberg was doing.
*  And you, in the gap between those two figures is the story of, you know, the last 50 years
*  of the changes of the last 50 years in American life.
*  Before we move to a very brief Q&A, let's have a big round of applause for Malcolm Gladwell.
*  We have two microphones.
*  Just to be clear, the purpose is for Malcolm to answer, not really for you to ask.
*  So if you make a speech, I will cut you off.
*  Please ask a brief to the point question.
*  And we will start at this microphone.
*  Yes.
*  Hi.
*  I just wanted to know when we're going to get more podcasts.
*  I'm doing them, I'm writing them as we speak.
*  I'm actually doing some interviews tomorrow in the DC area for one of the shows there
*  and they'll come back out in June.
*  Awesome.
*  Thank you.
*  Next question over here.
*  Hi.
*  Good evening.
*  Thanks again.
*  What tools should we use to discover talent within ourselves and others?
*  Is that a question?
*  It's a great question.
*  Impossible to answer in time that I have.
*  But well, you know, if I can use my favorite subject of running as an example, the amount
*  If you look at times in the marathon today and compare them to times from 30 years ago,
*  we are radically slower today.
*  I'm not talking about the elite level, I'm talking about the sub-elite level.
*  The number of Americans, for example, who can break three hours in a marathon today
*  is a fraction of what it was in 1980 or 1985.
*  And that goes to this point that our tools are, in order to extract running talent from
*  the general population, you need to have a really, really broad base.
*  And the broad base is gone.
*  There is still elite running that produces really good, fast runners.
*  But in 1980, there was this many people running the kind of mileage necessary to run a marathon
*  properly and today there's this many.
*  And all of our attention and focus is on the 95th percentile.
*  But what we don't understand is we'll never find the next great marathoner until we re-broaden
*  the base.
*  When we had a base this big of mediocre marathoners, we had the two greatest marathoners in the
*  world.
*  Now that our base is this big, we got nobody in the top ten.
*  This side, next question.
*  Thank you.
*  Hi, my name is Jesse Rifkin, big fan.
*  My question is, when you were interviewed by Ezra Klein recently, you said that you
*  and some friends used to run a publication titled Ad Hominem, a journal of slander and
*  political opinion.
*  In a world where academics and quality journalists and intellectuals so often fail to connect
*  with the public, and at least if November's any indication, ad hominem attacks do, should
*  we bring that or something like that back?
*  No.
*  No, this was a zine that had an unnecessarily provocative title.
*  We felt that there was a quality, we were all obsessed with William F. Buckley, and
*  we thought that there was a quality of high-end invective that he personified that we were
*  trying to emulate.
*  I don't think that is a necessary exercise in 2017.
*  I think it was more useful in a more genteel era, but I think it's a bad idea.
*  Well, screw you.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  Next question.
*  Hi, so I've heard you talk about kind of systematic inequalities in how we identify students
*  in education.
*  Do you think the same exists in small business, and if so, what could a small business do
*  to identify kind of an undermined pool of talent that isn't being reached?
*  Yeah.
*  That's another interesting question.
*  I don't know if I have a kind of useful answer to that.
*  I mean, I was struck recently by looking at a set of numbers, and I may have been on
*  Marginal Revolution, about how the rate of startups in this country has been falling,
*  since the 80s.
*  Since the 80s.
*  Which, like most people, I was surprised by that.
*  I thought I sort of bought the Kool-Aid, the thought we were in this kind of great age
*  of new business formation.
*  And the thing about that that's so worrying is I would have thought that, I would imagine
*  that an awful lot of what it takes to encourage someone, that takes for someone to start a
*  new business is some kind of direct knowledge of someone else who started a new business,
*  in the same way that it's very hard to get people to want to go to college if they don't
*  have someone in their life who has gone to college, right?
*  Or to understand the importance of it, unless they have some kind of personal connection.
*  So when you have these, so when you see a trend line that's going down in something
*  like that, I wonder whether it will accelerate over time, that the less business get started,
*  the less businesses get started, right?
*  Because there's no one with any kind of connection of.
*  You have to have some glimpse of this as a potential possibility.
*  And that would result, I think, in a lot of business talent being squandered.
*  I mean, I will say parenthetically to this, that the number, you know, I'm someone who's
*  self-employed.
*  When I worked for, before I was self-employed, I worked for large organizations.
*  And if you would ask me when I worked for the Washington Post, say, would I ever want
*  to be self-employed, I would have said, reacted with horror.
*  I would have thought, I can't understand how you could do that.
*  Don't you wake up every morning in a cold sweat knowing where your next dollar is coming
*  from?
*  Turns out, I'm way happier self-employed than I was working for.
*  But getting there took, and it took 20 years, it took all kinds of lucky breaks, it took
*  all kinds of, there was no one in my life who, I didn't know any self-employed people,
*  I didn't know how to make that kind of jump.
*  And I wonder how many people are in a similar position of not realizing they have the ability
*  to be, do something entrepreneurial, and would be happier doing something entrepreneurial,
*  but just have no example.
*  Two more questions.
*  Next, over here.
*  Hi, thanks for being here.
*  Something that surprised me about what you just said earlier in the conversation was
*  that you feel you're a very risk-averse person.
*  Can you expand on that?
*  Well, I'm a product of one of the greatest welfare states in the history of welfare states,
*  Canada in the 70s.
*  I have come from my home with two happily married people who were, you know, the sweetest,
*  kindest, and almost non-threatening parents of all time.
*  I went to genial Canadian public schools where I was treated with respect at every turn.
*  And then I got out of college and was almost immediately given a job by a very, very well-heeled
*  Fortune 500 company where I was cosseted and given every opportunity without ever asking
*  for it.
*  So like, where's the risk taking?
*  My bio is just one long, you know, effortless, riskless, frictionless.
*  You know, I've gone from one – there was a wonderful phrase that Chuck Lane, Charles
*  Lane, who once used to describe the Washington Post, he described it as the fur-lined rat
*  hole.
*  And I have gone from one fur-lined rat hole to the next over the course of my life.
*  So yeah, I've never had to really take any risks.
*  Final question.
*  Hi.
*  As a Canadian and, you know, Jamaican background, can you explain your take on the anti-intellectual
*  movement in the United States?
*  Is it just that we have big guns, big religion, and, you know, we're not afraid to throw
*  that around?
*  Or what do you think?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, is it any different – I mean, different – first of all, I don't know whether – well,
*  let me back up.
*  The role that evangelical Christianity plays in this country's culture is very different
*  from other Western countries, so that's clearly a consideration.
*  That's been a force not for anti-intellectualism.
*  That's wrong.
*  It's been a force for a particular approach to intellectual life.
*  You know, Christianity – and I say this as someone who comes from an evangelical Christian
*  background – is a deeply intellectual culture on many levels.
*  But there are certain questions on which the religious perspective orients thinking a little
*  differently from the secular intellectual mainstream.
*  So that's been a prominent part of this country, I think, for a long time.
*  But also I think that there's a – I would say – I would phrase a lot of what's going
*  on now not in terms of intellectualism versus anti-intellectualism, but a kind of – I've
*  said this before – that the most striking thing about American public life to me as
*  a non-American is the extent to which it's dominated by backlash.
*  I think of the history of American life over the last 150 years as just one period of prolonged
*  backlash after another.
*  There are these – you know, you have a backlash to the Civil War that basically lasts 75 years.
*  Then you have the Brown decision.
*  Then you have backlash to the Brown decision that lasts 25 years.
*  Then you have a little moment for feminism in the 70s and you have a backlash that lasts
*  until – I mean, it might still be going on.
*  You have a little – I mean, there's a gay rights backlash which dwarfs the little
*  moment of – gay rights pops its head into the public discourse and the backlash goes
*  on for years and chases every Democrat out of Congress and distorts two election cycles.
*  So it's like – and I feel like we're in the middle of another one of these – I
*  don't know why American backlash cycles – it's a kind of one step forward, four steps back
*  that I don't – maybe I'm naive.
*  I don't see that in other cultures.
*  I've just been – I've only been thinking this because I've been doing these podcast
*  episodes on the 50s and 60s and on civil rights movements and those.
*  And the backlash – you know, the backlash to Brown is so phenomenal.
*  I mean, it's so great that you have to seriously ask yourself whether Brown was worth it.
*  I mean, there's a great paper written on the Brown backlash thesis by a historian whose
*  name sadly has escaped me right now, Clar – is it Clar – Michael Clar, maybe?
*  Clarman, Michael Clarman, thank you – which you should read because – although he doesn't
*  take this tack, but as I read that paper he just points out, you know, the backlash is
*  sort of 10X what Brown is – distorts the politics of the South for two generations,
*  etc., etc.
*  You read that and you have to think, Jesus, maybe it wasn't worth it.
*  I mean, maybe we should have just done something a lot more subtle and not risk this.
*  And I feel like what's going on now in American life is a backlash that maybe one reading
*  is that there was a – the dominant kind of liberal intellectual culture in this culture
*  – in this country went too fast.
*  Maybe we went too fast and we just have to learn to slow down.
*  You can't do everything you want in one generation.
*  And my current take on – I'm currently pro-Obamacare, this will change – but my
*  current take is – it was a good idea, but you know what, maybe it was a bridge too far.
*  Maybe it just was the thing that – maybe we should have done a little tiny smaller
*  piece of it and just mellow it out because in part that's what we're seeing now.
*  The centrality of Obamacare in the current backlash narrative is so weird, right?
*  Make any sense.
*  Many of the people who are against it are beneficiaries of it.
*  This law is not this kind of pox on American life.
*  It's managed to bring down – I mean, there's tons of – from a perfectly rational standpoint,
*  if you were an ardent right-winger, this is not the thing you would go after, right?
*  There's a ton of other battles.
*  The fact that they want to fight this battle first is really strange and can only be interpreted
*  in terms of – it's the backlash.
*  It's like – it's the symbol of what you – of the thing that just drove you crazy
*  and appalled you over the last couple of years and you just want to banish it from your site.
*  And that's – so that's – I think that – does that answer your question?
*  Two announcements.
*  There is book signing outside and second, you can subscribe to this podcast.
*  Just Google Conversations with Tyler.
*  iTunes many other ways.
*  Again, a big hand for Malcolm Gladwell.
