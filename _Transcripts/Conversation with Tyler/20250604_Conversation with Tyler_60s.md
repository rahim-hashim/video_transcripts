**Conversation with Tyler:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k)
*  What's something you've learned about markets or society that you didn't believe 10 years ago? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k&t=0.0s)]
*  That is very hard to get people off of their baseline for the long term. There's a lot of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k&t=4.8s)]
*  interventions that can happen that will change somebody's short-term prospects and whether [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k&t=10.24s)]
*  that's a job training program or an addiction treatment program, an education program, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k&t=14.56s)]

*  We're very focused on the evaluations that we fund of try to do long-term effects of programs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k&t=40.24s)]
*  and policies because you know oftentimes if you're just looking at what the six-month effect is [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  you find an effect and a cost-benefit ratio that's not relevant to what actual policy making should be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMBH6yLF6k&t=52.48s)]
