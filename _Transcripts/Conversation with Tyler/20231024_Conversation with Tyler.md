*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  I'm talking today with Jacob Miechanowski.
*  He is the author of one of my favorite books this year.
*  It is called Goodbye Eastern Europe, An Intimate History of a Divided Land.
*  He is also a well-known journalist.
*  He's published in the New York Times, Atlantic, Harper's, and many other places.
*  A historian who studied at UC Berkeley and in general an all-around smart, curious person.
*  Jacob, welcome.
*  Thanks so much for having me on.
*  It's a real pleasure.
*  If you had to generalize about the difference in senses of humor between Eastern Europe
*  and Western Europe, how would you put it?
*  The Eastern Europeans have a real sense of humor.
*  I don't know what Western European humor is, but a sense of the tragic sense of the absurd
*  sense of how those two go together.
*  I think that's a great question.
*  Finding laughter in the worst situations.
*  Finding a way to laugh at really dark things.
*  I think that's a feature of German Jewish humor, Ashkenazi humor, and I think it's found
*  everywhere across the region.
*  I know there's a Romanian saying to kind of laugh at your tears.
*  And I think that kind of sums it up.
*  Laugh at your sorrows.
*  What do you think of the stereotype that A, Eastern Europeans don't smile very much,
*  and B, they sometimes think Americans are stupid for smiling so much.
*  True?
*  Untrue?
*  I grew up believing it completely.
*  And you grew up in Poland, right?
*  Well, no, I grew up in America in a Polish family, and that would go back and forth a
*  few times.
*  And I grew up in a family that kind of got, the parents who kind of got stuck here inadvertently
*  in 1981 when martial law was declared.
*  They were here, they were in America for either six weeks or six months.
*  They had different visas and they kind of got trapped.
*  And they lived in a kind of a Polish cultural bubble.
*  They didn't know English when they came here, or very little.
*  And I grew up kind of in that culture.
*  And yeah, that's absolutely, I don't smile that much.
*  My mom doesn't.
*  We often get asked if we're very serious.
*  Are we sad?
*  Are we depressed?
*  And I do find, or I did find, for American habits that are a little odd, like nervous
*  laughter.
*  That's not really a Unistrln European thing.
*  To punctuate sentences with a laughter, you know, just sort of introduce yourself.
*  You know, I'm Bob from Ohio.
*  Ha ha ha.
*  Very strange.
*  So there is a little bit of a microcultural disconnect.
*  I grew up believing that completely and being told that by my parents too.
*  I was in Poland last year and I had the sense, this surprised me, that Poles right now are
*  smiling a fair amount.
*  Maybe more say than Germans would be doing.
*  Now is that just 4% rate of growth for several decades?
*  Or do you think my impression is incorrect and people still are going around looking
*  somewhat grumpy?
*  I think you're right.
*  I think it's growth plus the hegemonic West expanding, which is not necessarily a bad
*  thing, but a certain set of cultural mores has crumbled, especially in kind of the big,
*  like in Warsaw.
*  I remember how shocked I was when I had like really good customer service in a cafe in
*  like maybe 2006, 2007 with the kind of the extra American, would you like anything more
*  with that?
*  And I'm like, what are you saying?
*  What are you talking to me?
*  And the mores had started to shift.
*  That kind of old confrontational dour way of interacting had inflected and now it's
*  really changed.
*  Now there's a new generation that seems much more Western, it seems much more American.
*  And it is like it's visible in customer interactions, stores, fashion, and yeah, and how people
*  even facial expressions, eye contact, a little like more direct than it used to be, I think.
*  If I think of the Russian women I know, they would say be in their 50s largely.
*  It's surprising to me or was originally how many of them had their kids quite young.
*  Maybe they were 20, 21, might've even divorced shortly afterwards and then had kind of a
*  second real marriage.
*  That pattern seems to have shifted.
*  There's much more marrying in the late 20s, which is more of a US higher education, Western
*  European rhythm to childbearing, having children then in the early 30s.
*  What caused that change?
*  And why did they have kids so young to begin with?
*  That's interesting.
*  That's actually very true of my aunt who stayed in Poland.
*  My mom came to America just to visit her aunt and my aunt stayed in Poland and had her
*  first daughter at 21, had that kind of first short marriage and then a later marriage,
*  another daughter.
*  And that has kind of changed.
*  I think it's a shift to those more Western, more career oriented, home and car oriented,
*  savings oriented lifestyles.
*  I mean, it's a really different political economy in the 70s and 80s.
*  You were not waiting to save up for an apartment.
*  You were usually on a list that your parents put you on and you were waiting to be rented,
*  filled right to an apartment.
*  You didn't have a hope of a car.
*  And jobs were kind of not exactly crap shoot, but you were going to be assigned something.
*  So you could actually start.
*  If you went through college, even if you didn't, you might be in a position to have
*  a place to live and income to support family at 21, 22, and nothing much to save up for.
*  No real way to save up, no real goal to save towards.
*  And that's completely shifted.
*  People are trying to wait.
*  And in a pretty unstable, in Poland, a volatile economy, at least in the past 20 years,
*  growing, but with some tremors.
*  And people have that more Western of like save up for now.
*  You can buy a house.
*  You can apartments have become expensive.
*  So it's a much more Western life track that people are on.
*  You studied Poland.
*  You've lived there.
*  You're fluent in Polish.
*  If you compare your understanding to say your highly educated American readers,
*  what's the key thing you feel you understand about Polish culture that maybe they don't?
*  And let's say they've been to Poland once and they've read two or three books on it,
*  but they're not experts.
*  That's the first question.
*  And I feel I come at Polish culture a little bit
*  askance from the way most Poles come at Polish culture.
*  So I might say I feel like I have a different approach to Polish culture than
*  Americans who come to Poland cold.
*  And from a lot of Poles who see Poland and have grown up in Poland,
*  that's largely monocultural, mono-ethnic, mono-religious.
*  99% Polish, Polish speaking, 99% Catholic around there.
*  There's a little bit of erosion.
*  And now there's a lot bigger Ukrainian minority than there used to be, but up to recently.
*  And that people project that back in the past.
*  That's what Poland's been always.
*  And I come from a Polish Jewish family with Lithuanian roots,
*  split Polish and Jewish, not just Jewish.
*  Historically, Poland's been much more mutable.
*  It's expanded and contracted.
*  It's included many people who we wouldn't call Poles now, but who are under Polish rule.
*  It was multi-religious.
*  Jews were part of this state and entity for centuries.
*  And included other minority like Belarusians
*  are deeply tied up with this other part of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.
*  In Poland, there is a name for their kind of two schools of thought on what Poland is and should be.
*  They come from the two dynasties that ruled Poland, the first two dynasties.
*  There's Piast, Poland, and Jagiellonian, Poland.
*  And Piast is that more narrow one culture, one religion.
*  That's what's been assigned to it.
*  And that's the kind of the dominant view.
*  And the Jagiellonians are this bigger, we're a confederation of peoples.
*  We're a bigger country.
*  We have kind of a big tent version of Polishness.
*  And I kind of come from that.
*  So I think there's more to it than most Americans know.
*  And also in a way than some Poles know.
*  This polycultural background, how much do you feel it has strong deep roots?
*  So is it your view that, well, now it's mostly gone.
*  It really will not come back.
*  Or the fact that what we now call Poland was so strongly polycultural,
*  say, you know, 100 years ago, 150 years ago,
*  that this will in some sense reemerge and it will reemerge
*  because it had been part of the past for so long.
*  Really interesting.
*  It really was deeply rooted deep in the Middle Ages.
*  Definitely in early modernity.
*  And that old, mostly, supposedly mostly Polish Poland
*  actually was hard to recover.
*  Actually was kind of west of, it's the western part of Poland.
*  It had tons of Germans, which people forget.
*  It was also in a different way, different balance, multi-ethnic.
*  But the 20th century did so much to change Poland's geography,
*  Poland's borders, Poland's ethnic and religious makeup.
*  That if you had asked me that 15 years ago, 10 years ago, I'd say no.
*  It's Poland is what it is.
*  Poland is, you know, the White Eagle, the Pope, the Catholic Church.
*  It's a pretty set thing.
*  It's amazing how much I think the war in Ukraine has changed things.
*  That we're going towards and the influx of Ukrainians,
*  and actually Belorussians too, and people from,
*  actually there are also Chechens in a smaller number,
*  people from the former Soviet Union.
*  And because of that war, the, I think, perceptions of difference
*  have really shifted in Poland.
*  It's become, from a very close society, I think it's opened up a little bit
*  in a very meaningful way.
*  And it's recovering some of that polyethnicity that had lost.
*  We'll see how lasting that is.
*  But I think it's something that's really shifted in the last few years.
*  Is there a future of any kind for Germanic culture and influence in Poland?
*  So as you know, Roszlaw was once Breslau.
*  A lot of the achievement in that city came from people with Germanic origins,
*  growing up speaking German.
*  Is that somehow inevitable given where Germany and Poland are?
*  Again, that's been wiped out.
*  It's just simply never coming back.
*  Germany's depopulating.
*  Bye bye Germanic influence in Poland in any direct sense.
*  What do you think?
*  I think the Germanic influence comes from Poles living and working in Germany,
*  and especially Silesia.
*  Silesia, that part of Poland that's on that side, has people there,
*  a larger percentage of them have German or mixed German roots.
*  There's an area in the south that had a larger number of Germans stay.
*  Most Germans left or were forced to leave.
*  There's some influence.
*  But the bigger thing is that border area, people really go to Germany
*  and Switzerland and Austria to work.
*  People from eastern Poland, the pattern has been to go to UK and France and Belgium
*  or America.
*  The influence, I think, comes from return migration and cross-border travel.
*  Germans are going that much back to Poland.
*  They do people with roots, and there are a lot of Germans with roots
*  in both northern Poland and western Poland.
*  They go, they see the old church, the old cemetery, the old house.
*  A lot of that stuff is actually intact.
*  There's nostalgia towards, but they're not moving back very much.
*  So I think it's from what context are, what influence are from labor migration.
*  Why is the best Polish folk art from southern Poland?
*  It is.
*  It is from southern Poland.
*  I'll venture a guess.
*  That's hard for me to say for sure.
*  But some of it is the mountains are a little different.
*  The south of Poland is the only place that has real terrain.
*  All the rest of it's flat.
*  The south has our Carpathian Mountains.
*  It has a little difference.
*  The culture there is a little different.
*  It was different.
*  There are Górals, which are kind of mountain people in the direct south of Zakopane.
*  And in the past, groups called the Bojks and Lemks or Lemkos, orthodox groups,
*  it was a more multicultural area.
*  And it was Habsburg.
*  And it was under the Habsburgs.
*  It was kind of the most underdeveloped, the most rural, Ruritanian part of Poland.
*  It was, because Poland's kind of a nice natural experiment.
*  It was split into three parts in 1795.
*  One part went to Prussia and became kind of economically prosperous,
*  but culturally uninteresting as the kind of agricultural hinterland
*  of an industrializing state.
*  The Russian part became the industrializing core,
*  like center of a more economically backward state, became the Warsaw and Łódź,
*  became the big factory hubs, centers.
*  And then Galicia, the south, joined an empire that was,
*  the Habsburg Empire was kind of in between economically,
*  but was left extremely underdeveloped, extremely poor up to independence up to 1918.
*  And I think that maybe incubated and kept some of that folk life intact.
*  It was neither industrializing nor westernizing the way the Prussian was.
*  And that's a speculation.
*  It might just be that the paint's better.
*  Speaking of experiments, if you look at a map,
*  you look at Kaliningrad, formerly Koenigsberg,
*  you look at the Sualki Gap.
*  What's the actual equilibrium there?
*  Like territory separated from the mother country, Alaska aside,
*  it tends not to go very well.
*  Most of all in the history of Eastern Europe.
*  What do you expect?
*  Do I expect, you know, Polish tanks storming Konig, the Kant's birthplace?
*  Not really.
*  I think as much as those like,
*  exclaves used to be and still are in Nagorno-Karabakh, very precarious.
*  Being in nuclear power is an awfully big trump card.
*  I can't see any of the countries surrounding that oblast making a big move.
*  I don't think it's even that big of a deal.
*  In Poland, you never talk or think about it a little bit.
*  But I think it's hard for the Russians to stage anything major from there.
*  But it's also hard for any of the surroundings to do a lot against it.
*  So I think it's a curio.
*  I don't think it's the Crimea of the Baltic.
*  I think it'll be an issue, but not a huge issue.
*  But how many Eastern European borders have stayed the same for,
*  say, even 50 or 60 years?
*  The Danube's always been there.
*  The Danube's a good one.
*  Is Bulgaria, Romania, has that been a stable border?
*  Not completely.
*  Not completely, yeah.
*  Part that they swapped post World War II.
*  There was Bulgaria used to, Romania used to cross down
*  and have a little bit more of the Bulgarian, it was now the Bulgarian coast.
*  So there's a piece of southern Debruzsa, I think, that they swapped.
*  But as a whole, the river, you know, it's a great,
*  used to be the frontier of the Roman Empire for a long time.
*  It's still a solid Bulgarian-Romanian border, real linguistic frontier.
*  So that's a solid, long-time frontier.
*  Are there others?
*  The Carpathians are one of the few natural boundaries.
*  That Slovak-Polish border is pretty set for a long time.
*  There's so few stable borders, and the one on the map that looks the weirdest,
*  why not think that will be unstable too?
*  So 80 years from now, I would be shocked if the status quo we're still holding.
*  In Eastern Europe?
*  Well, with Kaliningrad and the Svoboda Gap.
*  I have no idea which way it will flip.
*  That's true, but...
*  But that just seems pretty unlikely.
*  I mean, it's really Russian there, though.
*  There's the, who would take it back?
*  There aren't any Polish people there.
*  There are no Lithuanians.
*  There's a Lithuanian nostalgia for part of it.
*  Part of it had Lithuanian culture that's been almost wiped out.
*  So unless it goes independent...
*  Well, Russia could grow as another possible equilibrium, right?
*  That's possible.
*  We could all be living on a meeting.
*  Maybe not a pleasant one, but it's happened before.
*  It's true.
*  I mean, there's so many other points of affliction, of tension in Moldova and Transnistria and Belarus and Ukraine.
*  That's where I would focus.
*  Kaliningrad, it's odd, but we could kind of, I don't know, it's like the Malta, you could kind of,
*  or Luxembourg, it could kind of maybe exist for a long time, but I'm not sure.
*  These days, why is the food in Poland so good?
*  I'm glad to hear you say that.
*  I don't always think that.
*  It's some of the best food in Europe.
*  It's really good.
*  But you know, like the best food I have in Poland,
*  there's some really good Vietnamese restaurants because there's a Vietnamese minority
*  that comes, goes back to the 70s and 80s.
*  But Polish food is best when it's made by by babiches, by Polish grandmas.
*  So I go to milk bars and it's always the best meal.
*  I was up in the Słowacki Gap two years ago in Słowacki, went to a milk bar, which is a kind of
*  communist relic.
*  They meant that it was a kind of a daytime cafeteria.
*  We would get Polish standards, but you couldn't get any alcohol.
*  And usually in the bad days, they wouldn't let you have the even the utensils,
*  the forks would have two tines so no one would steal them.
*  Great food, very cheap, very good.
*  There are more levels to Polish gastronomy now.
*  You can get really fancy food, you can get incredible artisanal pierogi,
*  but just simple, well-made country homestyle Polish food is fantastic.
*  So is Ukrainian though.
*  20th century Polish poetry.
*  I try reading it as a non-Polish speaker and it doesn't really make sense to me.
*  It seems untranslatable.
*  Is there a way a non-Polish speaker can access the glories of those works?
*  Or is it more or less lost to us like Russian poetry might?
*  No, actually, I think the reverse.
*  I think Polish, so I think there's a split in the 20th century.
*  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I read them in both, but I think a lot of Polish poets, I think there's a
*  the troika of great post-war poets.
*  Wysława Szymborska, Czesław Miewosz, Zbigniew Herbert.
*  I think they work really well on translation and they don't rely on the things that make Russian
*  poetry so hard and older Polish poetry so hard, which is rhythm and meter
*  and extremely untranslatable wordplay.
*  There's a poet I love, Wleszów Leszmian, who's from the early 20th century.
*  He's really barely been translated, extremely difficult even in Polish.
*  Doesn't work at all in English, but I think especially Herbert is so spare in Polish as well.
*  There's so little, it's such a poetry of ideas.
*  I think it comes through really well.
*  Where should a person start?
*  What's your advice?
*  Herbert?
*  There's a little out, I think, Louis Alvarez edited the little, Czesław Miewosz translated.
*  Miewosz, a modern poet, you could start with Hermes Piesk-Wiazda.
*  That's Hermes, dog and star.
*  I think Apollo and Marseus, the poem, is maybe my favorite.
*  So you could just start with that poem specifically.
*  Why isn't Stanisław Lem more popular in the West today as a writer?
*  That's interesting.
*  I grew up on Stanisław Lem, like some people grow up on, you know, the Grimm's fairy tales.
*  My dad's a computer scientist.
*  His father started, like, set up one of Poland's first computers,
*  the world of Polish science and science fiction.
*  So he used to read the Tales of Perks the Pilot and the Eon Tichia stories.
*  The robot, kind of the short, fun ones, like they were fairy tales.
*  So I grew up with them.
*  I think I should have trouble going back to those.
*  I go back to Solaris and I think Solaris is a real masterpiece
*  and I think it's had lasting influence.
*  But they are, there's something pessimistic about them.
*  They don't have that thing that Asimov does.
*  I know we're even dune of world building and forecasting the human future far in advance.
*  They are like, kind of Kafka in space.
*  And that's, you know, absurd situations, strange turns of events.
*  I think a pretty pessimistic view of progress and maybe that makes them hard to digest.
*  And also the kind of odd sense of humor with the short stories.
*  Also childlike sense of humor that makes them hard to dig.
*  I think there's been a little bit of a Lem revival though.
*  I know technologists, some people like them, futurologists like him.
*  Some of the cybernetics tales, they seem weirdly close to the current state of LLMs.
*  And I think I've seen this mentioned once, but it's not generally known.
*  The idea that you use them to talk to, that they're weird,
*  they might be somewhat mystical, they serve as therapists or oracles.
*  That's very much in Lem quite early.
*  I think people should go back to them.
*  I think, you know, I was just thinking Solaris,
*  which I always thought about as this story about contacting a truly alien.
*  Now it's like, well, this is a little bit what we're doing with virtual reality and NAIs.
*  What would happen if you could actually talk to your dreams, if you could revive people,
*  but you could have the mimicry of consciousness,
*  the appearance of consciousness without anything behind it, without a consciousness.
*  And there's something seductive about it and there's something monstrous about it.
*  I think he was there way ahead of anyone else and people should be going back to them.
*  And maybe they will.
*  If we think about Eastern Europe more generally,
*  we're trying to figure out where various lines fall,
*  where the Roman Empire stretched to or not.
*  How much significance do you think that has for the current day?
*  Or has that just been obliterated as a factor?
*  I've actually gone to a lot of provincial museums on the old lemas, on the old frontier.
*  You can go and see that kind of love.
*  I like going to the last Roman fort.
*  You can go to Budapest and see the frontier of the frontier.
*  You can go to go in Slovakia and see the last Roman camp.
*  I don't think it matters in a major way.
*  I think the traces come later.
*  It's where the imprint of Byzantium is still around.
*  The imprint of the East Roman Empire where that and its extensions
*  of its church, that really matters.
*  The world of orthodoxy versus the world of Catholicism.
*  But those lines, there was such an obliteration of the Roman Empire and its legacy,
*  at least in Eastern Europe between the fifth century and the tenth century.
*  Those old lines got obscured and new ones got put in in the 900s and the 1000s.
*  So the fact that so much of Croatia is Catholic rather than Orthodox,
*  should that make us more optimistic about economic growth for Croatia?
*  Or it's just not going to matter?
*  More optimistic.
*  So Slovenia has done extremely well, right?
*  It's essentially at Western European living standards.
*  Croatia is not there, but the fact that it is not dominantly orthodox Christianity,
*  should we then infer it's going to join the Western European community in some fundamental way
*  that perhaps Bulgaria will not?
*  I think we should be optimistic about Croatia.
*  I think the EU is the driver of a lot of that.
*  I don't think we should be that pessimistic about Romania and Bulgaria.
*  I think actually Romania is showing, and that's coming out of communism,
*  a much more rural, much more backward economy than Slovenia.
*  But I think it's growing really fast.
*  I think things are actually really okay there politically.
*  I think that idea of a kind of Orthodox disease is maybe a figment of geography,
*  more than a deeply cultural matrix that we think.
*  I think we could be optimistic about Croatia and Romania simultaneously.
*  Bulgaria, maybe too.
*  I'm not sure that I believe in a kind of Orthodox curse.
*  I think it has more to do with how things shook up internally in former Yugoslavia
*  and where those countries are in relationship to that industrial core of Germany, Austria, Switzerland.
*  How will Romania and Bulgaria in particular deal with depopulation?
*  You can move anywhere, almost anywhere in the EU.
*  Their birth rates are low and probably falling.
*  There's also not so far away North Africa, growing population, a lot of migration using boats.
*  They're closer to that than Finland is.
*  What's that going to look like?
*  How many people will be in those places and where will they come from?
*  Well, Romania's birth rate is pretty high.
*  I think it's along the top of...
*  Maybe I'm a little out of date, but along the top of European birth rates,
*  and probably because it's quite a rural country.
*  They change as they grow, right?
*  And a lot of people have left, will leave.
*  Well, right now there's a huge influx of Ukrainians and probably Moldovans all left.
*  I mean, a quarter of Moldova, Moldova left Moldova.
*  And Romains will also return.
*  I remember a great way to find out what's kind of going under the surface in European labor
*  and migration is go to bus stations, long haul bus stations.
*  I remember trying to catch a bus from Seville to Lisbon,
*  which for whatever reason is really hard.
*  It's not a good connection.
*  But I was at the bus station and there were tons of buses to places like Campulung, Moldova,
*  Neșc, Suceava, Botostani, rural Moldavian cities, the part of Moldova, Moldavia in Romania.
*  So 17, 25 hour bus rides because there's so many Romanians in Spain.
*  And you can see the same thing in Italy, same thing in Portugal.
*  And some of those people are going to come back.
*  A lot of them are coming back and you're going to get an influx from over the border.
*  I mean, right now, Ukraine is going to lose people because of that economy is going to be in,
*  I think, crisis for a long time.
*  The migrants that are coming over overland from Asia,
*  they tend not to stop in the Balkans.
*  That's the throughway for them.
*  Even in Hungary, they are trying to get to Germany, France, Great Britain.
*  Very rarely do the migrants from maybe a little bit.
*  But that's not a major influx because also the living standard gap, I don't think, is big enough.
*  Does Moldavia have a future as an independent nation?
*  Obviously, it's very small.
*  It's next to conflict.
*  Shouldn't they just join Romania and then just be part of the EU?
*  Why isn't that a dominant move for them?
*  That has been a big political movement and that I think they,
*  if they could do it, I think a lot of people would do it.
*  They just renamed their language Romanian.
*  The complicated history of Moldavian as a separate language has maybe come to an end.
*  They, I think they vote in parliament after my book went to press because I talk a little bit
*  about Moldavian language and the Moldavian national anthem.
*  After it was in press, they had this vote and Moldavian is now, I think, officially Romanian.
*  There is a move to, I mean, if they could make it work with Romania, I think a lot of people would
*  do it.
*  Then there's the problem of Transnistria, which would not want to do it, which is much more
*  ethnically Russian and essentially a separatist enclave.
*  So there would be a real problem in how to incorporate it.
*  But Moldavian politics is not split right left.
*  It's split pro-EU, pro-Russia and pro-EU is the dominant force right now.
*  Is there a future for a Serbian comeback where Belgrade again becomes a major transport hub?
*  The country does well.
*  It moves away from flirting with fascism, becomes less close with Putin's Russia.
*  Is there any path you can see for that happening or that's just a pipe dream?
*  A transit hub.
*  Well, it originally was a big transit hub for the Balkans, say 30, 40 years ago,
*  and it was relative to its peer group, quite prosperous.
*  And now you go there, you see nice old buildings, but it feels like it doesn't have much of a
*  future.
*  It's in decline.
*  It is one of the best Balkan cities to party in.
*  It's one of the funnest cities.
*  It has its reinvented itself as a Balkan party center.
*  It really has this incredible culture of discos and these boats, this kind of houseboats on the
*  Danube where people party on.
*  To become a genuine transit hub, I guess they would have to make nice with everybody around
*  them and rebuild.
*  I mean, it is hard to travel around the Balkans now because there's no the rails.
*  There are hardly any long distance railways.
*  I mean, I had a terrible time going from Belgrade to Sarajevo because you don't get sent to
*  Sarajevo.
*  You get sent to Sarajevo that belongs to Republika Srpska, the Serbian part of Bosnia.
*  If they could resolve all their regional conflicts, then yes, that city is in a perfect
*  position.
*  That's why it was so strategic for the Ottomans and the Hungarians and the Yugoslavs.
*  But yeah, it's a political issue.
*  And I think it's one that's not going to be resolved very quickly.
*  Between the Bosnian problems, between Kosovo, it's not happening in a short time.
*  However, the Serbian solution is to be close to Russia and China.
*  So they have increasingly close links to especially China.
*  Maybe they're an island of Chinese influence in the Balkans.
*  It's their future.
*  The Serbian obsession with I guess you'd have to call it the 14th century.
*  Is it an actual historic obsession or is it a stand in for some other class of values?
*  How do you frame that or think about it?
*  So when you ask Serbians about Kosovo, they'll tell you all these long stories about the
*  Serbian heartland is in Kosovo and Kosovo is Serbia.
*  And putting aside whether or not one agrees with any of that, what is it that they really
*  mean when they're saying it?
*  The Battle of the Field of Blackbirds, 1389.
*  It is pivotal in Serbian memory and Serbian mythmaking, that moment, although they really
*  mythologized it, of the great defeat of Serbia at the hands of the Ottomans and then resting
*  a kind of victory by assassinating the Ottoman Sultan in the last second after the battle's
*  been lost.
*  I think there's a real pull of history.
*  There's a real pull of defeat.
*  But in terms of a larger value, it's the dream of Serbia as a great country.
*  Eastern European countries kind of have fallen two categories.
*  There are countries that are small and they're happy being small, so minority.
*  And countries that are small to medium and dream of being big.
*  Poland dreams of being big, but those dreams are less prominent than they used to be.
*  Hungary dreams of being big, of returning to being big.
*  And those dreams are still around.
*  And Serbia dreams of being big.
*  It had that oversized role in Yugoslavia.
*  Yugoslavia was in a way, these are some Serbs, not a Serbian empire, but a big sphere of
*  influence where they were the top dog.
*  They were the big player.
*  The Yugoslav kingdom is very much like that, formed around Serbia.
*  And Kosovo is the last piece of that.
*  It's the last piece of that.
*  Once they lose that and Montenegro, they're really a small country.
*  There really is no more dream.
*  So that's how I read it.
*  RICK So once the United States steps back from that region, which sooner or later will
*  happen, probably not sooner, won't it just become part of Serbia and they'll get their
*  larger nation back?
*  JARED Well, not if greater Albania has anything to say about it.
*  I mean, Kosovo is so dominantly ethnically Albanian.
*  It is a-
*  RICK But that doesn't mean they can defend themselves, right?
*  Or do we get another Balkans war where there's an Albanian ethnic movement for some kind of
*  greater Albania, there's a movement for greater Serbia, the two clash and they end up fighting.
*  JARED I mean, if you go to Kosovo, everywhere you see
*  big silver monuments to the heroes of the 1999 Kosovo War and AL members, that's going to be a
*  horrible, if Serbia were to take over Kosovo, it would be a nightmare insurgency.
*  I mean, maybe Serbia doesn't, I definitely don't think it's worth it, except on a
*  satisfying psychological craving.
*  But, you know, there's a little Serbian majority strip, not a clear majority, but most of the
*  Serbs live close to Serbia, maybe some kind of partial partitioning in the future, but an
*  actual Serbian takeover of Kosovo, I hope that doesn't happen because I think it would be ugly
*  for both sides.
*  RICK Does Albania still have dreams of being something greater and larger?
*  Because if you look at an ethnic map, it at least feels from the picture like maybe it could be.
*  JARED Well, there are a lot of Albanians outside Albania,
*  and it matters to them. I was in Montenegro, and there's an Albanian part of Montenegro that
*  people don't know about, and Nulcin used to be the great Venetian city there, is dominant Albanian.
*  The Macedonia, North Macedonia, has an Albanian majority region, is almost a quarter Albanian,
*  just about a quarter. And then Kosovo is majority Albanian. I know that Albania has
*  expansionist ideas, but they have foreign policy aims. They do have to
*  support their ethnic, their linguistic allies, and there is a lot of intermovement.
*  I mean, Kosovars go back and forth from Albania all the time. Albanians go to Kosovo.
*  That's an open border. It's very easy to cross. The people are constantly pouring across, and
*  those relations are very close. Does Albania have the power, have the ability to project a lot of
*  power into its neighbors? Maybe. I'm not sure. But politically, they do have to stand up for their
*  coethnics. MARK LANDLOW Is there some level of per capita income where you think this all
*  more or less goes away? So you look at the two Irlands, you can't say it's settled,
*  there's no reunification, but it's quite peaceful, and we're just not too worried about it, right?
*  People are not religious, they're fairly well off, whatever the problems may be.
*  Is that the likely future for the Balkans, that they become like the Irlands, and everything
*  festers, but it's just all quite fine because wealth is up? Or do you think it's something
*  darker than that? That everyone's rich and happy and all the problems are Belgian problems that you
*  live with? No one's happy, and Belgium might split up still. But nonetheless, it all feels
*  quite diffused, whether it's Ireland or Belgium. Some people would say Spain. Maybe that's still up
*  for grabs. I think European integration happens the more – maybe this is naive – but the more European
*  integration happens, the more that does lift some of those regional and unclear problems,
*  as you can devolve some things to the EU. If the EU were to expand there, I think it would
*  help a lot of those problems. Is there a specific income level?
*  I mean, they have a long way to go in Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo. I mean, these are the
*  poorest – aside from Moldova, the poorest countries in Europe. So the amount of catching
*  up before you can be Switzerland and all live happily together is pretty big. If they did get
*  there, then maybe they will. I'm sure – I think the temperature would go down. I don't think it's
*  bread and the bone in some way. I think the temperature has been going down.
*  I looked at some data recently. The most rapidly growing economy in Eastern Europe is Poland,
*  no surprise. But number two was Albania, and the place is booming. I mean, what happened there?
*  No one expected that. What have they done right?
*  It's striking. I was in Albania. I really did a deep tour of Albania and the Albanian
*  Albanophone region next to it last year. And you do feel that boom. You can feel there's a lot of
*  Gulf investment and Saudi investment. There's a ton of road building. There's a ton of
*  actually really good cultural infrastructure being built. They're doing a great job with
*  museums and heritage. I was renting a car from somebody, a little Albanian car rental, and the
*  guy told me he spends six months in Albania. The other six months, he goes to Great Britain. He
*  works outside London as a programmer, and he had programmed. He had designed all his
*  car rental agencies programming. I think there's an openness. I think the return migration
*  from Italy and Switzerland and the UK that's doing well. There's enormous untapped tourism
*  potential because it's the last piece of European, like really prime Mediterranean coastline that
*  hasn't been developed deeply, extensively. In a small country, I think that really matters.
*  And what else? I'm not sure. It's under three million people,
*  so small effects can have big consequences.
*  Why are there so few Christian Muslim problems in Albania relative to many other places in the
*  world? There are hardly any. Are they the Qajim Muslims or some other reason?
*  There is a very moderate Sufi strain to Islam there. Although there's some proselytizing by
*  Salafis. It's not just that anymore. There's also two kinds of Christian, the Orthodox South
*  and actually the Catholic North was where all the tribal violence is. Those are the great
*  Catholic hill tribes or the really violent ones that do blood feud. The take on this in Albania is
*  I think one of the main poets said that the religion of Albanians is Albanianism.
*  It's that they're all Albanian. They're all Albanian speaking and it kind of dilutes those
*  differences. There's a lot of intermarriage. The Muslim Islam is very mild and the conflicts run
*  in all different directions. Historically, they're clan based, clan on clan, not religion on religion.
*  The temperature beyond just being this very mild Sufi Islam, the years of official atheism
*  also cooled the temperature on religion a lot. The religion is all three, Catholicism, Orthodoxy,
*  Islam are kind of muted culturally and Albanian national unity is more prominent psychologically.
*  Hungary, what is your read on the current political situation? This has become a political
*  football of sorts amongst the American, right? How bad is it? How far is it straying from
*  either whether it's democracy or rule of law that is itself debated? How should I think about politics
*  in Hungary? Hungary is pretty fascinating. It's like if an American red state were completely
*  captured by one party leader, maybe a, it doesn't have to be a red state, it could be like a Huey
*  Long type figure and who then was powerful enough to start really changing the rules and to always
*  color within the lines technically while changing what those lines are to be able to change the
*  constitution and that kind of legal authoritarianism. I've talked to people who know Orban,
*  knew him as a student, knew him as an activist, as a kind of libertarianish student leader.
*  The thing they all say is that he's incredibly smart, incredibly attuned to incredibly professional
*  politician. He's obsessed with the details of politics. He's obsessed with the details
*  of policy. He's obsessed with the details of self-presentation. He has no particular
*  ideological allegiance. This idea of him as a Christian nationalist
*  is something he came up with too strategically. Everything with him is a strategic calculation on
*  how to build and maintain power, his own power and his party's power. He's extremely good at it.
*  He uses countless small measures that add up to small electoral victories and then takes those
*  small electoral victories and parlay them into huge constitutional and transformational things
*  across Hungary. He controls more and more of the media, more and more of the economy.
*  He's harder and harder to unseat and yet it's not a hard dictatorship.
*  I don't think he would ever fire on crowds. I don't think faced with mass protest he would resort to
*  excessive violence. I don't think he has the support in the police or any of the security services
*  to be that kind of ruler, even if he wanted to be. So it's a strange hybrid.
*  And you think it's broadly compatible with Hungary just staying in the EU,
*  people looking a bit the other way on both sides, but it can just continue or not?
*  I think it's amazing it's gotten to this point and the EU has abetted him effectively. EU funds,
*  which are hugely transformational in Hungary, if you drive around the Hungarian countryside,
*  every, it's kind of annoying because every 500 meters it feels like you come to a roundabout
*  under construction pointlessly. And that's all EU money and it's all under the control of companies
*  that construction firms essentially act as extensions of Fidesz and Orbán's power.
*  They control as a party this tap of money and that helps solidify their power. So the EU
*  effectively helps fund their dominance as a political movement, as a political party.
*  And to me it's strange that it's gotten to the point that it's gotten, but unless there's a big
*  movement in Hungarian society, which has tended to be pretty quiescent,
*  I don't know how the EU would really or why the EU would decisively step in.
*  And the things that have gotten people really out in the streets in Hungary,
*  one of the big ones was when internet prices were going to go up and they back down. He tends to
*  back down when there's a big protest. He does respond to that signal, but they keep the
*  temperature pretty low in Hungary. Why are so many Hungarians so concerned with Trijanaan,
*  the loss of territory? Who cares? Why should they care? What are they hoping to get?
*  I don't think they care literally. I think it's a little bit remember the Alamo.
*  By this point has moved into the realm of national symbols and symbology. You will see the
*  Trijanaan belt buckles for sale and people wearing them where you have free Trijanaan,
*  big Hungary, you can have a big silver one as a kind of like Texas style belt buckle.
*  I don't think that literally means that people wear those. Does that literally mean they want
*  Bacska back from Serbia, that they want Southern Slovakia back from Slovakia?
*  Not exactly. They're one of those Eastern European countries that's small, but dreams of being big.
*  They still have that sense of being robbed, which in a way they were. Since that their historical
*  destiny was denied and Orbán will play with that a little bit. He will suggest that maybe
*  if Ukraine were to fall apart, it's about to fall apart. Maybe there's a little corner of Ukraine,
*  those ones Hungarian over on the other side of the Carpathians. Maybe they should get that back,
*  but that's more in the realm of dreams and symbols, not actual foreign policy aspirations.
*  I don't think there's, it's something, it is a little bit like the way Texans are about Texas.
*  Hungarians are about Hungary, but I'm not sure it's totally, we should read that totally literally.
*  So all the study of Eastern Europe, all the time you spent there, well, Greater Poland earlier,
*  Greater Lithuania, maybe Greater Serbia, Greater Albania, Greater Hungary.
*  How has it shaped your view of just human nature flat out? Is it that you think, well,
*  what I see in Eastern Europe is a bit of an outlier, or do you actually start seeing the
*  rest of the world more in those terms? How has it shaped your general views of humanity?
*  If I can give you a little longer answer, it has shaped a view of humanity.
*  And the part, but the part that has the most isn't the kind of petty, I think a little bit petty
*  national aspirations. It's not Lithuanian dreams of getting a little bit of Poland back or Hungarian
*  dreams of getting the Batchka back. The part that's really struck me deeply is the Holocaust.
*  Is, so my family, a lot of them went through the Holocaust in Poland and studying the German
*  occupation of especially Poland, where the Jews were so much, and the process, what happened there
*  after the ghetto clearances, after 41. And I think there's a real message about human nature there.
*  And sometimes it's people who talk about that will talk about, well, this is a Polish-Jewish
*  thing. This is about anti-Semitism. I think there's actually something deeper. So after 19, so there
*  are kind of three phases to the Holocaust in Poland. There's an early phase of people are
*  being rounded up and put into ghettos. And then after, in 1941, the Germans invade the Soviet Union,
*  and a few months of Operation Barbarossa, and a few months later, they start clearing the ghettos
*  out. They start the real process of eliminating Poland's Jews and shooting people outright,
*  shooting people as they're invading, and rounding people up, taking them from ghettos
*  to concentration camps where they're gassed and killed. And then there's this period.
*  And so that's when most of the actual murder and death happens.
*  Murder and death happens. And so, but then from late 1941 to early 1945,
*  there's a small group of survivors in Poland, Polish Jews, who
*  are in peril from all sides, have no legal standing, are non-persons, can be hunted by anyone,
*  can be killed by anyone, and have to find a way to survive. And this truly
*  a true Hobbesian world, where food is becoming scarcer and scarcer, money is scarce, everything
*  is scarce, and a real world of poverty, because they're surviving usually in, some people have
*  false papers and can survive anywhere, hopefully, as long as they're not denounced. Some people have
*  a lot of money and can use that for themselves. But the ones who escaped from the ghetto or were
*  surviving or ran away from transports or otherwise just out at sea in Poland,
*  have to usually make a bargain with somebody, have to find someone and they can trade whatever they
*  have, whatever money they have, whatever they can promise for shelter. And they do, and a lot of
*  people did that. And it's hard to know exactly how many, but a lot of people did that in 42.
*  And then the war goes on and on, much longer than people expected, 42, 43, 44, winter after winter,
*  things getting harder and harder. And the longer that runs, the more this becomes a real kind of
*  experiment in human nature, who survives and who doesn't, who is denounced and who doesn't.
*  I had family members who actually survived this way, miraculously, but some didn't. And what I
*  find in the short run, a lot of people will make that bargain and be like, I'll take your money
*  and I'll put you up. I'll put you in my cellar. I'll hide you in a room for a few months, for a
*  year, for two years. But the longer that goes, the riskier it becomes and the harder it becomes.
*  And the more there's a temptation to say, actually, I'm going to give you up. My neighbors can see
*  this. I can't go on with this. I need the money. I'm too scared. It just doesn't seem like a point.
*  So if the war had been shorter, a lot more people would have been saved. And the longer the war runs,
*  the more people are either denounced by their neighbors or their own protectors denounce them.
*  But the ones who are saved in the long run, this is where the human nature comes in.
*  What's so interesting is the kind of, so how do you know who to trust? And the people who end up
*  protecting the people they protect the longest, hold out the longest, hold out to the end,
*  are usually people who live on the absolute margins. People who
*  widows outcast, people with no money, people in terrible shape, people whose lives would be
*  transformed by having an iron stove or a pair of pants. But if you were to take that, when you're
*  hiding Jews, and you were to take their money and buy something like that, immediately all your
*  neighbors would know what you're doing. Because every village is a hundred eyes watching everybody
*  else. So you make one move, you make one change, you buy a tin roof. Everyone knows what you're
*  doing. Everyone knows you're hiding a Jew. But the people who were the best at saving the people
*  they saved tended to be people who never made a bargain, who never asked for money, who just did
*  it out of moral instinct. Because if you buy a life, you can sell it. And the people who didn't
*  enter into that transaction, they held fast the strongest. So, but how would you know that?
*  Because just as possible, those people come on the margins will also like, you know, they can
*  denounce someone for a tiny reward for a bottle of vodka for a kilo of sugar. Those are some of the
*  rewards that people get. And if you were to ask them beforehand, how would you act in this situation?
*  What would you do? I don't think they'd have any idea what they would do. I don't think they could
*  predict themselves how they would act. And that's where you get at the human mystery. I think
*  you don't know. Some people have that moral instinct. Some people will do it out of
*  an innate feeling, but most won't. And to me, that means human nature is in some ways completely
*  plastic, has no bottom, has no backstop. Most people in the right situation, in the wrong
*  situation, the worst situation will act in any way, behave in any way. I think there's almost no
*  bottom to human behavior. And the flip side of that is in the worst situation, some people will
*  act in the most remarkable way, in the best way. And there's kind of no way to know. So it's really,
*  I mean, to me, although I'm not primarily an historian of the Holocaust, that's the lesson
*  I take away. I'm sorry for a very long answer. Oh, that's great. Given all your study of Eastern
*  Europe, what is it you feel you understand about the current war in Ukraine that maybe other well
*  informed people would not? What do I understand about the war in Ukraine? I'll tell you what,
*  that Ukraine, what Ukraine is, has shifted over time and is continuing to shift. I think people
*  who look at this war and started being aware of it in 2022, Ukraine is just a natural fact,
*  and they weren't necessarily sure what it is or where it comes from. I think there is such a
*  complicated story of Ukraine between Poland and especially Russia, of being entangled with both of
*  those and creating itself in relation and against both of those. It's kind of a tangled family tree.
*  And seeing how the pendulum has shifted, even in a couple of years, in the relationships between
*  those three countries, where it was actually kind of historically very tense between Poland and
*  Ukraine and the Polish government, which is always looking for something in the past to take a old
*  wound to come back and celebrate and show off about. They're really showing off about
*  celebrating, but commemorating the Polish-Ukrainian violence in World War II was a major
*  thing kind of platform of like, remember what the Ukrainians did to us. And in a flash, it's come
*  switched to Poles and Ukrainians, brothers, so the big enemy. And there's more to that.
*  Like, just growing up, I don't know, Khmelnytskyi and who he is to Ukrainians and Poles,
*  that these are entangled stories. But do I actually understand the course of the war better?
*  And do I have a prediction for it? And did I understand it better when it started?
*  Probably not. I feel like I understand some of the roots.
*  And the roots don't predict that well. So maybe I don't have that much insight. Looking forward.
*  In Eastern Europe, sexual dimorphism, maybe especially in parts of the Balkans,
*  is it likely to go up or down? So a lot of men, they at least put on an air, there's some kind
*  of manly man, and they work out, they lift weights, they have muscles. Women, there's a particular set
*  of roles. And Putin in particular, but many other leaders there, like to attack the West for confusing
*  the roles of men and women. Is that going to intensify in the East or that's just going to
*  go away as per capita income rises? And they'll feminize too.
*  Well, they haven't started yet. The Balkan male ethic is alive and well,
*  at least to this observer. And they're also just gigantic people down in former Yugoslavia.
*  You know, maybe Greece would be the place to track. I don't think Greek men have followed some kind of
*  postmodern, Wilbeckian course. I think we're a long way off from losing the Balkan male
*  as a natural species. I think we can improve the economy a lot and that male culture,
*  that ethos is going to be around for a while. I don't think they have anything to worry about.
*  Last two questions. First, an educated American comes to you and says,
*  Jacob designed for me a two week vacation in Eastern Europe, but forget about Budapest and
*  Prague. They've already been there. They're not going to go or they want to go anyway.
*  For two weeks, where do you send them? What's the itinerary?
*  And ask one, is war a concern? Is Ukraine on the table?
*  They're not going to go to Ukraine, whether they should or not, right?
*  Not a shame. And Budapest is off the table. So I selfishly will start you in Warsaw,
*  because I love Warsaw and I'm a Warsawvian. And Warsaw is derided, but actually one of
*  Eastern Europe's most interesting cities. And you get that history. The architecture is not great,
*  but the history is right there under the surface. If you know what you're looking for,
*  good airport too. And then I would send you south
*  down to the mountains and skip crack on the same basis as over-tourists did, although it's wonderful.
*  As Prague and Budapest go down to Przemysl near the Ukrainian border and get a sense of that old
*  Habsburg infrastructure and get a whiff of that, that you're right on the border of Ukraine. You're
*  right on the border of Ukrainian influence and that you're in that old Eastern Orthodox part of
*  Poland, which used to be. You can go to Sanok too, and the wonderful museums there. And then
*  down through Slovakia, through Eastern Slovakia, the kind of Ruthenian Slovakia.
*  So the parts of these Catholic countries are Eastern Orthodox and into
*  Northern Romania. Northern Romania is the best place to see traditional Eastern Europe,
*  to see the world of haymaking and hand-built
*  houses and the land of hay and wood. Maramures is my favorite area. Maramures is kind of proverbially
*  poor, northernmost hat of Romania. It's the village I love called Breb, but the whole valley of Ude
*  is one of the most lastening traditional parts of Eastern Europe. And you can get a taste of what
*  things might have been like 30 years ago, 100 years ago. I think we are we too late,
*  then maybe down to Bucharest? You have a few more days left. Yeah. We have a few more days left.
*  Yeah, let's go to another place or two. Let's go around Transylvania, which is beautiful
*  and has plenty of places to stay. Sibiu is great, but I like
*  actually outside. Inclusion is interesting, but Viscry, Biertan, these places that used to be
*  German, they have these fortified churches and usually there's a cool Hungarian nobleman's house
*  that you can stay in. Prince Charles loves this area and has these refurbished castles that he
*  owns or manor houses that you can stay in. And it's really neat. And Transylvania is also one of the
*  most culturally diverse places in Eastern Europe. And you have real Roma life that a lot of
*  formerly German towns are now mostly inhabited by Gabor Roma, Seventh-day Adventist Roma. It's pretty
*  neat. And you can go down to Bucharest. No, you know what? I'm gonna call an audible. If you can,
*  if we can get across the border, let's go to Belgrade and go to one of those houseboats
*  and have a great, have some great risotto. I have a place, some great
*  meat burek and party on a houseboat on a berat from the Danube. We can finish there.
*  Belgrade is another. Yeah. Very last question. Just to repeat though to everyone, Jacob's book,
*  Goodbye Eastern Europe, an intimate history of a divided land. I'm a big fan of this book,
*  one of my favorite of this year. But finally, what will you do next?
*  I am going to file my dissertation after an ungodly amount of time in between writing the book.
*  I went back to it, dumped most of it, rewrote it and took it on a different topic and it's done.
*  And I can file it probably this month. And what's that on? It's on Ketman. This idea from the
*  captive mind, Batchezov Milos of ideological masquerade or disguise that he took from,
*  it's a concept in Shiite Islamic practice that he wrote about where Shiites under duress,
