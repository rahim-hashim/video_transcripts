# Noam Chomsky on Language, Left Libertarianism, and Progress  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk2pVd9Wdiw)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm chatting with Noam Chomsky, who needs no introduction.
*  Noam, welcome.
*  Good to be with you.
*  If I think of your thought and I compare it to the thought of Wilhelm von Humboldt, what's
*  the common ontological element in both of your thoughts that leads you to more or less agree
*  on both language and liberty?
*  Well, Wad Humboldt was first of all a great linguist who recognized some fundamental principles
*  of language which were rare at the time and are only beginning to be understood.
*  But in the social and political domain, he was not only the founder of the modern research
*  but also one of the founders of classical liberalism.
*  His fundamental principle, as he said, it's actually an epigram for John Stuart Mills
*  on liberty, is that the fundamental right of every person is to be free from external
*  illegitimate constraints, free to inquire, create, pursue, people to pursue their own
*  interests and concerns without arbitrary authority of any sort restricting and limiting them.
*  You've argued that Humboldt was a Platonist of some kind, that he viewed learning as some
*  notion of reminiscence.
*  Are you in the same regard also a Platonist?
*  Well, Leibniz pointed out that Plato's theory of reminiscence was basically correct,
*  but it had to be purged of the error of reminiscence.
*  In other words, not an earlier life, but rather something intrinsic to our nature.
*  Leibniz couldn't have proceeded as we can today, but now we would say something that
*  has evolved and has become intrinsic to our nature.
*  For people like Humboldt, what was crucial to our nature was what is sometimes called
*  the instinct for freedom.
*  The basic fundamental human property should lie at the basis of our social and economic
*  reasoning and it's also the critical property of human language and thought, as was recognized
*  in the early scientific revolution.
*  Galileo, Leibniz, and later people like Humboldt in the Romantic era, the fundamental
*  property of human language is this unique capacity to create unboundedly many new thoughts
*  in our minds and even to be able to convey to others who have no access to our minds
*  their innermost workings.
*  Galileo himself thought the alphabet was the most spectacular of human inventions because
*  it provided a means to carry out this miracle.
*  Humboldt's formulation was that language enables language and thought, which were always pretty
*  much identified.
*  Language enables what he called infinite use of finite means.
*  We have finite system.
*  We make unbounded use of it.
*  Those conceptions weren't very well understood until the mid 20th century with the development
*  of the theory of computation by Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, other great mathematicians in
*  the 1930s and 40s.
*  But now the concept of finite means that provide infinite scope is quite well understood.
*  In fact, everyone has it in their laptop by now.
*  Was it the distinction between natural and artificial language that led Rousseau astray
*  on politics?
*  So you're a left libertarian.
*  Rousseau is in some ways almost a totalitarian, right?
*  Rousseau is a very mixed character.
*  He's not a systematic thinker.
*  You can find all sorts of things in Rousseau.
*  So if you look at the second discourse on inequality, it's highly libertarian deriving
*  from basically Cartesian principles about the uniqueness and creativity of human thought
*  and language onto a fairly libertarian conception of social organization.
*  That's one Rousseau.
*  You can always also find a very different one.
*  Why are you skeptical of evolutionary approaches to language?
*  I'm not.
*  I'm skeptical of mistaken misunderstandings of evolution, which lead to all sorts of errors
*  in thinking about how language evolved.
*  So in the modern period, 20th century, mainly under the impact of behaviorism, some other
*  tendencies, misunderstood version of Darwinism, it was, has generally came to be believed
*  and still is believed in many quarters, that human language and the language thought, first
*  the language was not, was the tradition from classical Greece up through the 19th century
*  was that language is fundamentally an instrument of thought.
*  Thought is what is generated by language.
*  Language generates thought.
*  They're intimately related, if not indistinguishable.
*  Language was described as audible thought.
*  Need not be audible, we know now.
*  20th century change that under behaviorist influences came to be thinking of language
*  as basically an instrument of communication, which evolved from animal systems.
*  Every animal down to bacteria has some kind of communication system.
*  Even trees communicate.
*  So the assumption is, well, language is just a more developed human language, is a more
*  developed form of communication.
*  I think we have, it's controversial, but my own view is that recent work shows that the
*  tradition was quite right, that that's not the way human language and thought evolved
*  at all.
*  They evolved in quite a different way, which is completely consistent with the actual theory
*  of evolution, not the naive version that's often believed.
*  So it may be, for example, that natural selection played very little or almost no role in the
*  evolution of language and thought.
*  But that's quite consistent with the theory of evolution.
*  Many other things happen in evolution beyond natural selection.
*  And in fact, it's pretty good evidence for that.
*  We have only fragmentary evidence from the archaeological record, but it's pretty clear
*  by now that humans appeared on Earth very recently, modern humans, two to three hundred
*  thousand years ago.
*  So nothing in evolutionary time.
*  We now have genomic analysis, pretty sound, that shows that the small modern homo sapiens
*  groups that emerged very quickly began to separate quickly again in evolutionary time,
*  maybe 50,000 years.
*  We know that they all share the faculty of language and thought.
*  There seems to be no distinction among living humans in this regard, including the descendants
*  of those who separated maybe 150,000 years ago.
*  Would that indicate that these capacities were already in place before the separation?
*  Well, if you look in the archaeological record, prior to the appearance of modern humans,
*  there's almost no evidence of any more than very superficial symbolic activity, not notches on a
*  bone or something like that.
*  Not long after the appearance of humans, you start getting extremely rich records of
*  advanced creative activity.
*  The cave paintings, for example, which are pretty remarkable.
*  I was lucky enough to be able to get into Lascaux before it was sealed.
*  And it's astonishing.
*  You can understand why Picasso, when he saw it, said,
*  we haven't learned anything in tens of thousands of years.
*  Lascaux is fairly recent, maybe 30,000 years ago.
*  But no, it goes back to maybe 80,000 years.
*  These seem like long numbers, but in evolutionary time, these are a flick of an eye.
*  Well, what does all this suggest?
*  Suggests that something happened along with the appearance of modern humans,
*  namely the emergence of these capacities that we're talking about, that amazed Galileo,
*  Humboldt, and others.
*  And nothing's changed since.
*  There's been no change that we can detect in the
*  nature of these cognitive capacities, which seem to be species properties of humans
*  in the technical sense, meaning common to all humans apart from extreme pathology
*  and completely unique.
*  Nothing like them anywhere in the animal world.
*  Well, misunderstandings of Darwinian evolution
*  lead you to think that this is inconsistent with it.
*  It's actually quite consistent with the modern theory of evolution.
*  Darwin did have a famous statement saying that
*  all evolutionary changes have to be very small.
*  He even said, if this turns out not to be true, my total theory collapses.
*  Well, it's now known that that's just not true.
*  There are major changes that take place suddenly.
*  A lot is known about this.
*  One of them may well have been, seems to have been, whatever happened pretty much along with the
*  appearance of modern humans, which provided these capacities, which again have no analog
*  in the animal world and are common to the species.
*  Now you've been very critical of large language models.
*  There's a recent essay by Stefan Wolfram where he argues the success of those models
*  is actually evidence for your theory of language, that they must in some way be picking up
*  or detecting an underlying structure to language because their means are otherwise too limited
*  to be successful.
*  What's your response to that view?
*  He's a brilliant scientist.
*  I've talked to him sometimes.
*  I think this is partly true, but partly misleading.
*  The large language models have a fundamental property which demonstrates that they cannot
*  tell you anything about language and thought.
*  Very simple property.
*  It's built in.
*  Principle can't be modified.
*  Namely, they work just as well for impossible languages as for possible languages.
*  It's kind of as if somebody came along with a new periodic table of the elements,
*  which included all the elements and all impossible elements and couldn't make any
*  distinction on them.
*  It would tell us nothing about chemistry.
*  That's what large language models are.
*  You give them a data set that violates all the principles of language.
*  It would do fine.
*  It doesn't make any distinction.
*  What the systems do basically is scan an astronomical amount of data,
*  find statistical regularities, string things together.
*  Using these regularities, they can make a pretty good prediction about what word is
*  likely to come next after a sequence of words.
*  A lot of very clever programming, a lot of massive computer power, and of course,
*  unbelievable amounts of data.
*  But as I say, does exactly as well with impossible systems as with languages.
*  So therefore, in principle, it's telling you nothing about language.
*  There is something like all organisms.
*  We have innate capacities.
*  There's something about our genetic endowment that determines that the embryo grows arms,
*  not wings.
*  And there's something about the genetic endowment that says that
*  an infant, a newborn infant, can instantly pick out parts of the noise that surrounds it
*  and say to itself, those parts are language.
*  And I'm going to, not consciously, of course, it's all totally reflexive.
*  These parts are language.
*  I'm going to pursue a course of maturation, will determine course of maturation.
*  Which means that by about two or three years old, I've basically absorbed the fundamentals
*  of language.
*  You can take a smartest chimpanzee or the dogs under my desk, they can listen to this
*  noise forever.
*  They have no idea there's anything there but noise.
*  Well, that's a fundamental property of humans built in.
*  It's the reason why you and I can be having this discussion now, but a troop of chimpanzees
*  can't be.
*  Do you think your critiques of media and the idea of manufacturing consent in any way spring
*  from your underlying views on language?
*  More from my views on social and political structure.
*  In fact, the phrase manufacturing consent was not mine.
*  I borrowed it from Walter Lippman, who was, as you know, the leading public intellectual
*  of the 20th century.
*  Good liberal, the Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy liberal.
*  He was a member of the of Woodrow Wilson's, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the
*  Wilson's, uh, propaganda, uh, machine.
*  Wilson, uh, I don't want to tell you this, you know it better as well as I do, but for
*  the record, Wilson was elected in 1916 on a pacifist program.
*  I'm going to keep you at a war.
*  U.S. population didn't want to get into the European war.
*  Uh, very quickly he decided that the United States should enter the war on the allied
*  side and had a problem.
*  How do you turn a pacifist problem population into raving anti-German maniacs?
*  Succeeded brilliantly.
*  Part of the device was a commission that, uh, Wilson set up called the committee on
*  public information, which of course means disinformation, creel commission, as it was
*  called.
*  Walter Lippman was a member of it.
*  Another member of it was Edward Bernays, who went on to be one of the main founders of
*  the public relations industry.
*  Both Wilson and Bernays were very impressed with how what Lippman called
*  manufacturer of consent, Bernays called engineering of consent, how these techniques
*  could, uh, control the public shape opinion completely, uh, turn them into, in this case,
*  a fanatic anti-German, uh, uh, people who want to kill everything German.
*  Can't say Frankfurt or have to say hot dog.
*  You have to kill, put all the, I mean, change your name if you're German to something
*  else.
*  Also a huge attack on labor came out of it was very effective for the corporate sector.
*  They meant to smash the labor unions with all kinds of claims of anti-patriotism and
*  so on.
*  Well, Lippman in particular was very persuaded by this as Bernays was Lippman called it a
*  new art in the practice of democracy.
*  It's important to understand that the both Lippman and Bernays and adopted the standard
*  liberal position that the population is stupid as the terms were stupid and ignorant.
*  They don't know what's good for them.
*  We, the responsible men have to do the planning and the, and the for their benefit, of course.
*  And meanwhile, we have to, as Lippman put it, protect ourselves from the roar and the
*  trampling of the bewildered herd, the very Leninist doctrine, if you think of it, very
*  similar rhetoric that goes right up to the present distinction that was made in the Kennedy
*  years between what were called the technocratic and policy oriented intellectuals, the good guys
*  who worked on policy and so on.
*  And the value oriented intellectuals, the bad guys, what McGeorge Bundy called the wild men
*  in the wings who talk about ridiculous things like justice and rights and so on.
*  This is a very consistent property of the intellectual classes from way back, pretty
*  much independent of political commitment.
*  In any event, manufacture of consent was, just to quote some more Lippman, they said,
*  the public have to be, can be spectators, but not participants in action.
*  They are not supposed to take part in any of public affairs.
*  We do that.
*  As Reinhold Niebuhr put it, they have to be fed the necessary illusions and emotionally potent
*  oversimplifications while we take care of things for the common good.
*  One aspect of this was separating the economy from public affairs.
*  Economists played a major role in this, including liberal economists, mainly liberal economists,
*  separate the economy, which is just pure science.
*  We take care of the science.
*  Public should have nothing to do with it.
*  All of these are major strains in modern thought.
*  They have much earlier origins.
*  In the book that Edward Herman and I wrote about manufacturing consent, we
*  developed it, selected these conceptions, looked at the structure of the media, tried to show that,
*  in fact, the institutional structure of the media, these conceptions of the nature of
*  the intellectual world combined to yield a very effective propaganda system.
*  You seem to be relatively optimistic about the future, but if human beings are so susceptible
*  to propaganda, why be so optimistic?
*  Shouldn't you just think we're stuck in a continual illusory equilibrium where people feed us BS and
*  we just keep on believing it?
*  I wish I could say that I was relatively optimistic.
*  If you look at the way the world is going today, it's extremely hard to be optimistic.
*  I mean, we are facing two enormous crises.
*  There's a reason why the doomsday clock of the bulletin of atomic scientists was
*  recently moved to 90 seconds to midnight.
*  One is the growing threat of nuclear war, which will be terminal war.
*  Another is the failure to take the necessary and feasible steps to deal with
*  an existential crisis of environmental destruction.
*  We're moving in the opposite direction of both and there's not a lot of time.
*  The leadership elements across the board around the world, very few exceptions,
*  are dedicated to racing to the precipice as quickly as possible.
*  That's not much grounds for optimism.
*  Nevertheless, there are grounds.
*  If you look over history, people have organized, resisted, stood up,
*  overthrown repressive autocratic structures, created a broader
*  reign of freedom and justice.
*  Plenty of awful things remain.
*  If you look back at what used to be perfectly acceptable, you can see we've come a long way,
*  even just in the last couple of decades.
*  So go back to the 1960s, for example.
*  In the 1960s, the United States had anti-miscegenation laws.
*  Which were so extreme that the Nazis refused to accept them.
*  We had federally mandated housing segregation.
*  That meant that Afro-American, Black Americans, maybe in the growth period of the 1950s and 60s,
*  Black men could get a job at a decent job at an auto plant.
*  But he couldn't buy one of the homes in Levittown.
*  He couldn't.
*  And of course, wealth in the United States for most people is property owning.
*  So the Black population was cut out from this opportunity in the 50s and 60s to enter into,
*  at some level at least, into mainstream American society by segregated federal
*  laws, which mandated segregation less in the late 60s.
*  Women's rights.
*  Women were still in the 1960s under federal law, not regarded as peers.
*  Basically regarded as kind of property.
*  It wasn't until 1975 that the Supreme Court finally
*  ruled that women have the right to serve on a federal jury, for example, being peers.
*  All sorts of changes have taken place.
*  Countries much more civilized than it was just 50 or 60 years ago.
*  Well, it didn't happen by magic.
*  It happened by lots of popular struggle.
*  You go back in history, there's more and more examples of that.
*  And you can see it right now.
*  I mean, I mentioned that the leadership class is racing to disaster.
*  But there's a lot of activism among the public, mainly young people,
*  saying we insist on a better future.
*  You see it at the COP meetings, you know, the regular meetings, COP 26, 27.
*  There's actually two meetings going on.
*  Like in Glasgow, last time was Sharm el-Sheikh, so far away, nobody could come.
*  But in Glasgow, there was a meeting going on inside the halls where the elegant ladies
*  and gentlemen were doing nothing.
*  And outside in the streets, there were tens of thousands of young people demonstrating,
*  saying we have to take steps to prevent the disaster that you all know is coming
*  from heating the environment.
*  And we demand it and insist on it.
*  Well, one of those meetings is a reason for pessimism.
*  The other is a reason for optimism.
*  Steve McLaughlin On nuclear war, what has been your opinion
*  of the doctrines of Thomas Schelling?
*  Thomas Schelling It's okay.
*  I mean, at an abstract level, yes, you can talk about these things.
*  Fact of the matter is that even contemplating the possibility of nuclear war is insane,
*  literally insane.
*  There cannot be a nuclear war between major powers.
*  The country that launches a first strike will be destroyed, even if there's no retaliatory strike,
*  just from the effects of nuclear winter.
*  There's a lot of casual talk about these things.
*  And, you know, Schelling can carry out his game theoretic analyses and so on.
*  But the basic point is every step has to be taken to ensure that there is no possibility
*  of this happening.
*  There are people who understand that.
*  People like former Defense Secretary William Perry, for example,
*  who's spent his whole life in the nuclear establishment in the state system.
*  He says he's terrified, doubly terrified, terrified once because we're
*  racing towards disaster day by day, doubly terrified because there's no attention
*  being given to it.
*  Sometimes it's just astonishing.
*  So the Pew polling agency a couple of weeks ago came out with they give regular studies
*  of public attitudes on all sorts of things, very valuable.
*  The latest one, they gave people a couple of dozen choices of issues and asked them
*  to rank them in terms of urgency.
*  Nuclear war was not even on the list.
*  Climate change was on the list.
*  It was ranked at the bottom of the 21 choices.
*  That's manufacture of consent in a form which is going to destroy us all.
*  Why does the whole left libertarian tradition, at least to me, seem to be so weak today?
*  So if I mention Rudolf Rocker to someone, the chance they have heard of him is extremely
*  small.
*  I'm sure you experienced the same.
*  Maybe they've heard of him because they've read your writings.
*  But to have heard of him separately, that hardly ever happens.
*  The new left of the 1960s mostly has vanished.
*  How and why did that happen?
*  I don't think it's true.
*  I think the new left of the 1960s, which incidentally was a very brief period, it's
*  it's scattered, splintered, but it left a major imprint.
*  What I've just described was largely an effect of the new left of the 60s.
*  Chain, it civilized the society in many ways.
*  Things were just taken for granted in the 60s.
*  You couldn't possibly even say no.
*  Well, that's the effect of the activism of mostly young people.
*  What was called the new left.
*  So it's not a movement, but it's all over the place.
*  It's changed the way we see and think of things.
*  Almost everybody.
*  It's libertarian socialism, ranarchism.
*  Of course, they're not going to be popular.
*  We have a class-based society, rigid class-based society.
*  The business classes, the ultra-rich are dedicated to class war.
*  They're basically vulgar Marxists, values inverted, constantly fighting a harsh class war.
*  They control the resources, control the institutions, control the economy.
*  So yes, ideas that they don't like, you don't hear.
*  Nothing novel about that.
*  Go back to George Orwell, one of his essays he wrote about how in England, it was said in free England,
*  unpopular ideas can be suppressed without the use of force, just because of the class nature of the society
*  and the subordination of intellectuals to power.
*  Incidentally, his essay was suppressed just to make it a little more dramatic,
*  found later in his unpublished essays.
*  If I think of some of the new left critics of say the Cold War, the revisionists,
*  you have Seymour Melman, Pentagon Capitalism, Sidney Lenz, D.F. Fleming.
*  I'm sure you knew many or all of these people.
*  To me, they sound, if anything, more like the Trumpian right than, say, the left.
*  Right. Then say the Democratic Party.
*  There's been this odd inversion where foreign policy ideas, fears of, you know,
*  a deep state manipulating the system.
*  Those have shifted to the Trumpists.
*  What do you make of that?
*  How do you feel?
*  Well, the revisionists didn't talk about a deep state.
*  They talked about the existing public institutions.
*  The corporate sector, which has overwhelming role in determining state policy.
*  The military industrial system, which is a large part of the economy.
*  You read people like the main writers at the time, Gabriel Kalko, others.
*  They were talking about how this determines the nature of policy.
*  The nature of policy.
*  Doesn't sound at all like the new right has some of that rhetoric, but it's a joke.
*  The right wing of the Republican Party are just servile worshipers of the very rich
*  and the corporate sector.
*  Just take a look at their legislative programs.
*  During the Trump years, there was one major legislation
*  what Joseph Stiglitz called the Donor Relief Act of 2017.
*  A tax cut that was a gift to the super rich and the corporate sector
*  at the expense of everyone else.
*  Take a look at their programs right now.
*  Main programs are, first of all, guarantee that as a red line,
*  you cannot touch the huge Trump tax cut.
*  Now what you have to do is defund the Internal Revenue Service.
*  Why?
*  Because they go after tax cheats who are the wealthy and the privileged.
*  Can't do that.
*  We have to protect them, save them.
*  Meanwhile, what Trump managed to do pretty effectively is,
*  like a good demagogue, is stand up with a banner in one hand
*  that tells working people, I love you,
*  while with the other hand you stab them in the back.
*  That's basically the policy.
*  When you look at foreign policy, Tucker Carlson and the rest who say,
*  we don't want to waste money in Europe,
*  but there's a bottom line to that.
*  We want to save our resources for a war against China.
*  It's insane.
*  I mean, you're right about the Democrats.
*  They're foreign policy.
*  The group is in the hands of basically old neocons, neoconservatives.
*  That's true, the group of Biden, but the GOP is much more dangerous.
*  If I look back on someone like Susan Sontag,
*  she becomes, it seems to be a Maoist.
*  Why is it that left libertarianism touches her and many others so little?
*  What's the appeal of Maoism?
*  Isn't that the opposite of left libertarianism and what you stand for?
*  There was a tendency in what's called among left intellectuals,
*  late 60s, early 70s, to flirt with Maoism.
*  They had no idea what it was.
*  It was a very mixed story.
*  I mean, it had very brutal, harsh elements, destructive elements.
*  There are also aspects of Maoism which aren't discussed much here,
*  though scholarship is aware of them.
*  One of the things that the Maoist policies did was save 100 million people.
*  100 million people were saved from death and starvation
*  as compared with democratic capitalist India in the same years.
*  You look from 1979, 1949 liberation to 1979.
*  Compare the demographics of the two countries.
*  There's a gap of 100 million people killed in India as compared with China
*  simply because of the lack of carrying out rural development and health care programs.
*  There's no big secret about this.
*  It's discussed by some of the leading scholars like Amartya Sen, for example,
*  Nobel laureate in economics.
*  He was just one of his main specialties, hardly obscure, but you don't hear about it.
*  That's manufacture of consent again.
*  But this is not why people like people on the left flirted with Maoism.
*  They had all sorts of confused ideas about Maoism.
*  In fact, if you want the most enthusiastic Maoist in the country,
*  his name happens to be Henry Kissinger.
*  He adored Mao.
*  He worshipped him.
*  If you want a picture of this, I urge that you take a look at
*  a very important scholarly work that just appeared, Carolyn Eisenberg's
*  extensive detailed study of the Nixon-Kissinger years using extensive archival material.
*  One of the things that comes out is Kissinger's starry-eyed adoration for Mao.
*  He himself was a terrible psychopath, but for Mao in particular.
*  Which do you feel has seen a better trajectory if you compare the two countries,
*  Nicaragua, which has experimented partially with socialism,
*  and Panama, which has been more capitalistic?
*  Hasn't Panama just done much, much better than Nicaragua?
*  And I've been to both countries in the last 10 years.
*  To me, it doesn't seem close.
*  What am I missing?
*  You're missing what actually happened.
*  Nicaragua in the 1980s was the second poorest country in Latin America after Haiti.
*  The Sandinista Revolution in the early 80s began to change that.
*  It began to institute programs which were very much praised by the World Bank,
*  international financial institutions, organizations like Oxfam, which were finally
*  doing something.
*  Nicaragua had been in the hands of the United States since the late 19th century.
*  It was a catastrophe, like with every country in the US.
*  It began to escape from this in the early 80s.
*  Very successful.
*  Well, Ronald Reagan launched a war against Nicaragua.
*  The United States was actually brought to the World Court and condemned for
*  international terrorism, technically unlawful use of force in its war against Nicaragua.
*  Ordered to pay substantial reparations, the Reagan administration and Congress
*  responded by stepping up the war.
*  Well, the war had an effect.
*  Destroyed the programs of development, destroyed the hope, restored Nicaragua back to
*  pretty much US control.
*  It hasn't completely succumbed.
*  It's now dictatorial, maintained some social programs, but it's never been able to carry
*  out the programs that were begun in the early 1980s.
*  Panama's a totally different story.
*  It's a place for US investment, capital investment.
*  Panama Canal is a huge income resource.
*  There's just no comparison between the two.
*  Wouldn't Cuba be better off today, much better off, if it had gone the path of, say, Dominican
*  Republic, inviting a lot of multinational corporations, have free trade zones, special
*  enterprise zones?
*  Dominican Republic's now one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America.
*  So let's take Cuba.
*  Cuba is the oldest issue in US foreign policy.
*  Goes back to the 1820s, when the US intended to try to take Cuba from Spain and turn it
*  into another slave state.
*  Well, John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State, realized that you can't do that now.
*  The British are too powerful.
*  They won't let us do it.
*  So we'll wait until, as he put it, Cuba falls into our hands by the laws of political
*  gravitation.
*  We'll get stronger.
*  Britain will get weaker.
*  Then we can take it over.
*  1898, it happened.
*  Cuba was liberating itself from Spain.
*  US invaded on the pretext of liberating Cuba.
*  In fact, it was for preventing Cuba's liberation from Spain.
*  US turned Cuba into a virtual US colony.
*  Stayed that way.
*  It was a massive corruption, mafia, brutal conditions, horrible conditions for the working
*  for most of the population.
*  1959, Cuba freed itself.
*  Within a few months, US planes from Florida were bombing Cuba.
*  March 1960, a year later, Eisenhower administration formally determined to overthrow the government
*  of Cuba.
*  Kennedy came in, launched an invasion, failed, initiated a major terrorist war against Cuba.
*  But that was a long time ago, right?
*  Cuba's had plenty of time to grow and recover, and it's done terribly.
*  Cuba has been under savage attack for 60 years.
*  It's astonishing that it's even survived.
*  Well, it's survived, barely.
*  It has better health statistics than the United States.
*  It's developed a biomedical system, which is one of the wonders of the world.
*  Despite US sanctions, which are so strict that if Cuba wants something to use for vaccines from
*  Sweden, they can't get it.
*  The United States is a very violent and brutal country.
*  When the United States imposes sanctions, they are third party sanctions.
*  Every country in the world has to accept them.
*  The world is overwhelmingly opposed.
*  Look at the United Nations.
*  The votes are 184 to 2.
*  The United States and Israel, total opposition.
*  Everybody obeys the US sanctions out of fear of the most violent country in the world.
*  The fact that Cuba has even survived is an astonishing thing.
*  If you look at things like health statistics, quality of life, and so on,
*  it's one of the best in the hemisphere, even better than ours.
*  The European Union can trade with Cuba, right?
*  A lot of the health statistics have been revealed to be fraudulent.
*  Latin America can trade with Cuba.
*  You can fly from Mexico to Cuba.
*  The European Union tries to trade with Cuba.
*  The US threatens it with throwing it out of the international financial system.
*  The European Union obeys the US sanctions.
*  Who's the thinker on the left, say, in the last 20 years whom you admire the most?
*  The people I admire most are the young people in the streets who are
*  on the front line of trying to save the world from disaster.
*  There are a lot of very good people, but not up to me to rank them.
*  But as a writer, who is it you learn from, you look forward to their next book,
*  you try to meet with?
*  Well, I found recently that in this day and age, the easiest way to write and reach people
*  is through the internet, because a lot of people don't read books much anymore.
*  So I've been doing regular books of interviews and discussions.
*  Several have come out in the last year, others are in the works, will be out soon.
*  Who's the thinker on the right whom you've admired the most, over say, the last 20 years?
*  That's the same point.
*  There are people, I mean, I read plenty of good work from what's called right to left,
*  but it's the quality of the work that counts, not the person. I don't rank people.
*  A few questions about the Noam Chomsky production function.
*  How have you stayed so mentally vital so late in life?
*  Just the incentive of so much to do, of such enormous significance.
*  I don't see any way to stop both in both of the areas that we've been talking about.
*  I try to maintain and do maintain a lively commitment to intellectual work,
*  a lot of new work there, but the issues of human concern are just overwhelming.
*  We have to face the fact that we are in a unique moment of human history.
*  Nothing like this has ever happened in a couple hundred thousand years that humans have been on
*  Earth. We now have to decide within a couple of decades whether the human experiment
*  is going to continue or whether it'll go down in in glorious disaster. That's what we're facing.
*  We know answers, at least possible answers, to all of the problems that face us.
*  We're not pursuing them. The leadership is going in the opposite direction.
*  How can anybody relax under these circumstances?
*  Do you think it's genetic that you're still going or just essentially voluntarist?
*  Nobody knows a thing about it.
*  But it's you and Henry Kissinger, right? Who would have thought they would be the two of you?
*  Human genetics are a mystery.
*  Why do you answer every email?
*  Because I take people seriously. I think people deserve respect.
*  Two final questions. First, what's the biggest misperception people have about you?
*  Depends what they read. People read
*  Newsweek, for example. They'll have the assumption that I think we should hand Ukraine over to the
*  Russians. Sure, that's the way manufacturers consent works in the ideological journals.
*  If people read what I say, they'll have a different opinion.
*  Final question. What is it that you will do next?
*  Well, the thing I'll do next in 10 minutes is have a long discussion at a
*  major conference in, happens to be in Texas, on social and political issues.
*  Annual conference takes place there. After that, go back to the regular work of
*  the two sides of my brain, social and political issues, intellectual contributions.
*  And in your career, where do you feel it is that you've been most wrong?
*  There are a lot of things that have been wrong. So for example, take the Vietnam War.
*  I was very much involved in it. In fact, it was my whole life for a couple of years.
*  But I got involved much too late. I got seriously involved in the early 60s,
*  when Kennedy sharply escalated the war. It was almost nobody concerned with it at that time.
*  But the time to have gotten involved was 10 years earlier. I didn't know it at the time,
*  you know, now when the government made the basic decisions, early 50s, that set the stage for
*  what became the most hideous crime of the 20th century. That was the time to get involved.
*  Not when I did many other things like that. There's so much that should be done that
*  I haven't managed to do right now. You can say the same thing.
*  The Holocaust isn't the most hideous crime of the 20th century?
*  The late 20th century.
*  A late 20th century. Noam Chomsky, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
