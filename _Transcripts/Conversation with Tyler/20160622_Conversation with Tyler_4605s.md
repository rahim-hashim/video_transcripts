# Cass Sunstein on Judicial Minimalism, the Supreme Court, and Star Wars  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [June 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNX4ywuWqRE)
*  The force is strong with this one. Cass is by far the most widely cited legal scholar
*  of his generation. His older book, Nudge, and his new book on Star Wars are both best
*  sellers. And he was head of OIRA under President Obama from 2009 to 2013. Powerful you have
*  become. So tonight I'd like to start with a survey of Cass's thought. We're going to
*  look at legal theory and then go to Nudge and then consider Star Wars, how it all ties
*  together and then we're going to talk about everything. So let's start with your legal
*  theory. If I think of Richard Epstein, I think of classical liberalism, some mix of rights
*  and utilitarian reasoning. If I think of Dick Posner, I think of pragmatism mixed with
*  law and economics. If I think of Dworkin, it's legal interpretivism. If it's Cass Sunstein,
*  your legal theory in a nutshell, how should I characterize you?
*  Well, I think I'd use three words, incompletely theorized agreements. And I don't think anyone's
*  ever marched under a banner with those three words on it. But in a way, I think that is
*  America's banner. So the idea of incompletely theorized agreements is often we can figure
*  out what our rights are and what to do without committing ourselves to a particular conception
*  of the foundations of morality or without knowing exactly what we think about the foundations
*  of morality. So you can have a free speech principle that says speech is protected unless
*  there's a clear and present danger. Even if you are a welfarist and think that the idea
*  of respect for persons is metaphysical gobbledygook. You can believe in the clear and present danger
*  standard, if you are a Kantian and think that people have a right to say what they wish
*  and go their own path and think that welfarism is a form of barely human robot philosophy.
*  You can be an Aristotelian and say the same thing. You might be just philosophically indifferent
*  and think that if you want to have a society which figures out what's true in some way
*  that is not highfalutin, the clear and present danger test is right. So I could give a zillion
*  examples, I won't, but our freedom of speech principle reflects an incompletely theorized
*  agreement.
*  So in some ways it's like the opposite of Star Wars. Star Wars, it's chock full of metaphysics.
*  And here you're saying we don't really know about metaphysics. How far can we get with
*  only a minimal amount of agreement? And sometimes you've called this judicial minimalism, right?
*  So take like a case going on right now, a very complicated case, North Carolina, transgender
*  individuals, bathrooms, two different points of view. Your perspective of minimalism, is
*  there a way you could apply it to give us the right solution?
*  So I need to say a lot about the particulars of that to resolve it. But to resolve the
*  transgender bathroom issue, we need to think, I think, first about questions, kind of mundane
*  questions about jurisdiction and authority. And I'd like to avoid big questions about
*  sexuality and what people are like, unless you have to get there. And so one question
*  is what authority the states have, what authority does the federal government have? As a presumption,
*  the states have authority over bathroom stuff. On the other hand, the federal government
*  has some regulatory authority under the Civil Rights Act. And if you're falling asleep a
*  little bit, because I'm not talking about transgender in the large, I'm sad you're
*  falling asleep, but a little happy that hair isn't on fire. Because one way democracies
*  work well is they put people's hair on fire very rarely. They try to use issues of democratic
*  process and who has the authority to do what, as a way of allowing us to live together peaceably,
*  not withstanding our disagreements. So there's a good argument, at least, that the federal
*  government has regulatory authority under the civil rights laws to figure out what counts
*  as discrimination, sex discrimination in particular. So whether in the end this is
*  a convincing argument, I'm kind of bracketing that. But that is a minimalist direction.
*  It wouldn't say anything super large about what sex equality means. It would say something
*  more modest about who has authority.
*  So let's take you and Dick Posner as theorists of legal reasoning. He's also not a big proponent
*  of metaphysics, but you and he end up at different points, especially earlier, Dick Posner, right?
*  He's actually moved closer to you. What's the empirical variable that you and Posner
*  disagree about that accounts for where you end up and where he ends up?
*  Okay, well we just have to figure out where exactly we differ. Early on he had a view,
*  and this is not an empirical disagreement, but early on he had a view that wealth maximization
*  is what judges should try to maximize.
*  He's moved away from that.
*  Yeah, and I would say consider that too sectarian of you. So I think his view of judicial authority
*  is a little too free-floating for me. So where we disagree, if we do, I think we probably
*  do, is that I am more concerned about the need for stable rules that discipline judicial
*  authority, even if it would be exercised wisely by some judges. And Judge Posner, I think,
*  is a superb judge whose judgment in particular cases is often excellent, but it doesn't
*  have a kind of rule-following character on some occasions that I think for most judges
*  is a very important safeguard against the willful exercise of discretion.
*  So now let's go to your famous work on nudge with Dick Thaler. And nudge is not direct
*  physical violence. It's nudge, right? Is that just a direct outgrowth of judicial minimalism
*  but applied to regulatory policy that here's what we ought to all be able to agree upon
*  without much in the way of metaphysical commitment so it's all one big picture or not?
*  It's a great question. So I'll give you a kind of yes and a no. The no is when Dick
*  Thaler and I thought about the idea of nudging, the notion was that choice preserving approaches
*  often have two really great features. One is they preserve people's ultimate freedom
*  to go their own way and the other is that it can, a choice preserving approach, can
*  give welfare and longevity and everything good, the benefit of the doubt. So a GPS is
*  a nudge. It tells you the direction in which you probably ought to go if you want to get
*  there expeditiously, the direction you want to go and if you want the scenic route or
*  the route that triggers feelings of nostalgia in you, go for it. Tell that little voice
*  to be quiet. You're going to go your own way. That's a nudge. And what Thaler and I thought
*  informed by behavioral science and behavioral economics is that human beings don't know
*  how to navigate roads unless they are really trained. They might use heuristics for how
*  to get to places. I certainly do that often go wrong. And if you want to manage your savings
*  portfolio you might rely on rules of thumb that are going to make you less wealthy than
*  would be good or you might have eating habits that aren't so good or you might get a mortgage
*  that isn't in your interest. And so given human fallibility nudges are often super important
*  for well-being. They're actually all around us. So a nudge-free world is actually literally
*  unimaginable. So we thought about how can you get to good results while preserving
*  people's freedom which is a great safeguard against private or public error. So that idea
*  doesn't have much of a family resemblance to minimalism. Minimalism is a way of telling
*  the judges be shallow, which is not good in romance, but which is good often for courts.
*  Don't get deep. That might be too sectarian and be narrow, meaning decide this case and
*  not all cases on the ground that width when it comes to a court can be a recipe for self-embarrassment.
*  You decide an affirmative action case in a way that resolves all affirmative action
*  cases. Then you might be confounded by situations where either affirmative action is let's
*  say extremely important or is invidious. So that's minimalism.
*  That does sound like nudge to me. What's the thing you can get people to agree on very
*  context specific? It's not a judge, it's a regulator, but it's like the unity of Cass
*  Sunstein thought. There you're completely right. So what appeals
*  to me about nudging in part is in a sharply divided polity. A nudge can be a very, very
*  solid salute to you, a form of political minimalism where people might say, you know,
*  I don't know what I think about climate change, but if you give me a fuel economy label that
*  tells me something about how much money I'm going to pay this year and tell me by the
*  way something about the polluting content of the car, I'm for that. So nudges often
*  can attract appeal from people who would disagree about bigger stuff.
*  Let me tell you some of my views on nudge and then you respond. So I view everything
*  in life as a nudge. So in this sense, nudge per se doesn't bug me. Some nudges may or
*  may not work. Fine, let's discuss that, but I'm not offended by the nudge. But I see in
*  the world so many people who hate the idea of nudge in a deep sense. And if you view
*  every point as being a nudge of some kind, you'll also think, well, there's no point
*  of pure transparency. We can nudge everyone too. That's the default. But nudging is always
*  a metaphysical commitment of some kind. So I worry there are conflicting impulses in
*  you. There's the, well, let's do this metaphysics for you, like the minimalism. But if everything's
*  a nudge and you're choosing across all of these non-transparent points, there's some
*  deep metaphysical commitment in Cass Sunstein and I want to get at what that commitment
*  is and then tie it into a big theory of why do some people seem to hate this idea so much.
*  Do you see what I'm saying?
*  Yes, I do. So, okay, so the economic analysis of law has had many good ideas. It's had one
*  great idea, like world transforming idea, I think. And the idea is when your stock minimizes
*  the sum of the costs of decisions and the costs of errors. Now, that is not gripping
*  stuff, but it's profoundly true that if you don't know what to do, figure out either a
*  meta rule or a particular decision that make error costs low, meaning the number and the
*  magnitude is small, and that make decision costs low, meaning you don't have to drive
*  yourself crazy. And we intuitively, I think, minimize the sum of error costs and decision
*  costs when we decide how to handle a menu, whether it's for a meal tonight or whether
*  it's for what kind of car to buy when it is kind of an equivalent of a menu. So minimalism,
*  if it is to be defended on the judicial side, the background kind of theory is it helps minimize
*  the costs of decisions, costs of errors. If you decide this affirmative action case and not everyone,
*  then you're not going to be decisionally overwhelming to yourself if you're a court,
*  and more fundamentally, you're not going to produce tremendous errors for the future. And
*  that's a common risk for judicial decisions, whether the question is the power of the president
*  or the right to privacy. You can blunder terribly if you get away from the particulars of the case,
*  and this has something to do with what judges informational inputs are. They're limited. Now,
*  in terms of nudges, they have the same feature. Now, they're not always the right way to go.
*  Sometimes you have an option of not doing a nudge and you shouldn't, and sometimes you have
*  an option of doing a mandate like forbid murder. That's good. But the analysis of nudging, when they
*  make sense, it's that they are decisionally less burdensome to produce and the costs of error are
*  lower because if you screw it up, people can say, you're giving me some information about the
*  caloric content of brownies and hamburgers. Thank you very much, but I like that brownie and the
*  high calorie hamburger. That's my dinner tonight. Instead of nudging people, what if we just pay
*  them to do the right thing? Is that better or worse? It depends on the cost of decisions and
*  cost of errors. So you could, if you want to encourage people to save more, there's first a
*  question whether that's a good idea, but let's stipulate. In Denmark, economic incentives have
*  had significantly less effect in promoting savings than automatic enrollment. There's every reason to
*  believe that in an area that isn't hugely important but isn't trivial, that is paper usage.
*  If you have a double-sided default for printing, an institution will save much more money than if
*  the price of paper is jacked up. So often, a little nudge, changing the default rule, giving
*  people some information will have a very significant effect on behavior, more so than
*  tax incentives or other economic incentives. And that's good, by the way, partly because on the
*  cost side, it's much less. You're not sticking the taxpayers with anything. On the other hand,
*  there are some domains where incentives have a bigger effect. We have evidence that
*  taxes for cigarettes have a big impact in reducing smoking. I think presumptively that's a very good
*  idea. 480,000 Americans die every year. If we can cut that number, that's a good thing. Whereas the
*  warnings we now have on cigarettes seem to be less effective than increasing the incentive not to
*  smoke. Let's take a concrete example from real life. Jedi mind tricks. Obi-Wan comes along and
*  says, these aren't the droids you're looking for. And what does the stormtrooper do? He goes away.
*  Now, is that a nudge? No, it's a form of manipulation. So... Okay, but how do you draw
*  the metaphysical categories? It seems like a nudge that just happens to work all the time.
*  Okay, I'll give you a quick and dirty way of getting at that. Many social scientists make
*  a distinction between system one, which is the intuitive, rapid processing of the brain,
*  which sees maybe a large dog and thinks, oh my gosh, I'm going to get bitten, or feels turbulence
*  in a plane and says we're all going to die. And system two, the more deliberative system,
*  which says rightly upon seeing a large dog, this might be my best friend and the likelihood of
*  being bitten is super low. And if the plane starts shaking, system two in the brain thinks,
*  plane shake and they hardly ever crash. Manipulation, we can say as a first approximation,
*  is when the agent is appealing to system one and not appealing to people's deliberative faculties.
*  When Obi-Wan says, and we have to watch it in very slow motion to see exactly what's happening,
*  but when Obi-Wan says these are not the droids you're looking for, Obi-Wan is not appealing to
*  the deliberative faculties of the stormtrooper. A nudge... Let's say we follow David Hume. How
*  much do people ever deliberate? So when I do things, when I'm driving, I can end up in places. I
*  don't even recall having driven what I choose to eat, how much I eat. It seems 98% of my life
*  isn't deliberated. So does that really shrink the realm of nudge then?
*  No, because a nudge can be a system one nudge or a system two nudge. And whether... Okay, so
*  if it's a system two nudge, it's by definition not a form of manipulation. So if there's a reminder
*  or a warning or a fuel economy label that tells you how much the car is going to cost to operate,
*  then there's no risk of manipulation. If people are given a graphic warning that let's say shows
*  a smoker who has lung cancer, then there's a discussion to be had about whether it's
*  manipulation. I think this is a way into the topic of manipulation. Probably we have to say something
*  like if one person is appealing to another in a way that wholly bypasses deliberative capacities,
*  there's at least a risk of manipulation. It might be justified, all things considered.
*  The nudges that seem to me to be appropriate in a democratic society are either nudges that appeal
*  to people's reflective or deliberative capacities, or that don't exploit or inflame solely people's
*  non-deliberative capacities. If you're doing that, then you owe them some stuff. One of which is
*  publicity is about what you're doing. So I'm for the graphic warnings for cigarettes. That was
*  preceded by a public comment period, completely transparent. There's evidence that when there are
*  graphic warnings for smokers, smokers actually know better, not worse, about the actual risks
*  of smoking. So it gets kind of complicated, but the simple bottom line is Obi-Wan Kenobi is a great
*  hero of the galaxy. Long time ago, far, far away, still a great hero. That moment was an act of
*  manipulation. If you were to pick one character from Star Wars who would nudge you, you get to
*  elect them, you're the only vote, even Samantha doesn't get a vote, just Cass, not your children.
*  Which character would you pick? Whom would you trust with that nudge? The universe full of Jedi
*  here, right? Yoda. Yoda. But I worry about Yoda. I trust him. It seems to me Yoda is always wrong.
*  Here's what someone online wrote about Yoda. Let me just read episode five and six. I quote,
*  basically every single word of advice Yoda offers Luke is dead wrong. In the end, Luke was right and
*  Yoda was wrong. There was still good in Anakin and the death of Palpatine came about because Luke
*  ignored his advice. Yoda was also wrong about what to do at the end of Empire Strikes Back.
*  Episode one, Yoda refuses to believe that Mal was a Sith and he refuses to allow Anakin to become a
*  Padawan until it is confirmed there were Sith about. Then he totally changes his mind and he
*  badly mishandles the crisis on Nabu. Episode two, Yoda not only takes the bait and jumps into the
*  trap of taking the clones to rescue Anakin and Obi-Wan, therefore starting the events leading to
*  the death of all the Jedi and the start of the worst war in millennia, dot dot dot. You sure you
*  want to pick Yoda? Yoda had it all figured out. So it looks like he made a lot of bad decisions but
*  he knew, you know, no pain no gain and it all works out. Hooray Yoda. He doesn't tell Luke who his father is, right?
*  He could have could have said that. So another way to put it is that that's I think you're onto
*  something actually very deep about the movies which is that Yoda is nominally the wise person
*  but he makes a kind of fundamental error which is he thinks that detachment is good and attachment
*  is bad. He's the kind of stoic or Buddhist figure in the movie to which obviously the saga is deeply
*  drawn but the Buddhist and stoic view is defeated in the end. Attachment wins out. That's what brings
*  balance to the force because Anakin can't bear and he's called Anakin by the way in the script
*  in the first time for the first time after he saves Luke by killing the emperor and being on his
*  in his death scene then he's called Anakin again and it's attachment. It's attachment that restores
*  him so Yoda is deeply wrong. I was just thinking about, you know, if the question is financial
*  wisdom or food consumption or exercise I don't want to ask Luke or Leia or Han. If you ask Luke
*  I can't even understand what R2-D2 is saying and C-3PO is just going to get all anxious on me
*  so Yoda's my guy. If you ask Luke you're going to get a weird chaste kiss with your sister, right?
*  And it might be not that chaste and I love my sister and let's change the subject.
*  So let's take a question or two about Star Wars. I take it you've seen these movies. Your book is
*  now number one on the Washington Post bestseller list. It's on other bestseller lists. Every day I
*  see it covered. President Obama is also a Star Wars fan. What can you tell us about the president
*  and Star Wars? Well I can tell you a few things. First I did have an opportunity to talk to him
*  when I was working in the White House about many subjects. Cost benefit analysis, the relationship
*  between regulation and economic recovery, issues involving regulatory reform and small business.
*  And I didn't once talk to him about Star Wars. But very recently post book I did talk to him
*  about Star Wars. He doesn't have a lot of time to talk at length about Star Wars but we did
*  talk about Star Wars. And what I'd say is a couple things. First article two section one of the
*  Constitution protects executive privilege. It's kind of a foundation of the separation of powers
*  and that protects him from disclosure of anything he may or may not have said in private about Star
*  Wars. But I will say that he said publicly something which I'm going to make a little news
*  tonight. You know I worked with him for four years and people who work under the president I think
*  have a obligation not to break with their former boss publicly and I haven't done that. But I
*  will now. The president said that A New Hope was the best of the Star Wars movies. Number four.
*  Number four. And that was a colossal blunder on his part. And the best of course is The Empire
*  Strikes Back. And I do feel that the president has superb judgment and done many excellent things. But
*  I'm kind of getting my mind around the fact that this person, my boss, how could he have made that
*  level of mistake. So he's hope and change and you're a darker vision of history actually.
*  I'm wondering if that's the nature of the disagreement. I think hope and change of the
*  New Hope sort whatever your political affiliation. You know Senator Cruz is a big Star Wars fan.
*  Donald Trump is a Star Wars fan. People who don't like you know President Obama's policies
*  love Star Wars. But I think that The Empire Strikes Back just is a better movie. So if you like dark
*  movies or light movies, The Empire Strikes Back is one of the great movies of all time. It's
*  probably the greatest movie of all time. A New Hope is a superb movie. It's probably the second
*  greatest movie of all time. But The Empire Strikes Back is better. But let me tell you a bit of my
*  views of the prequels and then you respond. I think they're strongly underrated. Lucas was a genius.
*  He broke with his previous mold. They're fundamentally movies about institutions that drop with the idea
*  of following simple personal narratives. And number one especially is the story of how youth
*  grows into seeking power and they're deep and profound and highly original. So from my point
*  of view the worst episode, Seven Aside, which is not even part of the canon, the worst one is number
*  six, Jedi, which is too redemptionist, too many Ewoks, a little too cuddly. It's a very good Disney
*  movie and the most underrated episode is number one. But I take it you have different views. So
*  you tell us how you see the different pieces fitting together. I agree with a lot of what you
*  said but there's one thing you said which is the level of colossal error of the presidents and
*  saying New Hope is the best and that is you said three is the worst of the movies. And that is,
*  forgive me, that's a colossal error not because... Three is the worst? Not because, didn't you say?
*  Six is the worst. Six is the worst. Six and the worst you said. Okay so six is, when you said
*  it's the worst, I'm going to disagree with the idea that it's the least good but
*  the only answer to the question which is the worst of the Star Wars movies is there is no worst Star
*  Wars movies. One might be the least amazing and fantastic but there's none that is the worst of
*  the Star Wars movies. So with that pedantic point, so let's get to the fundamentals. I think you are
*  right in saying the prequels are underrated and we need a movement, you may have just started it,
*  for the revival of the prequels as an object of admiration. And the reason I think they deserve
*  admiration is multiple. One is just your point that they boldly go where, I won't finish the sentence,
*  they boldly don't do, as the standard movie of this kind does, a focus on individuals. There's
*  individual stuff but it's about institutions and they have something to say about both how people
*  go bad and here I think it does get deep, especially about a little boy who loses his mother. And
*  that, and then his loved one who is much older and in some ways a mother figure, that's extremely
*  interesting I think psychologically and he kind of loses her too and it's the threat of loss that
*  gets to him. I think that's super interesting and there's something very similar that happens with
*  the Republic. So the institutional failure of a squabbling legislature leading for interest in a
*  strong paternal leader that's mirrored in the democratic process as it is in the individual
*  life and that's great. Also the visual imagination of Lucas in the prequels I think is unimpaired.
*  Indeed it exceeds the first three in terms of release. They're fantastic. So I think that's
*  completely true. I want to say a word in favor of Return of the Jedi which you're describing as
*  the least fabulous of the six. I would say The Phantom Menace is probably the sixth greatest
*  movie ever made but it's also the sixth best of the movies which is to say the W word.
*  It's the least good of those movies but the Return of the Jedi I think is terrific and
*  the reason it's terrific is the redemption scene is a triumph where what Lucas did in the
*  original trilogy was to borrow on Joseph Campbell's idea of the hero with a thousand faces.
*  Many myths and religions have an arc of a hero and Lucas described Campbell as my Yoda
*  and that was his model but there's a twist here that involves freedom of choice and redemption
*  concretized in the idea of a father whose life course had been dedicated to terrible things
*  repudiating that life course and choosing to save his child because he can't bear that loss.
*  That scene is I think one of surpassing beauty where Vader now called Anakin says,
*  let me see you with my own eyes and Luke says but you'll die, takes the mask off and
*  Luke says I can't leave you, I have to save you father and Anakin says you already have.
*  I think you're more of a sentimentalist than I am. Let me get to what I view as our point of
*  deepest disagreement in all of political philosophy and then you respond to it. If I ask myself
*  what are these movies as a set really about? To me the core message is how hard it is to exercise
*  freedom of the will and that evil is both stronger and more attractive. So the central character is
*  Darth who is mostly evil. There's some redemption at the end but he never sets things right. He just
*  stops there from being further destruction. Even in episode seven there's a terrible amount of
*  murder. Nothing is set right in the galaxy. Episodes one through three which we both admire,
*  they're all the Darth story. Luke just ended up doing voices for children's cartoons.
*  Even Han Solo is a bit of a scoundrel and if you look at Anakin who becomes Darth the evil guy,
*  he gets Natalie Portman. Luke kisses his sister once and is sent to live in some netherworld that
*  looks like New Zealand and then he looks like he has an opioid addiction and that's good. So to me
*  it's all about the potency of evil and that's why Lucas picked the Leni Riefenstahl scenes for episode
*  four when there's the triumphant rebels coming at the end. It's taken from Nazi cinema right? We all
*  know that. So I have this deep and dark view of them and then it's not surprising I would find
*  Return of the Jedi number six to be the weakest and really admire episode one. Now you totally
*  disagree with that and consider that to be absurd so tell us what you think. I don't consider it
*  absurd. So I think one of the you know sources of awesomeness in these cartoon-like and probably
*  awesome movies is that an interpretation like the one that you offered is eminently plausible
*  and there's material there that justifies it and let me say a little bit in favor of your interpretation
*  and then say why in the end it's not mine. So William Blake said of the greatest religious poem
*  I think in the English language Paradise Lost said of John Milton roughly this he said the reason
*  Milton wrote in feathers in speaking of God in heaven and at liberty when speaking of the
*  devil in hell is that he was a true poet and of the devil's party without knowing it.
*  Now that's a wow sentence. It's about Blake's I don't think this was Blake's considered view
*  but Blake's flirtation let's say with the view that Satan runs away with Paradise Lost because
*  a true poet is more Dionysian than Apollonian and the kind of wild system one eroticism or something
*  of Darth Vader or Satan is ultimately what sublimely powerful something like that. That's
*  in your interpretation of the movies. I don't see it that way and I think George Lucas kind of got
*  a little bit at why I don't see it that way. He said in one interview long after the original
*  trilogy I think long after the prequels too he said every one of us has a choice of being a hero
*  every single day of our lives. We can treat somebody with dignity and kindness
*  or not. We can be a decent person on that day or not and I think that kind of somewhat innocent
*  and earnest thinking that you are at a crossroads you can go one way rather than the other
*  is basically the authorial voice behind Star Wars. So it may be that you're turned off and I don't
*  love the Ewoks so much and you know the way they're a little too cutesy. I agree with that but the idea
*  that Luke and okay so I think this is one of the most powerful lines in let's say popular culture
*  in American history. I am a Jedi like my father before me. That's extraordinary and what's
*  extraordinary about that is he is the statement is my father the worst person in the universe
*  is a Jedi and that is claiming the goodness and non-sithness of the father. Ultimately Luke makes
*  it true that the Jedi-ness of Vader is redeemed in the end and that's where I think the movies in
*  the end come down but they do go to the dark side so that's why I think what you say has plausibility.
*  They don't in the end honor it. Have episodes one through three made you more libertarian?
*  I'd say writing the book has made me more libertarian.
*  And how so?
*  Not in a way that's fundamentally different from how I've been so Nudge the title for Nudge we
*  were committed to calling it Libertarian Paternalism. I don't think anyone would have bought that book
*  but it shows that it's...
*  Two unpopular words put together somehow still remain unpopular.
*  But the idea that unless you're really confident you should let people go their own way whoever
*  you are I think that's part of American culture and that's an essential part of American culture.
*  But what writing the book has made me focus on maybe more is the deep truth to the fact
*  that each of us all the time faces a crossroads and either for welfarist reasons or for reasons
*  of respect for dignity and these are you know we can have an incompletely theorized agreement
*  whichever one is our foundation to let people choose their own path is that's the right idea.
*  Now that's not different from what I thought before but it's kind of focuses it a little more
*  what is it a little puts it a little more the the font size of those sentences a little larger in
*  my head than before.
*  One thing I find striking in the dark reading of Star Wars is that it introduces the notion that maybe slavery
*  is almost bound to be a constant throughout history. If you look at the portrait of droids
*  how they're treated it's quite grim and they may be sentient to varying degrees.
*  There's slavery throughout the empire it feels quite natural we're not in any way supposed to approve
*  but it forces us to reface the question if there's been slavery throughout most of human history
*  and we're seeing this alternative world where slavery re-emerges and in an ugly horrible way
*  feels quite natural. Does that tell you more on this dark vision of history and therefore
*  confirming your favoritism for episode five or are you back with this president guy and the you know
*  the hope and change stuff?
*  I think the arc of history is long and it bends toward justice and I think that's what the Star Wars
*  message is. The dark side is in the human heart and chaos is very troubling
*  for an individual or for a culture which can lead you to authoritarian leaders
*  but the arc of history is on the right side I believe that.
*  And should Luke have completed his training in the Dagobah system? Take that as the central
*  moral dilemma of episode five. No he made the right choice. So the nudgers were wrong. Well one
*  nudger Obi-Wan and Yoda right you're telling him you can't complete your training and he's like
*  later Ben why didn't you tell me? So thank God for libertarian paternalism that Luke has a choice.
*  So that's the Sith by the way like the Jedi respect freedom of choice so in the
*  in the crucial scene in episode three where the question is whether Anakin is going to save
*  the person who would be emperor he says you must choose and so there's full respect for freedom of
*  choice. Nudgers have that. The bad guys always tell you the deal and then they say choose evil
*  it seems the good guys always mislead you. Well this is funny tension Star Wars makes me more nervous
*  about nudge. I'm not like this huge anti-nudge guy but when I look at Obi-Wan and Yoda lying to Luke
*  Ben Ben Ben why didn't you tell me? How many times have I heard that in these movies? Well okay so
*  advertisement for that? I think it's it's fair to ask whether Obi-Wan and Yoda had it right. Sure. Okay
*  so one view is that they kind of completely knew what they were doing. They're like strowsies. They had
*  second order stuff going on and you know superficial people like you and me. We need to get in back of
*  it to see the deep logic and it all worked out and they knew it. But on nudging the the point is if
*  there's a website it's going to nudge. If there's a cafeteria it's going to nudge. If there's a rental
*  car office it's going to nudge. Everything but a Sith. So well Sith nudges too it's just a Sith doesn't
*  on this in this respect a Sith doesn't coerce. It's a little like Dr. Faust that your soul you
*  get to decide whether your soul is saved. The Sith agree with that. So on nudging in general the fact
*  that we can find bad nudgers which is very true attest to the importance of having either free
*  markets which discipline bad nudging. So we have choice architecture you know much more often than
*  not in a market society which is in consumers interests and having democratic controls on
*  government nudging such that if the people hate it or the government's going in a direction that
*  doesn't make much sense the democratic safeguard will kick in. Now we have a section in all of these
*  chats it's called overrated or underrated. I toss out some items people whatever you're free to pass
*  on any of these if it's not appropriate. Number one overrated or underrated the United States
*  Constitution. Underrated. Underrated tell us why. Well it's been the foundation for probably the
*  greatest experiment in democratic self-government in the history of the world and there's
*  grave difficulty in overrating something that's done something like that. So whether the constitution
*  is you know a set of specific prescriptions or whether instead it's a framework for
*  a society which has changed radically from 200 years there's disagreement about that but whatever
*  it is underrated. If the Supreme Court had to be only three people or 50 people which of those
*  numbers would you prefer? 50. You seem to like eight right because minimalism. 50. 50. More
*  diffusion of power. Yeah with three there's too great a risk that it's going to go off half cocked.
*  The original television show Star Trek overrated or underrated. Underrated great. And what's the
*  difference in think of Star Trek and Star Wars they're alternate growth models right.
*  What's the key economic variable or political variable that differs to get you one result
*  rather than the other? Meaning to go and. Is it replicators by lithium crystals. Oh the economic
*  variable. Who nudges whom. Like why do you get these two parallel worlds. What's the comparative
*  statics? I think the answer is that there's a technological something that Star Wars captures
*  and there's nothing quite like that that Star Wars gets at. So whether it's a little I think
*  it's a little thing it's so small you can't even see it we of course haven't discovered it yet
*  that produces replicators and ships like that. That's what they got and in Star Wars they didn't
*  and so the universe looks fundamentally different. The only reason I'm hesitating a little bit here
*  is the Millennium Falcon was able to do the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs and no way the
*  Enterprise gets there. In the 27 parsecs probably maybe more and so there is a technological
*  advantage. I'm struggling with this question. Here's an easy one that James Joyce overrated
*  or underrated. Now they're watching back home. Irish family. So I think underrated that Ulysses is
*  arguably the richest novel in the last 150 years. Not the greatest but the richest.
*  Richest in what sense? It's just full of multiple interpretations that aren't an interpolation of
*  a smart reader but are actually there in the materials. So there's stuff from Irish history,
*  stuff from the Bible, stuff about men and women that are you know extremely surprising and variable
*  from one chapter to another. Now I'm going to read forth a quotation. It's actually a
*  theory of regulatory reform. You've worked in this area. You tell me if it's underrated or overrated.
*  This is from Master Yoda and I quote, try not, do or do not. There is no try. The regulatory reform.
*  Overrated or underrated? Overrated. Tell us why. You gotta try. I mean if it's deregulation or
*  economic incentives or information strategies, try and test. So not do. Well you can't just sit
*  there and try and stare at your federal register notice. You have to, you know, if the question is
*  do you deregulate the airwaves in some respects or deregulate transportation, you do but there has
*  to be an experimental attitude which Yoda's words aren't capturing. But Yoda got the airlines right.
*  Well it seemed to work out in the sense that we didn't see a lot of inadvertent crashes
*  by the Jedi. But you wouldn't do a Yoda for workplace safety is what you're saying.
*  I think they try. What I'm picking up on in Yoda's, I mean you could read it in a way such that it's
*  compatible with what I'm saying, but it seems to have, okay so there's work, in fact I've
*  co-authored an article on this on action bias which says when you're stuck in a tough situation,
*  either an institution or an individual, do something. Don't just stand there, do something.
*  But that's often a mistake. You might want to strike when the iron is cold. Wait. Have a chance
*  to think. So I think Yoda, maybe that's a headline to a more convincing account than
*  Yoda was able to give in the confines of the movie. He's the guy you chose to nudge you.
*  Yeah, well the question is my investment portfolio or my diet or my exercise regimen. But not your
*  regulatory reform. Well I think I have more experience with regulatory reform than Master
*  Yoda. Forgive me Master, but on that issue, not deferring to you Master Yoda. So he's a master,
*  you're a grandmaster. No, no, he's a master who has a few pockets of limited experience.
*  What's the most underrated Bob Dylan album? That's a great question.
*  I'm going to say the freewheel in Bob Dylan. And it's a bit of a risky choice because people
*  don't think it's bad. It's in the top seven probably and some people would put it in the five,
*  the top five. It has a terrible title. The freewheel in Bob Dylan? Sure. And the freewheel
*  in anyone, that would be a terrible title. There's no one, the freewheel in Han Solo,
*  that's awful. There's no one for whom that's a good title. Bob Dylan, whatever he is, he's not
*  freewheelin'. He's you know complicated or mischievous or something or troubled. But the
*  title is wrong foots you. But I think that's his greatest album actually and so it's underrated.
*  How did your time in government change your view of academia?
*  I concluded that academics, including people like me, were in important respects clueless.
*  And I did not think that before. I did feel as admiring or even more admiring of basic research
*  by academics that produces knowledge or fresh ideas that can be put to use. But having studied
*  administrative law for more than two decades, I was amazed by how steep my own learning curve was
*  in an area that I thought I knew well. So I had written about, and I don't mean to single myself
*  out for a program here, I like many administrative law professors write about stuff and just the
*  absence of a sufficiently thick understanding of how things happen. That really surprised me.
*  On the other hand, so that's the not so good side of academia I think, when it works about
*  actual practical things, it's often insufficiently informed. But if anything, as I say, the idea that
*  you can go on the National Bureau of Economic Research website, as I did in government and do
*  now, and find out stuff about what programs are working and whatnot in a way that has a kind of
*  rigor that outruns anything that you could find in the newspaper or generate in a conversation
*  in government. So that I felt, I almost feel like it has a purity, almost like a religious purity,
*  some of the work that academics do. And that's one of the things I was, I had a glow, everyone
*  leaves the White House I think has a glow when they leave. Part of my glow, and this is probably
*  unique, was that I was getting a little more sleep, but also that I got to go back to that stuff,
*  maybe do some empirical work and figure out something that might be true and wasn't known yet.
*  What was Gary Becker's biggest mistake?
*  His biggest mistake was his greatest virtue, which was an unfailing commitment to the rationality
*  assumption. So I love Gary Becker as a person and as a scholar, he's in the pantheon, but his
*  insistence on human rationality was both what made him as fantastic as he was, but also let him
*  astray. So I'll give you a term for it. It's actually recently invented by Matthew Rabin,
*  behavioral economist. The term is explain-awaitions. And the term means, suppose you have
*  a situation where people, let's say, value a coffee mug that they've been given more than a
*  coffee mug that their neighbor has been given. That's an anomaly, that there's an immediate
*  increase in value once you get the thing. And explain-awaition might say something like,
*  well, there's transaction costs in trading, which is desperate. It's an explain-awaition.
*  It's not an explanation. And Gary Becker was, both in his writing and even more in person,
*  a master of the explain-awaition, where he'd come up with some account which had surface credibility
*  so he could say it, but nah. You've written a lot of different books. That's your view of Becker.
*  My guess is there's some unity to those books. What do you yourself see as the semi-hidden
*  metaphysical assumption behind all or most of them that most readers don't see, but if you sit down
*  and think real hard about it, I don't mean that you're trying to hide it from people, but it's
*  hidden in the sense that only after writing them all have you seen that it's there. And what is
*  that assumption? I'd say that it's a form of consequentialism that is very much focused on
*  how will one or another thing make human lives better? So there's some work on political science
*  and law on legitimacy, as if that's a master value. And my work doesn't focus so much on
*  legitimacy. Maybe that's a mistake. But if you look at things on behavioral economics or about
*  nudging or about freedom of speech or about the problems with echo chambers in the internet world
*  or minimalism, it's what regulation certainly, it's what will make people's lives better.
*  And this may seem kind of sentimental, but I hope it isn't. If you're thinking about a highway
*  safety regulation, this was my view in government, my view now, to think about, you know, what does
*  some subcommittee of Congress think or what's the left going to think or what's the right going to
*  think or even something about some abstraction is probably not as good as thinking what are the
*  actual human consequences of doing that? Are you going to save one life or 80? Are you going to
*  adversely affect little businesses which are trying to grow or not? And this is relative to
*  individual preferences. Well, I would not be preference fixated. I think preferences are
*  a very good clue to what is going to promote people's welfare. But what adjudicates preferences
*  versus the other stuff you want to count? Well, I'll say at this point, related to our discussion
*  of incompletely theorized agreements, John Rawls had a footnote in a book that he never published
*  the footnote, which said, we post a signpost, no deep thinking here, things are bad enough already.
*  I love that. So I want to be very clear on the particulars. So if people have a preference,
*  let's say, for something that clearly truncates their life significantly, like they want to
*  drive super fast, let's just stipulate in a way that's not going to endanger others,
*  it's just on a track. That's their preference. To deem that sovereign is not clearly correct.
*  It might be that they're making their lives shorter in a way which on reflection,
*  by their own reflective lights is not a good idea. And that's a pretty stark example. But with respect
*  to smoking, I mentioned the 480,000 deaths per year example. I think that's a number, but each
*  one of those people as a human being, probably everyone who's listening to this, knows at least
*  one, I know two who died of lung cancer. And the preference for smoking, that's not
*  something that we want to be careless about. Now, I wouldn't want to forbid smoking, that would be
*  too coercive. But some efforts to educate and nudge to try to help people not die, that's okay.
*  But like in most pluralist theories, I tend to think there's an underlying metaphysical assumption
*  used to perform aggregation. So banning smoking is too coercive. It's not obvious to me why that
*  is correct. I mean, most people feel that way, but we ban plenty of other drugs and that's not too
*  coercive. There's some mix of costs and benefits, there's a lot of things people eat which are bad
*  for them, we don't do much about that. And in the scale of preferences, autonomy, well-being,
*  liberty. Again, what's the final principle ruling these trade-offs? That's like the hidden
*  metaphysical assumption of Kyle Sunstein that I want to get at. Okay, great. So I think you're
*  completely right that the claim that it's too coercive to ban smoking, that's a conclusion
*  in search of an argument. And the shorthand is that the welfare consequences, all things considered,
*  of a ban would be negative. But that would have to be earned rather than just asserted. That's
*  my view, but I haven't given you data to support it. So what I'd like to do at every difficult point
*  is to be able to say that whatever your metaphysical assumptions, you will be able to
*  go in a certain direction that will be compatible with, let's call it, non-sectarian
*  welfareism. Now if you push me to a content, to talk about liberty, that liberty is an ingredient
*  in welfare, meaning being able to go the direction that you want is welfare promoting for the people
*  who are exercising their freedom. That's one point. And the other point is the million point, that there
*  multiple contexts at least, let's say, we don't want to make a theology of this, but as I think
*  Mill sometimes almost did, but we want to acknowledge that people know, by and large,
*  and acknowledging the behavioral biases better than third parties, what will make their lives go
*  better. So to see liberty as an ingredient in welfare because of its exercise and to see it as
*  a heuristic for what's actually going to promote welfare, those are both good ideas.
*  Let me tell you what I love about Nudge and see if I can pull you into greater love of Nudge.
*  Even greater.
*  Even greater. Take the products today which governments banned, put aside nuclear weapons and
*  violent products. We should unban them and as my colleague Robin Hanson suggests,
*  put them all in a store called the Banned Product Store. And the government will spend a lot on big
*  signs. These are bad for you, don't buy them. There'll be all kinds of negative advertising,
*  but the store will be there. So we're going to nudge people a lot not to buy these products,
*  but in fact we could move from current bans and mandates to having them available but lots more
*  nudges. So I want maybe more nudges than you do or is that not true? Are you the nudge critic?
*  No, no, you may be right, but we have to think of what the thing is.
*  Everything banned that's not violent.
*  Heroin, cocaine.
*  Well, I worry with respect to heroin, not being an expert on heroin, but I worry that it is
*  nearly instantaneously addictive and extremely tempting to a wide range of people in different
*  life circumstances. To be a heroin addict is really, really rough. So to nudge people and not
*  to take the step we've now taken might leave a lot of tragedy around. Now it is true that the
*  heroin ban does not eliminate heroin and it has ancillary consequences that aren't good. But I
*  would say with respect to some product, let's say it's a food where there's a one over X of death
*  from consuming it and X is not that high a number to say to people, you know, you can have this,
*  note that your death risk is one over X. Why is it so great to shift from banning the thing
*  to allowing people to have it when you're going to see a lot of bodies on the streets?
*  Say I'm dying of a terminal disease and there's a treatment, it probably won't help me, but there's
*  a one tenth of one percent chance that it will. And I want to use it as kind of a self-defense
*  argument. And I say, well, self-defense, that's like a minimal value we all would agree upon.
*  I love nudge. Let's take the FDA out of the picture and just put it in the band product store
*  and have big, huge signs, bad music surrounding it, disco, whatever we need to do, telling that
*  it's not any good, but let me buy it. So I want more nudge than you do.
*  You might, but I'm open to these ideas. So in a case where someone has a terminal illness
*  and there's a drug that has an extremely low probability of working, there's a good argument
*  that on welfare grounds they should get that because the chance of death without that,
*  let's stipulate, is 100 percent. And the chance of despair without that is also 100 percent.
*  So if people's tastes are such that they want to spend their money on a very small risk of living,
*  it's plausible to say that's in the store, your store.
*  Yes. Now you're intrigued by the John Stuart, Neil Harriet, Taylor correspondence,
*  and also by Bayett's novel, Possession, from the early 90s. I think you once said it was your
*  favorite novel. What is it that ties those two together and what explains your fascination with
*  them? Okay, so Possession. What does it say about you? Maybe I'm a romantic. So
*  sentimental. They're both letters. There's something dialogical about them.
*  Okay, I'll tell you, for those who don't know Possession, go read it tomorrow. I think it's
*  my personal favorite novel in any language. I can't say it's as rich as Ulysses, but I like
*  it even better. And in terms of greatness, I would rank it with Joyce. So what makes it,
*  I think, so fantastic and what gets to me about it is, and you're correct, the letter exchange
*  between the two lovers. And I think, for one thing, their alertness to the particulars of their own
*  hearts and the particulars of the lover's hearts. So the ability in each of them to be
*  kind of fundamentally in touch with what they themselves are most deeply about and what the
*  person they love is most deeply about, that is, in those letters, I think, overwhelming. And what
*  Byatt gets at, and I think this is what gets to me about it, probably none of us has the literary
*  quality of the two protagonists in Possession. But every one of us has that inside ourselves.
*  And we just see surfaces. Even of our friends, we just see surfaces. But there's stuff going on in
*  them about, you know, it can be needs or fears or loves that are just inaccessible. But there's an
*  inside to everybody that has what Byatt gets in the protagonist. So I think that's completely
*  phenomenal. Now, with Mill and Taylor, I wasn't particularly interested in Mill and Taylor. I
*  was interested in Mill as one of the great thinkers and Taylor as a very important figure
*  and maybe a great thinker. But I wasn't interested in their relationship until I saw that the
*  University of Chicago Press was issuing in its great Hayek series, Hayek on Mill. And that seemed
*  to me intriguing beyond belief. What would Hayek write about Mill? Two of the great liberal thinkers
*  who are very different. But Hayek on Mill is not really Hayek on Mill. It's Hayek's edited edition
*  of the Mill-Taylor correspondence, essentially. And Mill and Taylor had a correspondence,
*  one to the other, much of which I think is destroyed, that has some of the delicacy and
*  I'm struggling for the right words here. What is it? The seeing the particularity of persons,
*  the preciousness of persons and lives. Mill and Taylor both do that. And some of those sentences,
*  one to the other, they're very, I think they're not quite as great as Byatt's protagonists,
*  but they're really something. And when Taylor says something about how she felt when Mill left
*  one day, and we don't even say that to each other, to people we love, to our spouses maybe,
*  sometimes we don't say it, but we feel it. And so Hayek, who seems both one of the great figures
*  in liberal thought, but also a cold fish, I think he seemed like a cold fish. So he's kind of
*  as I respond to your question, he kind of had all that stuff in him clearly. Why would he have gotten
*  into the Mill-Taylor correspondence? This guy who writes about the uses of knowledge and society and
*  the rule of law, which is, that's great stuff, but it's not about how it was when you left that day.
*  But he completely got into that. So I like that too. Last question, and before Q&A, this is in a
*  way about nudges, but even in the last two years, you've published quite a few books.
*  I've lost track myself. And normally when we have someone in for one of these chats, we pile up all
*  of the papers they've written, but today we're in Washington, D.C. There are height restrictions
*  on the buildings. So in lieu of those papers, we have Yoda, Darth, and an Imperial Walker. Those
*  legs were not properly regulated. That's why they fell over so easily. So you've done all this. It's
*  obvious from reading your book, you spend a lot of time with your children. Time management, how do
*  you do it and what's your advice? How do you nudge yourself? Or who nudges you? Well, I have a
*  four-year-old daughter and she just turned four. And if I don't deliver pages to her at night,
*  she goes to bed around 830. She's really mad. She said, Daddy, what did you write? And this is
*  completely false. I'm making it up. But she doesn't have any need that I write pages. But I feel, I
*  guess I feel every day that if I haven't written at least something or had an idea, then I haven't
*  quite done my job. Most days I feel that, to write something. And if I have a week or two weeks where
*  I haven't made a little progress on something that is potentially an academic article or a book,
*  I feel pedal to the metal time. You've got to produce something. So I have kind of an internal
*  superego or something about writing. I also really enjoy it. I have no writer's block,
*  but I will write a lot of stuff that no one will ever see because it's too terrible.
*  So we only get the tip of the iceberg. My filter is probably not sufficiently rigorous,
*  so you probably see too much. But I do have a filter. There's a lot of stuff that I... So I write,
*  I try. There is no try. There's do. But there's also experimenting. So I'm working on a book
*  on liberty. I've been doing it for a few years and I have 90,000 words and I don't like what's there.
*  I hope something will come of it. But just the advice would be, you are a living practitioner
*  of this, is if you have something to say, write it. And then think, is it worth showing to the
*  world? To be too critical of your own production, I think is a, at the early stages at least,
*  is an error. Be critical if it's a book or an academic article. Be really hard on yourself late.
*  But early, just assume it's good. Before we do Q&A, let's have a big round of applause for Seth.
*  On this side, Brian. On the surface, it seems like Star Wars is a highly militaristic story where
*  you have fighting resolving every important situation. But if you really think about the
*  arc of the six stories, it seems like the war was totally futile. If the Jedi had simply surrendered
*  in episode one, things would have actually turned out to be better. At least a whole lot of bodies
*  would have been spared. And striking, if you take a look at the end of episode six in the digitally
*  altered version, Coruscant still looks awesome. So when they have the fireworks going over Coruscant,
*  it does not seem like the emperor's rule actually did any harm except insofar as resisting it caused
*  problems. So what do you think? Is Star Wars actually as militaristic as it is on the surface,
*  or is it a Straussian tale of pacifism as it should be? Okay, so I think that's part of what makes
*  the Star Wars saga work, that these are legitimate questions. My own view is that the best analogy to
*  Star Wars is the American Revolution or the fall of communism, meaning there's an authoritarian
*  regime whose horribleness you don't see constantly on screen, but you get glimpses of it.
*  And the idea of restoring peace and justice to the galaxy, that's completely sincere.
*  And while it wouldn't be that dramatically pleasing to see horror from the authoritarian regime thrown
*  in your face all the time, nor would it be that dramatically pleasing to see a completely easy
*  victory by the forces of peace and justice. The rebel heart of Star Wars is Republican.
*  But Yoda's wrong about everything else this time, I'm sure.
*  Master Yoda isn't wrong about everything else. He made some mistakes, but Yoda is,
*  he's Yoda for a reason, meaning he's really good. Next question.
*  One of Lord Acton's lesser-known aphorisms is that great men are almost always bad men. Jedi
*  are generally always great men or women. With that in mind, if Luke really cared about the galaxy,
*  do you think he should have let himself be the last of the Jedi and gone into self-exile at the
*  end of episode six? What I think Cho and Lai said about the French Revolution is true here.
*  It's too soon to tell. So I don't have a view on the French Revolution, I should add, and I'm
*  against communism, I should add. But whether Luke made a mistake or not in going into exile,
*  as he evidently did, we need to know more. So stay tuned.
*  He went into exile after training people. My assumption would be that he didn't train people
*  anymore. Well, we will see. We will see. Okay, John Dewey said about America,
*  be the evils as they may, the experiment is not played out. The United States are not an established
*  fact to be categorically assessed. So true of Star Wars. Next question. Hi, I'm Ash Nwabwe from
*  student at George Mason University. You've talked about libertarian paternalism, you've talked about
*  F. A. Hayek. Hayek, though, famously wrote in his wrote to Serfdom that the worst rise to the top.
*  So given the current institutional environment we're in, what is your confidence level that
*  libertarian paternalism won't become authoritarian paternalism?
*  Hi. So Hayek was a great man. The idea, I want to look at the passage about the worst rising to the
*  top to see what exactly is being said here. But I work very closely in the federal government with
*  people in the Department of Transportation who are both the political appointees, but more
*  importantly for present purposes the kind of very high level civil servants. And believe me,
*  they're not the worst. They're tremendous. And so America has in its governance,
*  non, I happen to have coffee today with a person, I have no idea what his political party is. He's
*  someone who works at the Office of Management and Budget. I worked with him in the government.
*  He's fantastic. The guy has superb judgment. He knows economics. He knows law. So this worst rise
*  to the top, I think that's, I wish Hayek hadn't said that. A lot of the worst are in jail.
*  Worst aren't typically at the top. Sometimes they are.
*  Next question.
*  So occupational licensing has exploded in recent years. This is a problem that's been acknowledged
*  by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. And it's a problem that you have written about
*  extensively in your own work, the regulatory burdens that everybody who seeks to earn a
*  living in anything from animal massage to giving tour guides to African hair braiders.
*  You have written about the Constitution's commitment to the idea that values should be
*  public values. They shouldn't be self-serving. And you've written about the Constitution as
*  a prohibition against naked preferences. At the same time, you're a judicial minimalist.
*  And the Supreme Court has for decades in the context of evaluating economic rights been
*  committed to something called the rational basis test, which is very, very minimal. At the Supreme
*  Court, the idea that protectionism that serves only the benefits of licensed practitioners
*  is something that would seem to contradict the notion of a public value. So I'm interested in
*  your idea of how judges should approach cases like this and evaluate these kinds of restrictions on
*  people's right to earn a living. We have three minutes total, so give a semi-short answer,
*  then we'll take one more question. I know there's a lot in there. So I would favor
*  release order, not episode order. Is that what you, in terms of viewing the Star Wars movies?
*  Okay, so the short answer to the legal question is, I do think our constitutional framework
*  rightly understood requires a public regarding justification for all legislative acts. I also
*  think that the judicial role with respect to ordinary legislation is appropriately modest,
*  which is to say that for judges to be overseeing whatever comes out of, let's say, the New York or
*  California legislatures to see whether on the judge's view, it's public regarding rather than
*  whether with deference to the knowledge and accountability of the political process,
*  it's public regarding, that would be a mistake. So ramped up rational basis review of the sort that
*  honorable people urge to get rid of what I would agree are objectionable things would produce
*  an excessively aggressive role for federal and state judges in a back to Star Wars Republic.
*  Last question.
*  Hi, so you've talked a lot tonight about making distinctions between when it is appropriate to
*  nudge and when it is appropriate to say ban things. Who makes those decisions and when,
*  who decides when those decisions need to be made?
*  Okay, simple. Okay, I think you intend that question to be rhetorical, meaning as an objection to the
*  whole enterprise, but I hope on reflection, it's actually a good substantive question that does
*  have a pretty easy answer, which is our elected representatives subject to the democratic and
*  constitutional safeguards that they face. So if you have, let's say a libertarian president who
*  wants no, that wasn't meant to be funny. If you have a libertarian president who, let's say,
*  is generally against bans, is okay with nudging, but doesn't want a whole lot of that, then that
*  is what we the people want. And, you know, there we go. If we have a president who, let's say, is
*  pretty bullish on bans as in accordance with Tyler's points, maybe about, well, I guess he wasn't there,
*  but as some people are, not me, not Tyler. So more upbeat about bans than their constitutional
*  and legal restrictions on that. And the reason I'm saying that that's the inevitable answer,
*  our elected representatives, there's no other option. So if you intend your question,
*  forgive me if I'm wrong, as I think I detected as a kind of objection to the whole enterprise,
*  I think what you're saying is you want something like strong constitutional safeguards against
*  any of this stuff. And that's a reasonable view, but that would have to come from we the people also.
*  Over the summer, we will have podcast only episodes of conversations with Tyler.
*  We'll have some fantastic guests to be announced. The next live in-person event is Steven Pinker,
*  October 24th, Arlington campus. But most of all, big round of applause.
