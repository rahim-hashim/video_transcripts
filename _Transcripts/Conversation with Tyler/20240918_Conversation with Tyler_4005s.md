Video Description: Tobi Lütke is the CEO and co-founder of Shopify. 20 years ago, he was just a German coder who emigrated to Canada to launch some ecommerce platform with another German. Now he’s the world-renowned thought and tech leader who has revolutionized online shopping for billions. He’s also the creator of many open-source libraries like Liquid, Active Merchant, and the Typo weblog engine. 

Tyler and Tobi hop from Germany to Canada to America to discuss a range of topics like how outsiders make good coders, learning in meetings by saying wrong things, having one-on-ones with your kids, the positives of venting, German craftsmanship vs. American agility, why German schooling made him miserable, why there aren’t more German tech giants, untranslatable words, the dividing line of between Northern and Southern Germany, why other countries shouldn’t compare themselves to the US, Canada’s lack of exports and brands, ice skating to work in Ottawa, how VR and AI will change retailing, why he expects to be “terribly embarrassed” when looking back at companies in the 2020s, why The Lean Startup is bad for retailers, how fantasy novels teach business principles, what he's learning next, and more.

# Tobi Lütke on Creating Shopify for Americans as a German in Canada | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=0.0s)]
*  Today I'm chatty with Toby Lutke, who is the co-founder and CEO of Shopify, the famous [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=8.2s)]
*  Canadian e-commerce firm. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=13.92s)]
*  Toby, welcome. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=15.92s)]
*  So good to be here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=17.76s)]
*  So good to see you, Tyler. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=18.76s)]
*  I have so many questions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=19.84s)]
*  Do you still do stand-up meetings? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=21.6s)]
*  Whenever we have hack days, I do them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=24.759999999999998s)]
*  I feel they need to make a comeback. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=28.16s)]
*  The Friday afternoon stand-up meeting is just one of the greatest accelerants for businesses. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  I'm highly encouraging everyone to do them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=38.4s)]
*  But digital version doesn't look so well, does it? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=40.56s)]
*  Like it's some Slack bot or so telling everyone to stand up and type something. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=42.44s)]
*  It just doesn't do the same thing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=46.92s)]
*  And it may be harder to monitor. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=48.8s)]
*  What other systems do you have for getting good information out of meetings? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=52.08s)]
*  Out of meetings? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=58.32s)]
*  So I grew up as an outsider. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=59.32s)]
*  I kind of have an outsider mindset, which is kind of hard to argue from first principle [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=65.92s)]
*  to this point. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=71.16s)]
*  But in a small town that was super not interested in computing in Germany. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=72.16s)]
*  And so I learned all sorts of skills for observing people doing interesting things from afar. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=80.36s)]
*  My lifeline back in those days was getting a copy of the back archives of the Linux kernel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=90.24s)]
*  mailing list and so on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  This is how I learned C program. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  So I grew up as an observer on information. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=101.16s)]
*  That's what I do just for fun a lot. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  And also that means I grew up on the internet, which is good and bad. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=108.12s)]
*  So one of my ways to get a lot of out of meetings often involves saying high conviction, incorrect [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=115.28s)]
*  things and just waiting to figure out like seeing everyone wanting to correct me. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=123.12s)]
*  It's a more efficient way of... [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=127.2s)]
*  So it's like Twitter. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=128.84s)]
*  Basically, you want to learn something. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=130.84s)]
*  Stay something wrong on the internet. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, books in real life too. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=134.28s)]
*  It's not people's favorite thing I do, but we have a wiki inside and there's a blueprint [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=136.68s)]
*  for me and it says that I do this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  So some people have reasonable warning these days. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  The systems for making meetings better. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=148.52s)]
*  Should we also use them in our social lives? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=150.68s)]
*  Family dinners? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=154.4s)]
*  You get together with friends? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=156.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=157.52s)]
*  I think porting what makes companies work too far into private lives can also backfire. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=160.12s)]
*  Although I did... [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=166.36s)]
*  With my kids, I always booked one at once. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=168.24s)]
*  So they call them dinner appointments and I tell them, I'm going to treat you as an [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  adult and you're going to have an adult conversation until you say you're a kid again and I'm going [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  to answer every one of your questions to the best of my abilities and they choose some [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=182.68s)]
*  restaurant and we go there and that's what we've done for a while. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=186.4s)]
*  And of course that's cell phones down. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=190.0s)]
*  I think that's an important thing to do. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=192.68s)]
*  What we do with meetings is like... [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=195.08s)]
*  Inside of company, we do a bunch of things. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  We periodically delete all meetings, recurring meetings because it seems very hard for people [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=199.8s)]
*  to subtract. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  It's very easy to add. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  That only leads one way. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=210.44s)]
*  So we have ceremonies like this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  It would be interesting what would happen if everyone would have to zero some of their [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  follow list. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=219.68s)]
*  Zero budget, their follow list. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=220.68s)]
*  I think that would significantly change people's experience with social media. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=223.16s)]
*  I wonder if that's a good idea. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=227.04s)]
*  Also with your friendships, it's striking to me when I'm in Italy, I very often see [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=228.96s)]
*  what I call street conferences. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=233.28s)]
*  That is people talking to each other often heatedly and they're standing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=235.4s)]
*  When I'm in Germany, people are talking to each other heatedly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=239.32s)]
*  They tend to be sitting. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=242.26s)]
*  Do you have a similar impression? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=243.26s)]
*  What a fascinating observation. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=246.32s)]
*  You know, the idea, amtisch, it's something very German about it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=248.68s)]
*  You can pound your fist on the table. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=251.84s)]
*  It's a Stammtisch really. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=253.32s)]
*  I think in both instances people do something which I think has a lot of relevance to the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=257.12s)]
*  sort of real life versus social media conundrum that people are wrestling with, which is that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=262.48s)]
*  I think there's a significant human need unacknowledged for venting. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=268.48s)]
*  I think venting is one of those extremely important outlets. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=273.36s)]
*  It's sort of our original safe space in a way where at some point people say, okay, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=282.8s)]
*  well, you're clearly off. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=286.48s)]
*  At least people say this to me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=287.48s)]
*  I can go pretty far in venting. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=289.44s)]
*  Germans can be going very far. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  Stereotypes are funny because they often are too. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=295.44s)]
*  Venting catastrophizing, these kind of things, and then having your friends reel you in. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=299.64s)]
*  The issue I think we've seen over especially sort of beginning of this decade is as people [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=302.88s)]
*  like ported their venting online and then got their sort of one take retreated forever [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=308.32s)]
*  because it just captured the imagination. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=314.44s)]
*  I feel people misunderstood what was actually going on for a little bit and I hope everyone [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=317.24s)]
*  has sort of acclimatized to this reality now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=322.8s)]
*  So how do we create safe outlets for venting in companies or institutions? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=325.58s)]
*  What is it that one does? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=329.82s)]
*  Because you don't want it to turn into negative contagion, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  I actually think even just talking about venting being a thing that's actually good and prefixing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=335.52s)]
*  when someone just wants to actually just say, get a bunch of things, like field test some [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=341.32s)]
*  takes is a good idea. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=346.8s)]
*  I think that can disable the power of it spiraling everyone right after. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=348.68s)]
*  I think that's useful. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=355.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=357.44s)]
*  I've seen, I didn't go to it because it wasn't in my neck of the woods, but I've seen parties [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=358.44s)]
*  organized or evenings organized now where everyone gets a note with a outrageous position [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=365.04s)]
*  that they are supposed to represent for the rest of the evening and then they're supposed [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=373.4s)]
*  to tear it up and toss it away. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=379.36s)]
*  Just to allow people to have plausible deniability of whatever they want to talk about because [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=382.36s)]
*  they just fall on, oh, I was told to represent this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=386.4s)]
*  I think that seems like, I don't know if it's a good idea, but I love that someone is trying [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=389.44s)]
*  this because that seems like a social license to actually talk about stuff that otherwise [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  can't be talked about and seeing where it leads. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  Often it leads to exactly the wrong place and then you get that out of your system and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  then you don't need to share this as a tweet afterwards. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=409.56s)]
*  Are German meetings different? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=414.32s)]
*  How? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=415.32s)]
*  I'm German. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=417.2s)]
*  I grew up for 20 years in Germany. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=418.2s)]
*  I then moved to Canada. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=419.2s)]
*  You're from Koblenz, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=420.2s)]
*  I'm from Koblenz. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=421.2s)]
*  I celebrated 2000 years when I was a teenager there. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=422.2s)]
*  Julius Caesar might have come through and that was probably the most exciting thing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=430.4s)]
*  that ever happened there. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=433.52s)]
*  I think it goes back into the stereotypes culture. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=439.28s)]
*  Again, I'm German. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=442.44s)]
*  I started a company with another German both in Canada for Americans. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=445.16s)]
*  So, like, Shopify is sort of interesting. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  A million of different cultures. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=451.24s)]
*  I think that, well, I mean, straight off the bat, it's Germans just are blunt. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=454.6s)]
*  Like there's just no shit sandwich configuration that needs to be constructed to say if something [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=462.0s)]
*  is bad. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=468.70000000000005s)]
*  I think the Germans have a more innately higher quality bar and less tolerance for underperformance [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=469.7s)]
*  on that quality bar. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=478.42s)]
*  It's pretty like products are either below it or good, great work class above it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=479.65999999999997s)]
*  But below that, nothing else registers as anything of value. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=490.18s)]
*  It's totally different in North America. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=493.18s)]
*  I think that's good and bad that comes from this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  I think sort of a cultural appreciation for good products, craftsmanship done right and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=496.74s)]
*  so on is something that's more associated with Europe. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=502.76s)]
*  But the quick iteration, be embarrassed by the first version and then build from there [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=509.46000000000004s)]
*  is something that North America does better. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=515.4s)]
*  And so it's interesting. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=518.04s)]
*  I've seen this in meetings where people fell on cultural lines of, you know, is this, should [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=522.0s)]
*  we ship this? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=528.08s)]
*  Should we not ship this? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=529.08s)]
*  Is it valuable to build this way or should we spend a couple of like, spend months and [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=530.08s)]
*  months and months trying to figure out exactly what to build and then build that and try [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=535.0400000000001s)]
*  to get it as close and perfect as possible or should we just like iterate very, very [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=538.24s)]
*  quickly? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  And so, yes, they go differently. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=543.1600000000001s)]
*  Are Canadians different in meetings than US Americans? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=545.76s)]
*  Yeah, as well. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=550.36s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=552.36s)]
*  It's more on the side of American, definitely on a minimum quality bar. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=554.4s)]
*  I think Canadians are often more about long term, like just like, like, I've seen Canadians [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=563.04s)]
*  more often think about what's the next step after this step, but also just lower ambition. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=570.72s)]
*  That's probably not the most popular thing to say around here, but like Canada has sometimes, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=577.64s)]
*  like Canada's problem often culturally is a go for bronze mentality and which apparently [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=583.6s)]
*  is not uncommon for smaller countries attached to significantly more cultural or just bigger [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  countries. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=599.24s)]
*  But I think it's, it's actually, I found it's very easy to look around because I think [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=601.24s)]
*  it's, if someone, you know, I think a lot of our success has been due to, you know, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=607.72s)]
*  just me and my co-founder basically allowing everyone to go for work class and everyone's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=614.96s)]
*  like, oh, okay, well, if we're allowed to do this, then let's go. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=618.92s)]
*  And I think that makes a big difference. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=622.0s)]
*  This is like ratcheting up the ambition for a project is something that one has to do [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=624.24s)]
*  in a company like in Canada. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=631.52s)]
*  But is there something scarce that is needed to inject that into Canada and Canadians or [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=634.48s)]
*  is it simply a matter of someone showing up and doing it and then it just all falls out [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=640.32s)]
*  and happens? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=643.72s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=644.72s)]
*  In as much as shop for maybe seen as something that succeeded, that alone didn't do it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=647.32s)]
*  So it would have been very, very nice if that would happen. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=653.08s)]
*  Now there's like another court of founders coming through who are like some of them have [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=658.64s)]
*  been part of Shopify or come back from a valley. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=663.64s)]
*  There's some great companies in Calgary like Neo that are more ambitious, but like it's, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  I think that, I think it's a decision. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=673.5200000000001s)]
*  I think it's a bit of a decision and I would like the time it worked perfectly was when [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=677.4s)]
*  Canada was hosting Winter Olympics, which is now a little bit of ancient history, but [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=686.8s)]
*  there was actually a program Canada wide that's called Own the Podium, which because you know, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=690.28s)]
*  that makes sense. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=695.72s)]
*  Like it's home, we love, we have more winter than most. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=696.72s)]
*  So therefore let's do well. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=699.4s)]
*  And then we did, like it's just like by far the best performance of Canada Olympic team [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=703.12s)]
*  of all times. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=707.84s)]
*  So I do wonder if it's actually, like I think to systematize it and make it stick, that's [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=711.48s)]
*  changing a culture is very, very difficult, but instances of just like giving everyone [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=720.24s)]
*  permission to go for it have also been super successful. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=725.52s)]
*  Why were you miserable in German school? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=729.72s)]
*  I think because German school at that time was in love with serializing out answers and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  trying to fill you up with as many answers as possible and hope that you would be able [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=743.64s)]
*  to apply them to problems you encounter later. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if there's a good theory for that being a sensible approach that would [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=751.44s)]
*  stand up to reason. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=758.32s)]
*  It certainly didn't work for me. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=760.12s)]
*  I kind of am literally upset. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=761.44s)]
*  I need to have every problem before again. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=763.12s)]
*  I have learned the answer to it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=765.6800000000001s)]
*  And that just was in stark contrast. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=768.24s)]
*  You know, what we're being taught in the nineties and so and during this times was like in stark [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  contrast with what was interesting for, you know, working with computers. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=779.0s)]
*  That was really just like the most fun thing for me to do during this time and seemed very [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  valuable even then. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=786.36s)]
*  And you know, this probably sounds too abstract. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=788.76s)]
*  Like Latin as first extra language is just like not highly utilitarian. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=793.2s)]
*  And that is not like knowing Latin is very rarely the correct answer to questions you [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=798.28s)]
*  might encounter later in life. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=804.4s)]
*  So it's not saying it's not valuable in some way, but maybe like start with English. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=806.08s)]
*  That would be a good start. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=810.76s)]
*  But there's plenty of technical talent in Germany and plenty of young people speak English [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=812.68s)]
*  quite well. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=817.8399999999999s)]
*  Why aren't there more German tech giants? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=819.12s)]
*  I mean, the hot take here on this is like there are, they're called Shopify and Palantir [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=824.12s)]
*  and others, right? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=831.92s)]
*  Like it's so it's. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  But in Germany, Germany is not a tiny nation. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=838.28s)]
*  The EU is of course a large market. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=840.56s)]
*  Enough of you speak English to have a common language. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  I would like I would love to know. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=847.4399999999999s)]
*  I honestly I think about this a lot, but I don't know if I have the best person to analyze [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  it because it's like what I'm hearing and it makes sense. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=854.8399999999999s)]
*  It's just that tech is something that Americans do from the perspective of Germans. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=860.68s)]
*  And it's like it's I think I really don't think the general population believes that [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=868.12s)]
*  is truly like tech is adding a lot to life. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=873.4s)]
*  It's seen as a this may be a reflection of areas I go to visit. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=878.6s)]
*  Again, I mostly visit family and friends in smaller like not the tech centers of Germany [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=884.96s)]
*  having these conversations. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=892.6s)]
*  There is a very much pessimism about the future that I think means you cannot build tech companies [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=895.92s)]
*  because you kind of have to be optimistic about the future. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=902.52s)]
*  Like otherwise, why would you want to contribute to progress and making it come to be faster? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  So I think that's one thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  I think it's very hard to hire staff that's willing like the like in North America, I [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=916.68s)]
*  found that people take big chances to if they believe and have conviction in a company [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=923.76s)]
*  doing something, they would leave an excellent career to give it a go. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=929.3199999999999s)]
*  And it just like also seems to not be true in Germany. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=936.0s)]
*  So like access to excellent talent is just simply harder by some men making culturally [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=939.0s)]
*  decisions differently, partly because I think startups are a low status pursuit from the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=944.92s)]
*  best I can tell. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=950.72s)]
*  Say we compare Germany to the Netherlands, which is culturally pretty similar, very close [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=953.32s)]
*  to Koblenz. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=957.96s)]
*  They have ASML, Aden, Netherlands is a smaller country. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=958.96s)]
*  Why have they done relatively better? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=965.24s)]
*  Or you could cite Sweden again, culturally not so distant from Germany. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  You're asking very good questions that I much rather would ask you, you know. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't think I have. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=976.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=978.7600000000001s)]
*  I wish I know. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=979.7600000000001s)]
*  I started a small company in Germany, didn't do anything. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=981.2s)]
*  So it's not like people didn't do this. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=988.68s)]
*  And I came to Canada again, this time it worked. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=990.96s)]
*  And then I was headstone for a very long time building my thing because it just like was [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=995.56s)]
*  consuming. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=999.64s)]
*  So like I didn't pay too much attention to you. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1000.64s)]
*  I wasn't even very deliberate about where I started a company. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1003.88s)]
*  I started in Ottawa and because that's where me and my wife were during the time she was [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1006.04s)]
*  studying there. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1010.12s)]
*  And then we could find great talent there that was overlooked it seemed and gave everyone [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1011.2s)]
*  projects to be ambitious with and it worked. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1019.4s)]
*  And you know, I think that if you create in a geography, a consensus that your company [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1022.2s)]
*  that really, really is worth working for because it's interesting work, great work and might [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1027.76s)]
*  actually lead to something, then you can build it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1031.94s)]
*  And I think this is something that I don't quite understand why this is not possible [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1034.6s)]
*  to do in so many places in Germany because again, Germany does have this wonderful appreciation [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1041.1399999999999s)]
*  of craftsmanship, which I think is actually underrepresented in software. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's only recently, usually by Europeans being brought up. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1052.04s)]
*  about it more and more and certainly I do too. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1059.72s)]
*  Making software is a craft and I think in this way, Germany, Czech Republic, other places, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1066.2s)]
*  Poland are like extremely enlightened in making this part of apprenticeship system and I apprenticed [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1074.56s)]
*  as a computer programmer and I thought it was exactly the right way to learn these things. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1080.1200000000001s)]
*  Now that means there's, I believe a lot of talent that then makes decisions other than [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1085.6s)]
*  putting it together to build ambitious startups and so something needs to be uncorked by the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  people who have more insight than I have. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  I think part of a hypothesis is that the Netherlands and also Sweden are somewhat happier countries [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1099.6799999999998s)]
*  than Germany. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1106.4399999999998s)]
*  People smile more, at least superficially, the more optimistic, the more going. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1107.6799999999998s)]
*  It's striking to me that Germans, contrary to stereotype, I think they have a quite good [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1113.56s)]
*  sense of humor, but a lot of it is irony or somewhat black and maybe that's bad for tech [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1117.32s)]
*  and I wonder people in the Bay Area, I mean, do they have a great sense of humor? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1124.08s)]
*  I'm not sure they do. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1127.9199999999998s)]
*  Maybe there's some correlations across those variables. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1131.08s)]
*  I think they actually banned humor for a little while from the Bay Area. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1133.44s)]
*  I think it might make a comeback now. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1136.36s)]
*  I really do think that it seems like an easy out, but it's actually potentially... [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1140.04s)]
*  The optimism angle is loud bearing for this. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  You've got to believe that the future is going to be better than today to want to make the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1149.48s)]
*  future come sooner, which is in your tiny, tiny, tiny little way. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1153.48s)]
*  I'm not talking about every company's changing the world, but every company is causing... [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1159.68s)]
*  If you want it to work, it's causing progress, both add to the vector of progress, but also [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1164.74s)]
*  maybe just change some trajectory in some space a little bit. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1171.98s)]
*  I think if Shopify wouldn't have happened, something like this might be a highly distributed, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1176.22s)]
*  like many, many pieces of software or something else would be there. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1181.14s)]
*  It would not look like Shopify. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1185.22s)]
*  The world of computing is extremely path dependent, just like the other part of the world. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1187.26s)]
*  You want to be able to add something. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1193.44s)]
*  This is also why ignorance is usually useful because you should be ignorant to the low [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1195.64s)]
*  odds. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1202.2s)]
*  In the beginning, I think one of the reasons why at least some founders often are young. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1203.2s)]
*  These things are important. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1212.8s)]
*  Another aspect of the European Union, it's just people also study very long. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1215.3200000000002s)]
*  I know this has gotten updated in real time since I was there, but man, in my trips home, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1220.12s)]
*  I had a lot of 32-year-old student friends. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1225.6399999999999s)]
*  That's just like, cool. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1228.9199999999998s)]
*  There's a significant amount of Nobel prizes awarded to people for their work in their [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1231.6799999999998s)]
*  20s. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1237.52s)]
*  We should just have a clear cultural understanding that it was useful years to be out and building [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1238.52s)]
*  things. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1244.9199999999998s)]
*  Everything is single causal and I think there's a lot of contributing facts. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1248.64s)]
*  I would have trouble, I think, weighting them, but lack of optimism is the one I would put [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1252.5600000000002s)]
*  on the top of the list. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1259.2800000000002s)]
*  What is the German language word that you still use when you think because there's no [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1261.64s)]
*  close English language equivalent? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1265.76s)]
*  I don't have... [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1270.5600000000002s)]
*  Heimweh, right? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1271.5600000000002s)]
*  That's a possible contender. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1272.5600000000002s)]
*  Heimweh is... [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1273.5600000000002s)]
*  Sehnsucht. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1274.5600000000002s)]
*  Like Verschlimmbesser. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1275.5600000000002s)]
*  Sehnsucht. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1277.56s)]
*  Verschlimmbesserung is such a good word. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1278.56s)]
*  What that means is by trying to improve something, you made it worse. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1280.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe it's also born out of pessimism about the future, but it's just so wonderful because [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1290.2s)]
*  you see it often. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1294.36s)]
*  You know, chess and fans, people don't often know what parts of a large system are important [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1295.36s)]
*  that have a lot of cultural or technical understanding coded in them and which ones are just there [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1304.32s)]
*  because we were in a hurry building the system. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1309.76s)]
*  And sometimes you find out which is which very quickly afterwards and a word is useful. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1311.84s)]
*  How about Auseinandersetzung? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1319.12s)]
*  The process of coming to terms with something rather than just putting it out there. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1321.56s)]
*  But they are beautiful. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1326.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, even Gestalt is a word that isn't... [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1327.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that might actually have been integrated now in English, but there's no equivalent [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1330.08s)]
*  of that. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1337.32s)]
*  But the reverse is also interesting. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1338.32s)]
*  Entitlement is not a word that Germans have, which I find really, really interesting. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1347.24s)]
*  Sometimes in Shopify I have to explain to people when I say them don'ts, like, hey, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1354.4s)]
*  gratitude and entitlement are two sides of the spectrum. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1357.36s)]
*  And it's your choice where you are here after you have a pleasant experience or maybe with [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1361.04s)]
*  some downsides along the way. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1365.8799999999999s)]
*  Very important conversation to have with interns sometimes if, you know, if, I don't know, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1369.4399999999998s)]
*  provided food is cold or something like this. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1375.84s)]
*  So try to... [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1378.4399999999998s)]
*  I get in these situations where I sit down, okay, well, I'm doing this in German now because [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1381.7199999999998s)]
*  this is the moment where I have to roll out this thing and then I'm just like struggling [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1384.88s)]
*  because there's no term. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1388.2800000000002s)]
*  And I'm like, that's an interesting fact that we don't have a word for this. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1389.7600000000002s)]
*  So this happens as well. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1394.0800000000002s)]
*  Now of course, someone's going to send me like a string like this, which actually perfectly [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  represents it and does a better... [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1399.3200000000002s)]
*  But anyway, nothing I could easily recall. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1401.16s)]
*  Do you still read books in German? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1404.7600000000002s)]
*  Occasionally. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1407.5200000000002s)]
*  I have like, I must read one book in German a year as a sort of self policy, which I have [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1409.6000000000001s)]
*  violated last year, which I was not like super happy about. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1417.4s)]
*  But like, it's like... [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1422.16s)]
*  One thing I find disappointing is when, you know, like obviously I take the opportunities [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1427.0800000000002s)]
*  when I want to go through something that's originally written in German that I'm going [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1432.3200000000002s)]
*  to try to read this in original. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1437.36s)]
*  So like Wittenstein's Trakata is an example of this. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  It's like the English translation is so much better because the translator asked for so [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1446.6s)]
*  many clarification by Wittenstein, but it just ends up being like readable. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1451.04s)]
*  So I found a book which was actually beautifully said. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1455.52s)]
*  I think the MIT published it of like the original German, the English translation and a translation [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1460.56s)]
*  back to German from the English translation all in three columns and that was perfect. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1466.24s)]
*  So sometimes the English translations also just often get updated again, like for Kant [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1470.36s)]
*  or something like this. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1476.76s)]
*  And I do, I'm actually a fan of rewriting books, like every, I don't know, 25, 50 years [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1479.08s)]
*  for two generations down the line because they just get hard to access. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1486.4s)]
*  So often you get that by reading the English translation. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1491.64s)]
*  So I'm trying to, I feel like I lose opportunities to do this. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1494.48s)]
*  In your opinion, where exactly is the dividing line between North Germany and South Germany? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1498.52s)]
*  So people in Freiburg, they'll say like, oh, it's Mannheim, but that's insane, right? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1505.08s)]
*  Where is it for you? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, you asked me to poke horns in this tier, which I'm going to have too many unhappy [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1512.3600000000001s)]
*  people by actually committing at all to this question. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1518.8s)]
*  So I'm going to take a pass. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1521.84s)]
*  I would say Limburg is still South Germany because historically it's been Catholic, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1523.68s)]
*  but somewhere not too far north of Limburg, North Germany would start. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1528.48s)]
*  It's very hard to draw a straight line, but you end up with a very, very, very jagged [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1533.96s)]
*  line. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1538.16s)]
*  I think if you're trying to do a best possible job there, anyway, lots happened in Germany [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1539.16s)]
*  for a long time to cause culture to be calcified to wherever it is now. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1546.0800000000002s)]
*  Canada, in the data I see right now, Canada seems to be having a per capita GDP recession. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1552.96s)]
*  And I'm not sure how to interpret that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1560.24s)]
*  The US has been growing at a decent clip. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1562.2800000000002s)]
*  Europe more or less steady growing at a very slow pace. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1566.48s)]
*  Why in per capita terms does Canada seem to be moving backwards? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1569.44s)]
*  Is that a composition effect or how do you read that? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1572.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this worries me a great deal. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1576.96s)]
*  I don't know if we saw this. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1582.72s)]
*  I mean, okay. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1585.6000000000001s)]
*  So comparing to the United States is a bad idea in general. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1586.88s)]
*  I mean, actually it's the best possible idea if you're going for optimism, but it's not [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1590.8400000000001s)]
*  the best idea if you are looking for staying sane, right? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1594.8s)]
*  America is exceptional. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1601.44s)]
*  It's an unbelievable economic might. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1602.44s)]
*  It's an unbelievable country in so many ways. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1606.82s)]
*  You hear in every country, well, if you compare to the United States in this one thing, things [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1611.06s)]
*  are bad. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1615.82s)]
*  I mean, I think the comparison of Germany to Netherlands makes a lot more sense. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1616.82s)]
*  I think that's where you can figure out what might be actionable. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1621.86s)]
*  America is just like really, really, really, really different. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1627.4199999999998s)]
*  So first of all that. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1629.5s)]
*  Every once in a while, Canada has an economy that really can hang with America. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1630.98s)]
*  I think 2000 years of 1455, it was looking really, really well. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1635.06s)]
*  I think what happened there, again, nothing has a singularly causal, but the productivity [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1639.86s)]
*  numbers are just really low. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1649.4199999999998s)]
*  And I think the employment in the public sector having grown the degree it has, it's just [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1651.3s)]
*  Again, I don't know if it's causally related or correlation with the same thing, but it [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1660.1s)]
*  just is pretty clear to me that if the ratio of referees to builders or critics to builders [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1667.78s)]
*  is going out of whack, that things grind to a halt. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1675.82s)]
*  So we saw this in even Shopify adoption. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1679.1799999999998s)]
*  It just took a lot longer for Canada to want digital products. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1684.1s)]
*  And Shopify is always selling and finding its best customers in the United States for [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1690.86s)]
*  the first 10 years easily. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1697.4199999999998s)]
*  And then you have already, like if you believe me, Shopify is pretty good. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1698.9399999999998s)]
*  Now there's a compounding advantage for people who have adopted it earlier. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1703.4199999999998s)]
*  And I think that is sort of like a tiny zoom of a much bigger fractal that I think is at [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1706.7s)]
*  play there. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1714.1000000000001s)]
*  How has Canada changed the most since you moved there? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1715.42s)]
*  It feels like it's the optimism angle. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1721.66s)]
*  And I think this is like a thing that worries me the most. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1723.54s)]
*  I think Canada had a massively underappreciated at the time project in multiculturalism that [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1726.5s)]
*  worked. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1732.9s)]
*  And it started under Pierre Trudeau really just putting country together with great leadership, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1734.38s)]
*  great vision. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1742.42s)]
*  And Canada had a string of leaders that were like kind of almost too good for a small country. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1743.42s)]
*  And there was like this, hey, we are getting along well, we are friendly, it's a high trust [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1749.14s)]
*  environment and the best days are going to be ahead of us. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1758.82s)]
*  And I think it's so hard to point at exactly what changed it. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1764.3s)]
*  But the cultural narrative has just simply shifted now. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1771.34s)]
*  I do think people are a little bit more circumspect and looking at the country, I think the sort [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1776.46s)]
*  of problems are more clear. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1783.9399999999998s)]
*  It's like there's a lot hanging on real estate and real estate is not by itself. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1785.94s)]
*  It's valuable to a second order because of all other sort of things being valuable. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1793.5400000000002s)]
*  I think the worst thing is like this, from my perspective, is this that Canada seems [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1799.14s)]
*  to be okay just exporting the raw materials for everything. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1807.22s)]
*  And that started as beaver pelts being sent to London for turning into high margin hats. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1810.86s)]
*  And Canada has no refineries, it all goes to Houston, even more produces a good deal [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1817.74s)]
*  of energy. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1822.1399999999999s)]
*  And Waterloo is basically a raw material export as well as one of the greatest schools in [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1826.3s)]
*  planet Earth. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1832.4599999999998s)]
*  And Waterloo students are a lot bearing for Silicon Valley companies. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1834.82s)]
*  And there's a lot of readiness to export the CEO cultural conversation about maybe [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1840.18s)]
*  we should have people build things here as well. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1849.14s)]
*  It seems like a country which now has so little self-confidence that I see this as running [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1855.42s)]
*  Shopify. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1865.02s)]
*  A huge amount of our employees we hired last year, I think it was 60% or so of our engineers [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1866.02s)]
*  were boomerangs coming back from storied American companies. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1875.94s)]
*  Most of them were Canadian because like, and often they say this because we wanted to work [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1880.66s)]
*  for Apple because my parents said, man, you're really doing well in tech, you might actually [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1888.9s)]
*  get a real job in that Apple. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1893.1s)]
*  And if you hear this a lot, you do and then you go there and you know what, you actually [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1898.1s)]
*  like that job and then you come back. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1902.26s)]
*  And I think this kind of thing needs to happen. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1904.62s)]
*  We need to have some wealthy stories out there. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1908.2199999999998s)]
*  Canada is a pretty good country. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1910.4199999999998s)]
*  I think it's a major asset to the United States as a great friend. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1913.1799999999998s)]
*  And I think a stronger Canada is better for absolutely everyone. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1917.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you agree with the stereotype that Canada is especially weak when it comes to branding? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1922.38s)]
*  So there's Shopify, there's Molson, you could say there's hockey, NHL, but not that many [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1927.58s)]
*  Canadian brands. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1933.26s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1935.34s)]
*  Or do you balance the premise? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1936.34s)]
*  Because Canada exports no products. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1938.14s)]
*  But Shopify and Lululemon export, I'm sure forgetting, I mean Molson, sure. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1940.14s)]
*  But like, I don't think it's like not ability to do branding. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1945.66s)]
*  It's just Canada does not appreciate commercialization of any kind. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1949.42s)]
*  It's like Canada wants to invent. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1953.5s)]
*  It's remarkable how many papers that are foundational to the current evolution of AI boom are in [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1960.3400000000001s)]
*  the University of Toronto, Waterloo papers, Jeff Hinton and his lab and so on. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1968.18s)]
*  And it seems it's seen as a low status thing to do to then go and try to build a business [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1974.66s)]
*  around it. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1987.8200000000002s)]
*  But you know, it's probably amazing from the perspective of our neighbors, but like, probably [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1988.8200000000002s)]
*  not so good for the wealth of a country. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1995.3000000000002s)]
*  Like, we are not metabolizing any of the kind of innovation. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=1998.6200000000001s)]
*  Shopify is very much an aberration here as like, let's make something that at least was [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2003.86s)]
*  a brand to businesses initially and increasingly people beyond businesses recognize it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2008.4599999999998s)]
*  And so yeah, I think that is an important thing. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2015.82s)]
*  Like it's the same thing as like, hey, we don't refine more or we don't make the hats [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2020.62s)]
*  for from the beavers or, you know, we just don't create the final product. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2024.4199999999998s)]
*  We send the raw materials everywhere. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2028.6999999999998s)]
*  And I would, if I could change one thing, it's I would do that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2030.94s)]
*  I would put like, and by the way, this is deeply encoded in policy, right? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2034.9s)]
*  So there's a thing called SRED tax credits. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2040.5s)]
*  I'm not gonna bore you with the details there, but like, you can claim those too, if you [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2045.02s)]
*  do says research in development and try to claim them for anything that's commercially [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2049.2200000000003s)]
*  related. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2057.94s)]
*  Actually, it's remarkable. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2058.94s)]
*  We at various points stopped just applying for them just because we were just too commercial [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2060.54s)]
*  in lots of ways. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2066.82s)]
*  So you're being paid for doing original research, which I think is a great policy, like because [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2067.82s)]
*  some like often original research kind of could need a boost. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2072.2200000000003s)]
*  But then going and turning this into a product, you're like completely left out. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2076.98s)]
*  Like if you want to claim anything, you will have to ask every one of your people and the [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2081.16s)]
*  meticulous time sheets and submit an ungodly burden of documentation, which literally makes [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2086.62s)]
*  the commercialization jobs terrible. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2092.7s)]
*  And so therefore, you know, it's like the good people don't want to work in this environment [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2095.1s)]
*  and so on, so on, so on. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2101.9s)]
*  Do you think in Canada, there will be an enduring backlash against immigration? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2102.9s)]
*  I don't mean the phony student visas. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2107.58s)]
*  Let's assume that's taken care of. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2109.46s)]
*  But immigration as it had been proceeding, is that the standing equilibrium? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2111.54s)]
*  Or is that going to dwindle an asymptote? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2115.5s)]
*  So Canada is about I don't know if it's accurate numbers, but I think there's a directionally [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2117.82s)]
*  right. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2122.3s)]
*  This is a kind of about 41 million people in the last three years, three million people [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2123.3s)]
*  immigrated to Canada, which is a significant percentage increase in size of population. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2128.5s)]
*  There is a lot of cultural conversation about this. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2136.3s)]
*  I think the cover most of the conversation that I see is not really about the veracity [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2138.46s)]
*  of immigration in general, but actually about like the sort of fact that in this time of [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2145.7400000000002s)]
*  adding three million immigrants, we added like almost no housing, which is like so that's [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2153.82s)]
*  it. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2159.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, just that's that's just like not a great idea to do that. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2160.2200000000003s)]
*  And that's causing a lot of bad downstream effects. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2163.58s)]
*  My entire 20 years I've been here doing something been very popular in Canada, which I thought [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2168.92s)]
*  was one of the most unique parts of the country. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2174.0s)]
*  That's sort of part of a statement I made earlier about an almost unacknowledged effortlessness [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2176.8s)]
*  to multiculturalism that that worked. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2183.0s)]
*  And Canada also implemented the thing that everyone's talking about a skills based visa [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2187.12s)]
*  program with point systems, which is well designed and has been doing a lot of work [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2193.96s)]
*  for Canada in the past. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2201.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not quite clear to me why we walked away from sort of these priors that have clearly [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2204.0s)]
*  identified to work all of it. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2211.04s)]
*  And it's certainly like things in policy land changed and opinions changed. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2213.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't think people like this experiment. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2219.2000000000003s)]
*  My significant hope is that this is not going to be one of those baby out of a bath water [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2222.16s)]
*  moments because we have a great skill system, immigration system. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2226.92s)]
*  I think to kind of just like fall back on that and, you know, run that up. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2231.48s)]
*  Why does Ottawa remain such an underrated city? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2236.8799999999997s)]
*  So Americans will take a three day trip to Toronto or Montreal. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2239.5s)]
*  But Ottawa is excellent. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2243.5s)]
*  There's the National Museum, very good food. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2244.5s)]
*  Obviously it's nation's capital. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2248.04s)]
*  Why does it stay so unknown? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2250.5s)]
*  What a wonderful setup. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2252.18s)]
*  And it's close, right? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2253.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2254.68s)]
*  Thank you for the platform. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2255.68s)]
*  It's a wonderful city. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2256.68s)]
*  Like I, you know, we will. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2257.68s)]
*  I mean, it's not we ended up there because my wife was born there, but then actually [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2260.9s)]
*  studied there. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2264.76s)]
*  I didn't maybe not expecting to go back and then we stayed for 20 years and we built it [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2265.76s)]
*  like Shopify, built a great company there because it's just like people really love [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2269.54s)]
*  it there and they were like itching for better employers, I suppose. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2275.7s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, obviously it also gets really cold. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2279.5s)]
*  I had these wonderful parts, like my commute to work was the canals, skating on the canal [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2286.1s)]
*  every day and where else in the world can you have a commute like this? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2292.62s)]
*  But also, you know, the first time I visited, it was really, really cold in winter and I [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2297.16s)]
*  sort of had my questions. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2301.98s)]
*  And then the summer you go to a cottage and that's just like the other side of the whole [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2303.46s)]
*  thing. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2309.38s)]
*  And it's just like, it's a wonderful quality of life. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2310.38s)]
*  And I think that matters. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2313.58s)]
*  Don't you have the world's largest outdoor ice skating rink and it's seven kilometers [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2316.34s)]
*  or something? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2320.38s)]
*  Yeah, that was my commute. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2321.38s)]
*  That was your commute, all seven kilometers or how much of it? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2324.38s)]
*  Well, maybe two of those was a commute. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2327.58s)]
*  It was right off of downtown and then we were living along the canal like two blocks in. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2331.2999999999997s)]
*  And it was very cool. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2335.54s)]
*  Very nice thing. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2337.54s)]
*  Nice way to start the day. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2339.22s)]
*  I'm sure I wrote my best code those days. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2341.06s)]
*  The future of the internet. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2344.9s)]
*  When will virtual reality stores matter? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2346.1s)]
*  That's a very specific, that's a good question. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2348.3399999999997s)]
*  Virtual reality stores, I don't have a great answer there. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2354.18s)]
*  I don't think they will port the exact, like the fifth avenue boutiques online other than [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2360.02s)]
*  for having virtual twins for them, for people who specifically want to see those. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2366.66s)]
*  I don't think this is going to be, the future of e-commerce is going to be strolling through [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2372.86s)]
*  malls or virtual malls or these kind of things. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2380.2599999999998s)]
*  So I think the exact way this is all going to compose is going to be different. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2382.82s)]
*  I think the innovation in virtual reality are going to be much more about virtual avatars [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2387.14s)]
*  or real people helping you. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2394.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just like talking to the product. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2397.14s)]
*  Shopify represents mostly the catalog of product that people really want rather than the necessities. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2399.2999999999997s)]
*  The fifth avenue boutiques would also be ones using Shopify. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2406.3399999999997s)]
*  And purchases are a lot more deliberate around this. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2410.66s)]
*  People often spend weeks thinking about this as something they would like to purchase and [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2413.9s)]
*  they're really looking forward to a package arriving, hopefully very quickly. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2418.54s)]
*  And so I think there's lots and lots and lots of touch points there. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2422.98s)]
*  The place that is probably the most virtual area that we see is already like furniture. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2426.46s)]
*  Like, placing the couch in your living room is just better than looking at it in some [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2431.78s)]
*  store. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2438.5s)]
*  So I think we see the early innings in this and there's a couple of technologies that [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2440.46s)]
*  we are tracking like, Gaussian splats and these kind of things that are just like going [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2444.02s)]
*  to make it vastly simpler for people to make digital twins available from whatever they [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2448.98s)]
*  manage to put together in real life. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2458.62s)]
*  And so I think a bunch of this is coming, but I don't know what's the date and what [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2460.66s)]
*  exactly is the form factor. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2465.42s)]
*  Talking about back office, but actual retail. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2468.06s)]
*  Do you see in advance how AI is going to be changing retail and what does that look like? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2472.02s)]
*  I think it will play a significant role for sure. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2478.5s)]
*  Change retail, I think it will also, I mean, I think we will see significantly better products [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2484.34s)]
*  being made. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2488.9s)]
*  I have an extremely bullish view on AI, specifically around the utilitarian value. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2490.7400000000002s)]
*  I think there's enormous advantages for company building. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2499.26s)]
*  I think there's enormous advantages for product creation. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2502.6600000000003s)]
*  I think what we engineers experience around co-pilots just right now getting good that [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2504.78s)]
*  are helping us do the job that we already have a significant craft in, but like do it [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2514.14s)]
*  better is extremely convincing. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2519.62s)]
*  And I think people would want a co-pilot or a sidekick or something like this along more [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2523.8599999999997s)]
*  of the things they do, which are like at the edges of their ability, which I think in a [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2530.58s)]
*  retail world on the creation side of businesses and on a creation side of products, it's just [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2537.5s)]
*  basically all the time, it's a stretch, it's a way. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2543.5s)]
*  You put yourself out there, you create the best thing. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2546.34s)]
*  It's a deeply personal thing to create the first version of product that you try to create [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2549.06s)]
*  a company around. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2554.3s)]
*  And so I think that's really, really powerful, like highly intelligent, very knowledgeable, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2555.82s)]
*  zero judgment, always available, fast returning, even text AIs are going to be fantastic. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2563.06s)]
*  But increasingly, I think software is going to go through a rethink for this decade. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2572.74s)]
*  It's just quite clear that most software, like we have learned how to build excellent [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2583.7799999999997s)]
*  user interfaces, quite approachable, like we simplify enormously complex space to easy [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2593.06s)]
*  to reason about point decisions in a pretty approachable and legible interface, which [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2601.18s)]
*  also look good and all these kind of things. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2609.5s)]
*  That's sort of top of a hill we've been climbing for 20 years, or a little bit less since whatever [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2612.46s)]
*  moment you pick in which Web2O started, which really was the beginning of like the engineers [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2619.98s)]
*  saying, hey, we figure out a bit the applications of the internet. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2626.94s)]
*  And that's the string we've been pulling on for all these years. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2630.7000000000003s)]
*  And we've built all very, very valuable companies. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2634.78s)]
*  But that basically replaces going directly to the database or going to a command line. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2639.66s)]
*  We built like these interfaces. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2646.3s)]
*  I think now, instead of creating a place where someone can run around and switch a whole [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2647.58s)]
*  lot of toggles and change preferences to suit their particular idea, I think people can [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2654.66s)]
*  just tell us their goal. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2661.46s)]
*  And then we can work together on this. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2663.5s)]
*  I think goal oriented software is actually what we always wanted because that actually [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2664.94s)]
*  meets people where they are. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2668.8999999999996s)]
*  It's like how you work with colleagues together too. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2669.8999999999996s)]
*  And it's not, I'm actually really excited figuring out what this is going to look like. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2673.7799999999997s)]
*  I love the times where there's significant transition. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2676.8999999999996s)]
*  I thought the 2010s were kind of boring because we kind of just did the stuff that we figured [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2680.58s)]
*  out in the, sorry, the 20s were boring, 10s were, sorry, I should say this right. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2685.74s)]
*  2010 to 2020 was boring. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2691.22s)]
*  So because we basically just scaled the stuff we figured out towards the end of 2000 to [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2693.94s)]
*  2010 period. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2699.98s)]
*  And so now we're going to get into much more interesting times again. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2703.18s)]
*  And there's a lot to be figured out. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2706.02s)]
*  And that's exciting in the industry. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2707.74s)]
*  And I think what we'll end up is a much, much, much, much higher amount that you couldn't [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2709.7s)]
*  have seen from the original hills. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2714.62s)]
*  And so that's always exciting to me. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2716.62s)]
*  And I think it's going to be very valuable to people. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2719.06s)]
*  Now you work with so many retailers. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2721.46s)]
*  Do you feel you understand retail price stickiness? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2723.58s)]
*  Because economists don't. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2727.4199999999996s)]
*  A lot of economic models imply prices are sticky, but when they move, they should move [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2728.4199999999996s)]
*  a lot. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2732.8599999999997s)]
*  But you look at the data we have, it seems that big and small price movements are about [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2733.8599999999997s)]
*  equally likely, which means we as economists are fools. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2738.58s)]
*  How well do you understand all this? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2743.2s)]
*  I don't think I have a better line. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2746.02s)]
*  Honestly, I just like business are just so different that they are hard to average out. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2748.74s)]
*  And like, there are a lot of businesses that do their pricing strategies, aesthetics, and [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2754.14s)]
*  aesthetics is one of those hand ways that humans do to explain away enormous amount [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2759.9s)]
*  of background processing that goes into it in the best case scenario, like an entire [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2765.88s)]
*  career of knowledge rolled into an intuitive, quick decision or completely making it up. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2770.8s)]
*  Like both sides of a midwit meme here. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2778.8s)]
*  And I think economics fundamentally will have to roll a lot of data points into an average [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2783.6s)]
*  and then try to see which direction people do. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2793.92s)]
*  And there's a lot of canceling, shovel out going on in the spaces that we are concerned [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2796.6400000000003s)]
*  about. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2800.84s)]
*  But sort of interesting, I mean, we went through a high inflation period and just like tracking [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2801.84s)]
*  when prices in the system were kind of following. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2810.6400000000003s)]
*  That was deeply different based on what kind of products are and how people consider purchasing [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2815.2000000000003s)]
*  buying these products, obviously on margins too. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2822.16s)]
*  So again, I mean, I feel for the economists, because I don't think, you know, I think physics [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2825.2400000000002s)]
*  has given us a sense that there is a simple equation underneath everything. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2834.08s)]
*  And we've built an aesthetic around this. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2840.88s)]
*  And I think often too many other fields want to be more like physics. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2842.94s)]
*  And I think actually things are wonderful when they're complex. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2847.36s)]
*  I think, I don't know if you want to talk about company building, but companies are [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2851.56s)]
*  complex adaptive systems much more than being sort of industry applied versions of military, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2857.84s)]
*  slightly more complex organizations of military service. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2865.92s)]
*  That's a recognition which is not that old. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2868.96s)]
*  To a certain degree, it can explain why companies run by some of their engineering type people [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2876.2s)]
*  have been outperforming things because people have an incorrect understanding what engineering [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2883.4399999999996s)]
*  is and how it works. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2888.2799999999997s)]
*  Engineering is fundamentally, at least for the last 30 years, has mostly spent time on [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2890.08s)]
*  trying to take non-deterministic systems and make them deterministic, which is kind of [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2897.4199999999996s)]
*  what we do in the real world with policy mostly and process. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2901.48s)]
*  And so I think what we can do now, like if you're an engineer running a company, I think [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2909.04s)]
*  you come pre-equipped with ideas like systems thinking instead of, you know, World War II [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2914.96s)]
*  organizational structures. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2923.8s)]
*  And companies are the ultimate of non-deterministic systems that you're trying to get to build [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2925.72s)]
*  fantastic products at great pace, inclusive of all the creativity by various actors in [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2931.24s)]
*  a company and trying to build inside of it a culture, a story, incentive systems that [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2938.12s)]
*  are just making so that the maximum amount of everyone's activity actually, you know, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2945.24s)]
*  like for this mission. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2950.56s)]
*  And I find these things just so fascinating to think about because I, this is sort of [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2953.52s)]
*  going back to the beginning, I saw myself as an outsider and I've made a study of [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2964.96s)]
*  other fields from afar and I just, there's so many amazing ideas in basically any given [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2968.28s)]
*  field that you can possibly name or imagine. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2976.12s)]
*  Often what happens is like every field kind of reinvents the same core ideas and gives [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2978.88s)]
*  different names to them. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2984.4s)]
*  And making a study of doing this kind of thing and just saying, okay, well, how do we put [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2986.32s)]
*  better company? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2989.04s)]
*  I think companies are very bad, like all of them. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2990.04s)]
*  Like I think literally everyone, but I'm, me and my contemporaries, myself especially, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2992.28s)]
*  we're going to be terribly embarrassed by the companies we ran in the early 2020s. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=2998.84s)]
*  And so because there's all these things we didn't yet have or didn't yet understand [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3004.04s)]
*  or so, and then, you know, eventually we'll figure this out. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3007.88s)]
*  And then how could we even build anything before we figured out this thing? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3010.32s)]
*  Again, I find that just like such a interesting meta field of research. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3014.04s)]
*  It's almost applied good thinking. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3020.36s)]
*  Like, what if we never figure it out? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3021.8s)]
*  I mean, how sure are you that in the future it will be that much better? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3023.84s)]
*  We'll have better technology, but organization? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3028.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3031.88s)]
*  Well, we have, we have new primitives on which we can build. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3032.76s)]
*  Like sometimes also philosophies, right? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3036.32s)]
*  Like, but I'm not saying we're going to build a perfect company. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3037.92s)]
*  There's no, like everything is a set of trade-offs. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3040.1600000000003s)]
*  I just like compared, like if the best soccer team on planet Earth is like, gets at like [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3042.28s)]
*  80% of Hogwarts, 80% of perfection, you freeze frame the replay, everyone, very few people [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3050.48s)]
*  use a muscle that incorrectly while actually approaching the wall and then, you know, beautiful [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3058.76s)]
*  orchestration of, you know, cooperation without zero communication. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3064.16s)]
*  And, you know, that's like, what's a company? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3069.44s)]
*  A company is 5%. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3072.72s)]
*  How many memos are never read? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3075.2799999999997s)]
*  And like, partly because, so which to me tells you, if you just get to 6%, you're already [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3076.8799999999997s)]
*  doing better. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3084.96s)]
*  Like that's a pretty good way of not being as embarrassed as everyone else. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3085.44s)]
*  I think realistically, there's going to be a limit because these are not like soccer [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3089.04s)]
*  games, the same one every time you can actually practice for it. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3092.88s)]
*  Like a company's, you know, every day is a new day, a new puzzle box dumped on everyone's [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3095.2000000000003s)]
*  desk. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3099.04s)]
*  It's a different environment. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3100.4s)]
*  But still, like, I think companies are vastly better now. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3103.12s)]
*  Like, and I started as an engineer, even like, apprenticing under my master, he said, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3105.84s)]
*  you have two years after you start writing code for a project, after which it's like [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3111.52s)]
*  someone puts the mental code base and you're never going to change a thing again. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3116.08s)]
*  And that was just like accepted back then. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3118.88s)]
*  And now like, we have pieces of software that are 20 years old and feel the delight to work [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3120.72s)]
*  on because we just build up these understandings. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3126.72s)]
*  There's not like a lot of these lessons folk in other areas as well. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3130.0s)]
*  What do you think is the most common mistake your third party retailers make in modeling [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3133.4399999999996s)]
*  the world? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3138.0s)]
*  Thinking they have to build products that other people like. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3143.52s)]
*  I think this is the this is the sign killer. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3146.56s)]
*  It's just like Shopify is like, someone's called it Kevin Kelly's 1002 fans essay applied [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3148.8s)]
*  at scale. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3155.84s)]
*  It's like, like, yes, everyone's different. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3157.1200000000003s)]
*  But actually, there's clear clusters. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3163.52s)]
*  And the people who are willing to dedicate themselves to build a product and like, like, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3169.28s)]
*  go for that entire regular role and put themselves out there. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3174.8s)]
*  Well, actually, inside of a cluster more like the people everyone else wants to be. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3178.4s)]
*  And if they build things that they would love to have in the world, turns out that's they have [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3183.6s)]
*  extreme insight and authority over this rather than running. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3188.88s)]
*  So this is I'm a little bit like, there was some cross pollination from the lean startup book [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3192.4s)]
*  to the retail world. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3197.92s)]
*  I think that's especially in retail, this has been bad. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3199.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm actually wondering if that was such a good set of ideas. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3202.32s)]
*  I think there's good ideas in the book, but like, it feels a little bit ungenerous to just like, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3206.32s)]
*  I think customers are not the people who should say what needs to be built. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3212.88s)]
*  I think they need to explain their problems. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3216.96s)]
*  And it's like about it, like the builders have to figure out how to solve these problems better. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3218.56s)]
*  I think that's otherwise an abjection of vision. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3222.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think the best companies end up like following a long term vision and a long term mission. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3225.92s)]
*  So I think that's part of it. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3231.84s)]
*  And then the people who have access to capital, they under invest in growth. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3233.6s)]
*  That's that all this happens to. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3241.2799999999997s)]
*  Which I know it's scary to do internet marketing as getting harder and harder, but like, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3243.68s)]
*  it's not priced out yet. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3250.56s)]
*  So did you learn all this selling snowboards? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3252.08s)]
*  Or it took until Shopify? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3255.2799999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3257.52s)]
*  I mean, the reason why I love, I mean, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3258.1600000000003s)]
*  okay, so the greatest thing about running Shopify is like, my customers are like, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3264.96s)]
*  incredibly inspiring individuals, right? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3270.6400000000003s)]
*  Like it's like, it's, you know, it's, it's in a lot of places, it's very hard to convince [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3272.08s)]
*  people to actually talk to their customers. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3276.2400000000002s)]
*  It's actually like, sometimes our problem is the opposite. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3277.6s)]
*  We have too many people in conversations with our customers. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3280.48s)]
*  They are super open to sharing what they see and they're delightfully discontent with [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3284.8s)]
*  what we give them. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3290.56s)]
*  They will tell us how to do this better every single time, but they will also tell us, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3291.28s)]
*  here's why, because, you know, they, you know, they are entrepreneurs and Shopify is honestly [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3295.44s)]
*  like a celebration of, you know, sort of the small bits of capitalism. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3300.4s)]
*  It's like, we love entrepreneurship. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3305.6s)]
*  I should say like plenty of our customers are like, they're like, they're like, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3308.8s)]
*  I should say like plenty of our customers have started on Shopify and I know like absolutely [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3312.64s)]
*  massive billion dollar plus retailers. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3316.8799999999997s)]
*  So it's not, it's not like, you know, there's a great variety spending pretty much the entire [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3319.8399999999997s)]
*  spectrum of retail industry and size represented on the system now. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3325.6s)]
*  But a lot of the largest people who started on the platform, which now has been around [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3330.72s)]
*  for 20 years. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3337.12s)]
*  And, but we love entrepreneurship. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3338.08s)]
*  We love founding the concept of companies as a self-expression. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3342.4s)]
*  And, you know, just there's glory in entrepreneurship. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3348.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's actually, it's underappreciated. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3352.88s)]
*  It's like really, really, really, everyone talks about it and politicians always like, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3354.08s)]
*  like pro business formation, but like often the behavior doesn't confirm to this. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3357.28s)]
*  It keeps getting harder to policy wise as we talk about, you know, that's certainly [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3362.4s)]
*  an aspect in Germany as well. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3366.8s)]
*  It gets harder and harder to start companies in some places. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3371.2000000000003s)]
*  Again, the United States isn't the opposite. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3374.0800000000004s)]
*  There we have APIs to start businesses, which is exactly how things should be. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3377.1200000000003s)]
*  And so friction changes the behavior a lot of because everyone's allowed to be an [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3381.92s)]
*  intelligent actor in their local incentive system. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3388.0s)]
*  And if you're massively disincentivized of starting a company, then by just like BS, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3390.08s)]
*  you have to deal with and people want. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3397.76s)]
*  So we want to be a counter force to that. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3399.6s)]
*  We want to remove friction where we can. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3402.96s)]
*  Like, again, we can't, we can potentially advocate against bad policies, but we can [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3405.28s)]
*  do a lot about what happens after, you know, the policies stop mattering in the next step, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3410.96s)]
*  because every single time we have found every single time we've made shop fair more [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3415.12s)]
*  approachable or things that were previously complex and gating for people's success. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3421.3599999999997s)]
*  Every single time we made something significantly simpler, it actually caused more success. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3426.88s)]
*  More people who otherwise didn't make the hurdle and ended up making it through it. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3433.8399999999997s)]
*  And like not stopping is actually the thing that really, really leads to success in a [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3438.56s)]
*  reductionist way. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3443.92s)]
*  And so we find that just to be a really, really important discovery. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3445.52s)]
*  And then again, when we are part of a journey, I like to create the incentive systems and [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3451.36s)]
*  the business system of Shopify in such a way that we actually on the same side of the [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3460.08s)]
*  table with our customers. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3464.2400000000002s)]
*  Like best thing we can do to grow Shopify is make our customers more successful because [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3465.92s)]
*  we're in this together, economically speaking. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3470.72s)]
*  So they take an active role in talking to us, like every one of the product managers has [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3476.96s)]
*  like hundreds of WhatsApp conversations with active WhatsApp conversations with fast growing [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3481.84s)]
*  businesses. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3487.6s)]
*  And I think that's just kind of, that's a really, really, really fun way to build a business. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3488.4s)]
*  It's a very, very, very rare thing that your customers are. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3493.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like often the source of your inspiration. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3497.36s)]
*  What's an interesting book you've read lately? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3500.88s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3505.92s)]
*  Interesting book. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3507.1200000000003s)]
*  I've been sort of on a fantasy kick, which is not super conducive to that. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3508.2400000000002s)]
*  What do you learn about management from reading fantasy? [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3512.08s)]
*  You read Sanderson, right? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3515.44s)]
*  Am I correct? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3516.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3517.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3518.2400000000002s)]
*  I read Sanderson. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3518.88s)]
*  They're long. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3521.36s)]
*  They have commitments. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3523.52s)]
*  My son read the entire Stormlight Archive's four books on March break and I have such [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3525.2000000000003s)]
*  reading speed envy since then. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3531.36s)]
*  It takes me a lot, a lot longer. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3534.56s)]
*  I mean, I think fantasy is full. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3539.28s)]
*  I mean, fantasy is very often a mirror to society in some reductionist way. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3540.96s)]
*  So it's a sort of, it's a simulation. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3545.12s)]
*  It's a simpler scenario with some variables changed and any book that you don't like [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3546.88s)]
*  toss across the room is a book that usually has realistic characters that have some depth to them [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3552.88s)]
*  and following their story, given sort of the changes in environments, fantastic. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3561.44s)]
*  I mean, obviously, Lord of the Rings is an amazing management book, if you will. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3566.96s)]
*  Like the way Gandalf shows up in just the right time and has the exact right combination of [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3569.6s)]
*  words is certainly something that's extremely valuable. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3577.28s)]
*  At least it conforms to the best version of the systems that we used to build. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3582.88s)]
*  And I think that's really valuable. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3588.48s)]
*  I think Seeing Like a State is just a fantastic book. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3592.08s)]
*  He just passed away. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3597.52s)]
*  You probably saw that on Twitter. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3598.4s)]
*  It's yesterday or so, a couple days ago. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3600.1600000000003s)]
*  What a fantastic mind. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3603.6800000000003s)]
*  And I know it's one of those books you read which feels like it should be a book [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3604.88s)]
*  as particularly good book in a space of lots of books, but it seems like totally like that. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3613.44s)]
*  There seems to be nothing around it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3617.04s)]
*  It's just like, I think people ask me, oh, recommend to me other books like Seeing Like a State, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3618.32s)]
*  and I'm not sure what to say. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3623.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3624.96s)]
*  There's nothing quite like it. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3625.36s)]
*  It's really wonderful. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3626.88s)]
*  I've been fascinated with the Burnham books. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3629.6s)]
*  You mean Manitourial Revolution? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3634.0s)]
*  And Machiavellians are just like, especially for when they were written incredible books. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3635.84s)]
*  And just the degree by which we have known a lot of these kind of things, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3639.68s)]
*  but haven't known the solution to some of the things that Burnham discusses are just remarkable. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3644.48s)]
*  I think the best book I've read was Conflict of Visions recently by Thomas Sowell. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3651.44s)]
*  I just find that is an incredibly insightful book by creating a prior to a lot of political [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3658.56s)]
*  conversations, like a higher order differentiation between people. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3665.68s)]
*  I've just found myself to be very much a someone who I just, I fundamentally think humans are [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3671.52s)]
*  limited and that's the best thing about humans. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3678.48s)]
*  And that systems that we can build can lead us to incredibly amazing feats of cooperation, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3681.2799999999997s)]
*  coordination, and like optimizing everything you do to find the best set of trade-offs feels like [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3689.04s)]
*  an extremely mature way of seeing the world. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3694.88s)]
*  And I'm just constantly fascinated with like Sowell's writing. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3697.92s)]
*  Final question. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3706.4s)]
*  What is it you hope to learn next? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3707.28s)]
*  I have been on a wonderful sort of reconnecting with engineering kick for a while. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3711.36s)]
*  I've really, really had a great time coming back. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3718.6400000000003s)]
*  I think co-pilots and AI has allowed me to like mitigate all the downsides of just not spending [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3722.4s)]
*  any weekends and work on computing projects. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3730.4s)]
*  Again, I'm incredibly interested in LLM's Transformer, the machine learning world. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3734.08s)]
*  And it feels like an almost unending well of lack of information and progress. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3740.96s)]
*  So I'm just like, I'm fairly tapped on this. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3748.64s)]
*  It's hard to see this as a field because it just like changes every couple of days. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3754.0s)]
*  I am most thinking about, and I really feel like I can contribute a little bit to [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3759.52s)]
*  just thinking about how to have higher trust companies at scale. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3767.12s)]
*  I just think people like that people make a lot of people describe as I'm a small company person, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3769.7599999999998s)]
*  a big company person. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3776.72s)]
*  And I just don't think what's actually the differences. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3777.6s)]
*  I think people are using labels around something they feel and they haven't got the right words. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3779.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's probably many things that contribute to this. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3786.16s)]
*  But certainly parts of these things are a sense of agency and ability to impact and ability to [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3789.04s)]
*  not have like a lot of what happens in companies is that policies and [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3798.8799999999997s)]
*  processes, they're well-meaning. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3807.12s)]
*  They bring up the floor so no one actually does something really, really wrong. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3809.3599999999997s)]
*  But what people don't see is they also bring down the ceiling. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3813.12s)]
*  And so you end up in these places where it doesn't matter who you are, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3815.8399999999997s)]
*  you're going to do seven out of 10 work. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3820.72s)]
*  And just the whole concept of entrepreneurship is about going for world class. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3822.48s)]
*  And people need to leave in many places after a company gets to a certain size. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3828.3199999999997s)]
*  I really think this is simply a path dependent, unacknowledged situation that just comes from [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3833.12s)]
*  the way we have like the tools that we had to coordinate in people. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3839.92s)]
*  And everyone sort of holds their dismissal of trust as a part of this. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3847.36s)]
*  I think the best areas of a company like Shopify keep the ceiling open so that everyone can reach [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3851.76s)]
*  as high as they have ambition for. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3860.8s)]
*  Sometimes teams come together and just do absolute work class. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3863.92s)]
*  That means you have to be willing to accept underperformance as well. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3868.0800000000004s)]
*  Like the floor can't be quite so high. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3872.2400000000002s)]
*  So sometimes you get somebody to come chip. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3874.0s)]
*  Sometimes you get something in the wrong way. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3875.76s)]
*  This all comes with a territory. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3878.4s)]
*  And businesses tend to think about these things as disastrous events [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3880.0800000000004s)]
*  and they'll do everything to not experience this and therefore stem all creativity. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3883.28s)]
*  I think we are now gaining tools and approaches that can do this at scale. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3890.48s)]
*  I think just like what the engineers experience with writing code and then you have a co-pilot [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3899.84s)]
*  that helps you write code well given what you're working on and quickly gain the insights [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3907.76s)]
*  that you need and the task that they're understanding. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3914.08s)]
*  Then after you are done with it, there's automated systems for tests. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3917.52s)]
*  There's automated linting, automated unit tests and so on. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3921.2799999999997s)]
*  I know this sounds incredibly nerdy, but what this basically is, is trusts plus co-pilot [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3928.64s)]
*  and automated verify. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3935.44s)]
*  But all trust and verify thing. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3938.64s)]
*  I think that creates a wonderfully fun environment. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfDLSbTJCik&t=3941.44s)]
