# Neal Stephenson Future Predictor  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9_7nETAx18)
*  You seem to be better at predicting the future than almost anyone else, and you've done this in a wide variety of areas.
*  What's your self-awareness as to how this has been possible?
*  I think there's kind of a scattershot phenomenon going on where a science fiction book might include a large number of hypothetical inventions.
*  And the ones that are in there might be described somewhat vaguely.
*  A bunch of those might never get realized.
*  People very generously tend to forget about those.
*  They give the writer, the novelist, a free pass, and they only take into account the ones that seem to have come true.
*  There's also some generosity there in that the description of the invention might be a little wishy washy, a little vague.
*  But then later on, when a somewhat similar real invention gets made, someone's nice enough to say that the science fiction writer invented this.
