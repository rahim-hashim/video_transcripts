# Drunk history makers?  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJSSdSiSicE)
*  I think in general that history is often quite contingent on very flawed human beings.
*  There's a good Matt Iglesias post about this in the context of decisions about whether
*  people run for president or not from Joe Biden deciding to step down to like Teddy Roosevelt
*  and things like that.
*  And when you kind of do have some access to really smart people and kind of the halls
*  of power, I mean, people are often kind of winging it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They're making big decisions with limited information.
*  And no second chances, really?
*  Often no second chances.
*  You know, I do think that people who are risk taking tend to prevail for various reasons,
*  right?
*  Because they are the people on the right tail of the graph.
*  You know, I think kind of financial risk taking probably has some positive correlation with
*  risk taking as far as substance use.
*  Not that high, but maybe like point two or point three or something like that, right?
*  So yeah, it wouldn't surprise me if more important decisions than we think in the history of
*  the world have made in various states of intoxication.
