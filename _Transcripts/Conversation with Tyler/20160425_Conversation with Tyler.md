# Camille Paglia on Her Lifestyle of Observation and Lamb Vindaloo  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 25, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSRuncwwJyQ)
*  Camille has written the very best essays ever on Edmund Spencer, Alice in Wonderland, and
*  the Marquis de Sade.
*  She understands Bob Dylan and Susan Sontag.
*  And she has pursued a career of great integrity.
*  That's my introduction for Camille.
*  I'd like to start with a question from a reader.
*  I'll ask readers for questions.
*  How do you feel about the fact that Silicon Valley dominates our economy and culture?
*  Is there any tech guru you're interested in?
*  Well, no.
*  My last big tech guru was probably Marshall McLuhan.
*  He had a prophetic insight into what was about to happen.
*  He's kind of the patron saint of my working on the web from the very first issue of Salon
*  in 1995 when it's hard to believe the web still wasn't taken seriously by already established
*  journalists.
*  There was a major political reporter at the Boston Globe, for example, who tried to pressure
*  me not to write for the web.
*  He said, oh, no one takes the web seriously.
*  And an enormous thing has happened, which of course has also sucked in a whole generation
*  of young people, alas, that's all they know.
*  So I think we're kind of on the downside of that right now.
*  Take your last book, Glittering Images, and your other work, which emphasized the role
*  of the iconic and Western and Eastern culture, the role of the spectacular, vivid visual,
*  life-giving spectacular events.
*  And now here we have people, they look, they listen on very small smartphones.
*  Is this culture dead?
*  But if the culture was so splendid, why did people give it up so quickly?
*  Well, the reason I wrote Glittering Images is because I felt that there's an avalanche
*  of fragmented visual impressions, disconnected, glaring, tacky, badly designed, that young
*  people are growing up in.
*  I think it really is true that children's brains are being reshaped and that in its
*  standard forms for logic and for sequential information and for reasoning, everything's
*  disappearing.
*  So I tried to write a book where people would just stare at an image for a certain length
*  of time.
*  I think it's getting worse and worse.
*  Web design, which my school, the University of the Arts, teaches and so on, I think web
*  design is in the pits.
*  I thought web design was moving into, becoming a major genre of the arts.
*  I think we're in a kind of swirling vortex.
*  And yes, what you mention about the miniaturization of image, it's terrible.
*  I was raised in a time, 1950s, when Hollywood was competing with television by doing something
*  which television couldn't do, those gigantic screens, like the Ten Commandments, there's
*  like a giant thing of Pharaoh, giant sculpture, starts at one end of the screen and you watch
*  it go to the other end of the screen.
*  It's phenomenal.
*  Lawrence of Arabia, oh my God, the dunes of Lawrence of Arabia with that music.
*  And so there's no sense of the large.
*  The young people have no sense, whatever, of the expansive, of the big gesture.
*  And did we maybe overrate the large?
*  If the large gave through so quickly, so readily to what you're describing as this kind of
*  mediocrity, what was wrong with that culture of the 50s, 60s and 70s to begin with?
*  I would say that a culture always moves in cycles.
*  So you have periods that esteem the colossal, like the Bernini Renaissance and Baroque periods,
*  and then you get the small, the art of the small, like the Rococo is a kind of evanescence
*  and an evaporation of the big Baroque swirls and all of a sudden it's like little tiny
*  things like on a Valentine's card.
*  So I think we go back and forth.
*  I just feel lucky, I think, that I have a kind of epic imagination because I was raised
*  watching the Ten Commandments and Ben Hur, oh my God, Ben Hur, I could watch that 200
*  times.
*  It's one of your ten favorite movies, right?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the one on the list that surprised me.
*  It is, right?
*  But given what you're saying.
*  And the music, and the music composed for those things, it directly inspired my writing
*  of Sexual Personae.
*  Absolutely, I'm directly inspired by music.
*  But I think for women it's good to have something that's going to make you like assert and trample
*  and conquer.
*  It animates me.
*  These are my maxims.
*  Do you today consider yourself a cultural conservative?
*  No, not at all.
*  Why not?
*  No, because...
*  Everything used to be better.
*  Isn't that odd?
*  No, we're in a period of decadence, of falling off, you see.
*  No, conservative would mean that I would be cleaving to something past, which was great
*  and no longer is.
*  That would be saying we need to return to that.
*  Usually I'm not saying we need to return to anything.
*  I do believe we're moving inexorably into the future.
*  There's a momentum to that.
*  I'm a libertarian.
*  That's why I'm always freely offending both sides.
*  Liberal, conservative, and I'm a Democrat even though I'm constantly criticizing...
*  I think a true intellectual should be always beyond partisanship.
*  And always criticizing.
*  Always criticizing.
*  Yes, and always critiquing the premises of your own friends and allies.
*  In the back, we were talking about Brazil.
*  You mentioned you'd been there nine times.
*  Yes, nine or ten.
*  What does Brazilian culture have which North American culture lacks?
*  What's the draw?
*  It's such a polyglot of cultures and ethnicities.
*  But beyond that, Brazilians understood my work from the first moment I began to publish.
*  What they understood was artifice, art, a carnival for them, and costuming, and masquerade,
*  and that kind of baroque exuberance, and the syncretism of Christianity with the Yoruba
*  cult of West Africa in Salvador de Bahia.
*  They understood my vision of art and beauty.
*  Beauty is an incredibly important human principle rather than the way it was being trashed by
*  my fellow feminists at that time.
*  They also understand nature, the grandeur of nature, the power of nature.
*  They want something much larger.
*  Yes, instead of these silly little arguments that climate change is causing the end of
*  the world.
*  Oh my God.
*  Anyone who talks like that does not understand the grandeur and the power of nature.
*  And to imagine that we can make a change in it is absolutely absurd.
*  What's your theory of modernity that puts them on one part of the curve and we're on
*  another more decadent part of the curve?
*  What's the difference?
*  What's what we would call the structural equilibrium as economists if I dare invoke such a thing?
*  Well, Brazil is in its own world.
*  It's not been part of the world wars.
*  It doesn't have this huge militaristic superstructure.
*  It doesn't have a messianic view of itself politically.
*  The politics are always chaos and drama, like in a grand opera.
*  It's like another planet, really, Brazil.
*  To continue the whirlwind tour of Camille Paglia, you wrote in Glittering Images that
*  George Lucas was perhaps or maybe definitely the greatest artist of our time.
*  I do not disagree with that, but now that you've written that, The Force Awakens has
*  come out.
*  Which is not George Lucas.
*  It's Disney, who is not the greatest artist of our time.
*  It has nothing to do with George Lucas.
*  I haven't seen it.
*  I wouldn't dream of it.
*  When it's on TV, I'll look at it.
*  Please.
*  Do you think I want to sit in the theater and be tortured?
*  By the contamination of my ideals?
*  I'm not going to do that.
*  No, I'm just...
*  You've spoken very highly of the prequels, which many people don't like at all.
*  Yes.
*  What is it that people don't get about the prequels?
*  They say Jar Jar Binks and they scream.
*  Oh, I know exactly what they're talking about.
*  Tell us what's good about the prequels.
*  No, it was Revenge of the Sith.
*  After the great volcano planet climax of Revenge of the Sith, I think it's one of the greatest
*  sequences in all of modern art.
*  The thing is, once I had written about it, I realized as I went out into the world how
*  few people had actually seen the movie because people had given up on the prequels long before.
*  Therefore, I think anyone who dismisses what I say about the sublime quality of the vision,
*  the execution, and the emotion, the passions of that scene, really, they don't know what
*  I'm talking about because they haven't exposed themselves to it.
*  Music.
*  Rolling Stones.
*  Yes.
*  They're the two albums.
*  Hot Rocks, more Hot Rocks.
*  Now, you wrote about the Rolling Stones some time ago, but if I look at the career of the
*  Stones, and they have a new album coming out this year, I find it striking that they've
*  kept on going.
*  I actually count that as a mark against them.
*  I still think they're good, but when I go back and listen, I never hear new things in
*  their music.
*  Now that some time has passed, what would you say about the Rolling Stones?
*  Do you agree that you're a little disappointed with them?
*  Well, I haven't been following them for many, many years.
*  To me, the Rolling Stones were a revolution when they happened, in that period when the
*  Beatles were all upbeat, and here come these surly guys sneering, spitting, and so on and
*  so on.
*  The Beatles were dark and subtle, too, right?
*  Well, not like the Stones.
*  Here's the difference, is that the Rolling Stones are inspired by, animated by, to this
*  day, by the blues, by the blues tradition.
*  The Beatles really were more almost Broadway and musical comedy.
*  British musical.
*  British musical and Tin Pan Alley and so on.
*  They were tremendous song smiths, but there's nothing dark about them.
*  In other words, you're not getting ... Paul McCartney is a wonderful bass player, but
*  you're not getting the big, roaring sound of Bill Wyman's bass at the beginning of the
*  Stones' career.
*  I really have not been following the Stones.
*  Ever since Bill Wyman left the Stones, I have not felt that that's with the Stones I knew.
*  I'm delighted that they go on and that they perform and so on, but I have absolutely no
*  interest in exposing myself to those horrible arena conditions for music.
*  It's like, it's happening to people like, oh my goodness, just the light shows and the
*  this and the that.
*  This is not, this is not a, you know, they're not musical experiences.
*  They're social experiences now.
*  So what's the music from classic rock that when you listen to it today, every single
*  time you hear more in it?
*  Like I would say, Brian Wilson and Jimi Hendrix.
*  Every time I hear them, it sounds different and fresher.
*  For me.
*  What are your picks?
*  Well, Jimi Hendrix is one of the great geniuses of any instrument in the last hundred years.
*  Obviously, his music has lasted, it's still fresh and so on.
*  For me, there's a whole period there.
*  I teach him my art of song lyrics course.
*  I just was doing, like Crosby's stills and Nash, doing wooden ships and it still has
*  this incredible power.
*  I love that the entire period of the 1960s, the music, I think.
*  It was a kind of magic moment.
*  And then still in the 70s, Led Zeppelin, you know, when the levee breaks, this was enormous
*  power.
*  A lot of that music that Jimi Page was doing, a lot of it working in the studio actually.
*  It wasn't just live music.
*  So fast forward back to the present.
*  Who would be a musical artist today?
*  I know you've written Taylor Swift as a pestilence, so it's probably not her.
*  Taylor Swift is like a nightmare.
*  But who would be a musical artist today who stands up to the giants of the past?
*  Who stands up to working today?
*  Working today or close to today?
*  The last 10 years.
*  I was enjoying, I was really very hopeful about Rihanna for a while there.
*  But unfortunately, I think that she's not really working with the top producers any
*  longer and the new album is an atrocity.
*  It's really terrible.
*  It's sad because there are so many people with talents who are not being developed.
*  It's because our music industry is now very formulaic.
*  Some people can't really move along studying their instruments and getting their chops
*  over a period of time.
*  There's nothing to draw on in the way that the musicians of my generation could draw
*  on the folk tradition, the folk music.
*  You're sounding like a cultural conservative.
*  I'm just saying there are certain moments, certain magic moments of fertility or creativity
*  that happen in many of the arts.
*  You can find certain key moments where there's a confluence of influences and a certain richness.
*  In that very moment, it's a great time to be alive, to be young.
*  For example, Shakespeare would not be Shakespeare if he were alive today.
*  As it happens, he left Stratford for whatever reason, went to London at a magic moment when
*  theater was flourishing, which was only for a few decades and then it was out again.
*  There's a certain kind of luck.
*  If you're the right person at the right time in any one of the artists.
*  Every album is different.
*  He draws upon a lot of sources from the past.
*  Inspired by rap.
*  The bloat.
*  Rhythm and blues, no?
*  What can I say?
*  Okay, I understand.
*  Education, some questions about education.
*  There's a new model, a school called Minerva, where you take four years.
*  You spend each of the four years in a foreign country, one year in Buenos Aires, one in
*  Istanbul, one in Bangalore, I think.
*  You work in small classes, but the classes are all online.
*  There's no library.
*  There's no formal campus per se.
*  It's been around for about two years.
*  What do you think?
*  What's your prediction?
*  Well, I think the idea of sending young people abroad is great.
*  I think that is a proper use of the money that's going down the tubes at the major
*  universities right now.
*  For parents to think, it would profit young people a lot to be exposed to the world.
*  Right now, our primary school education is absolutely appalling in its lack of world
*  history and world geography.
*  I know because I get everyone in my classroom.
*  I'm lucky I teach at a kind of school where I'm getting students from a wide range of
*  preparations.
*  There might be a couple of private school people, but people from the inner city, from
*  good schools, from bad schools.
*  I really have a very clear sense after four years of teaching what's going on at the primary
*  school level.
*  It is unbelievable how little they know.
*  It's absolutely shocking how little they know.
*  This is a recipe for a disaster.
*  I say, yes, send them abroad.
*  This other thing of the online thing.
*  I don't believe this online thing at all.
*  I think that you need the live person.
*  You need a live person who can talk extemporaneously and respond to the moment.
*  Not just people who are reading the same old damn lecture over and over again.
*  Also the kind of formulaic teaching that goes on in the Ivy League.
*  Also the kind of teaching that goes on in the Ivy League where there's all flattering.
*  There's these small seminar things.
*  The A-minus seminar, right?
*  There's all this practice in learning how to talk in this slightly pretentious way about
*  things and impressing each other.
*  So what?
*  They're all packaging them for the bourgeoisie.
*  Send them to Brazil, right?
*  God.
*  They're so proud of themselves.
*  They produce all these clones.
*  These polished bourgeois clones.
*  Witless, knowing nothing.
*  Speaking of inspiring teachers, what's your favorite Harold Bloom story?
*  My favorite.
*  You mean personal story?
*  Personal story.
*  Well, I don't know about favorite, but if you want to know the story.
*  The story.
*  Here's the story.
*  All right.
*  So I never took a course with Harold Bloom.
*  I was in graduate school at Yale.
*  I just never took a course with him.
*  I didn't know him at all.
*  Then he heard ... The only time I encountered him ... Uh-oh.
*  This is going ... I shouldn't say this.
*  Okay, maybe.
*  But anyway, let's say he would come according.
*  I would see him turning up at a door.
*  Hello, hello, hello.
*  Okay, that's all.
*  I just knew him to say hello to.
*  So then he heard what I was going to be working on.
*  I was having trouble finding a dissertation director for a study of androgyny in literature
*  and art.
*  It's a time when nobody was doing ... It's hard to believe now.
*  Because everything is sex and gender everywhere.
*  But at the time, no one was doing a dissertation on sex at the Yale graduate school.
*  It's hard to believe.
*  So he summoned me to his office.
*  This is really how we met.
*  He said, my dear, I am the only one who can direct that dissertation.
*  I said, okay.
*  So that was it.
*  So then he understood everything.
*  He understood everything I wanted to do with the book.
*  He understood my ideas.
*  He was a fantastic resource for me insofar as he also supported me or gave me confidence
*  throughout all those decades when I couldn't get it published.
*  My sexual persona was rejected by seven publishers and five agents.
*  By the time it was published, I was 43 years old.
*  I'm like a great role model for people to soldier through adversity and rejection and
*  just continue to develop the craft and eventually, hopefully, one will see one's work in print.
*  What did he think of you and sexual persona?
*  He always said I gave him great nages.
*  Which is sort of like the other way around.
*  Which is sort of like to have a father to a daughter, et cetera.
*  But he and I agree about Freud.
*  We have a Freudian psycho history and so on.
*  There's a segment of all of these conversations.
*  In the middle, it's called underrated or overrated.
*  I mentioned something and you tell me if you think it's underrated or overrated by our
*  society.
*  By our society or by me?
*  Your opinion relative to the society.
*  Don't hold back on these.
*  Tell us what you think.
*  First one, economics.
*  Economics as a field?
*  As a field.
*  Overrated or underrated?
*  Probably underrated.
*  Why?
*  I don't know.
*  I just think that economists sort of are kind of figures of fun sometimes in cartoons.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just judging by what I sense.
*  William Faulkner.
*  Oh, he's totally gone, poor man.
*  Okay.
*  I actually have been commenting on this recently to my friends.
*  Do you remember that period when Faulkner was everywhere and everyone read him and he
*  was just a baseline figure?
*  Then thanks to Kate Millett and all these Philistine feminist types, in the early 70s
*  there was a great sweeping away of many, many major male figures in the history of literature
*  including Ernest Hemingway, D.H.
*  Lawrence, who had a huge influence on me.
*  If you're a resident of Mississippi, Faulkner still lives and is vivid.
*  I think outside of that, it's been years since I've heard Faulkner mentioned.
*  You're saying underrated.
*  Well, I think he should be on the reading list.
*  I don't know.
*  Perhaps he was overrated in our time, but he certainly was a major author and a major
*  influence in American literature, for heaven's sakes.
*  But young people aren't reading him and they aren't reading many of the great writers.
*  Yoko Ono, overrated or underrated.
*  Oh, Yoko Ono.
*  Oh, don't start me on Yoko Ono.
*  One of my least favorite people in the universe.
*  Yes, I blame her for the break of the Beavis.
*  Do you know that screechy yodeling that went on?
*  Oh my God, she's a horror.
*  But I gave her her due in Glittering Images because she was a very important figure in
*  the development of conceptual art.
*  She really was very innovative in the 1960s.
*  Oh, what a dreary, humorless person.
*  When I think of a lot of your books, and especially if I contrast you to Marxist criticism, I
*  think of your emphasis as being a lot of metaphysics in a very exciting, big picture way.
*  So let's say we take a writer, very high quality, but she moves very far from metaphysics.
*  She writes stories about small numbers of people in rural Ontario.
*  Alice Monroe.
*  Oh, I don't read fiction.
*  I don't read contemporary fiction.
*  I have absolutely zero interest in contemporary fiction.
*  The last contemporary fiction I have any interest in is Auntie Mame, and I'm not kidding.
*  I like plays like Tennessee Williams.
*  No, the fiction writers are off in another world.
*  They don't see the world as it exists now.
*  They don't use the language of the contemporary world.
*  Their English is utterly stale and cloistered.
*  I cannot read a page of contemporary fiction.
*  Anything that is pre-contemporary fiction, I'm a great admirer of.
*  Believe me, these are the kind of books I like.
*  I'll open like this, and like that.
*  You're going to pass on Harry Potter too?
*  Harry Potter, no, I don't.
*  In fact, I refused to write on Harry Potter for the Wall Street Journal once, and they
*  said, oh, who should we ask next?
*  Harold Bloom.
*  Harold Bloom became known for it.
*  He got that because of me.
*  Just like Norman Mailer got to interview Madonna for the cover of Esquire, because Madonna
*  said no to me.
*  People kind of trying to bring us together.
*  HBO wanted to do a My Dinner at Andre type thing with Madonna and me.
*  She's just like afraid.
*  I think she thought I was going to be some big intellectual, but it's not true.
*  Parenthood, overrated or underrated?
*  Who?
*  Parenthood.
*  Parenthood?
*  Oh, no.
*  I don't have anything to do with that.
*  No.
*  Okay.
*  The most underrated?
*  I don't watch, I don't watch, no.
*  No, not the show Parenthood.
*  The thing Parenthood.
*  Oh, Parenthood.
*  Being a parent.
*  Oh, oh, that was a big switch.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's what he's overrated.
*  Good Lord.
*  I mean, we need a warning sign for a U-turn.
*  Okay, all right, go ahead.
*  Parenthood, overrated or underrated?
*  Parenthood.
*  Parenthood.
*  Well, okay, I mean, obviously we're in a time now where parenting is in crisis, I would
*  think.
*  I mean, I think that it is a, I mean, the reason we have all these whiny, you know,
*  super sensitive girls on campus that will run shrieking, okay, you know, that's the
*  slightest thing that offends their ears or drag mattresses, you know, onto the stage
*  at commencement exercises.
*  The reason we have that is because the parents have not prepared them, okay, for real life.
*  So, you know, in other words, they've been raised in this bourgeois, you know, pampered
*  cocoon.
*  So I think there's been a tremendous failure of parenting, certainly, okay, in terms of
*  young people being ready to take on the real world in their late teens.
*  What's the most underrated play by William Shakespeare?
*  The most underrated play?
*  Yes.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I really can't answer that.
*  I'm teaching my Shakespeare course this semester.
*  I simply focus on the really major plays.
*  So I don't, I don't, there's no, so I don't know.
*  I mean, perhaps Antony and Cleopatra is like, is starting to recede.
*  I don't know why.
*  I think Antony and Cleopatra was a great favorite of my generation of, of, you know, of the
*  60s generation.
*  But for some reason it's becoming, I think, marginal.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Maybe it's because it's about imperialism.
*  May I ask a few questions about sex?
*  Of course.
*  You've covered this topic before.
*  The audience will, will demand it.
*  Yeah.
*  Which country comes closest to your vision of having healthy relations between the sexes
*  or among the sexes, which may be a better way to put it?
*  Well, I would say that, you know, that Brazil has the, has the healthiest view of sexuality.
*  But I, I wouldn't say that the sexes are particularly getting along in, in the upper middle class
*  in, in Brazil as I meet professional women journalists and so on there.
*  I mean, I think that, I think that the, the women are magnificent.
*  They're, they're incredible the way they look and dress and they have such style and, and
*  assertiveness and so on.
*  But I'm not sure the communications with, with men are particularly, you know, successful
*  right now.
*  There's a lot of static there.
*  And the men look kind of, the men are like gnomes, you know.
*  It's strange.
*  They don't have this thing like in the United States, usually at the upper, upper middle
*  class, you know, successful careers and so on.
*  You'll have the women doing their Pilates and the men will be going to the gym also.
*  And, and, but not in Brazil, okay.
*  The men just seem to sag and get plumber and plumber and duller and duller and lose their
*  hair.
*  And nobody minds, okay.
*  I think because they, they assume that the, that woman rules.
*  It's like a woman is like, you know, the cock of the walk down there.
*  It's like, it's, I'm still trying to figure it out.
*  But anyway, I love it.
*  I adore it.
*  I mean, I love Brazilian women.
*  Okay.
*  They're, they're, they're so bossy.
*  Okay.
*  Thanks.
*  We've now had gay men in the military for some time.
*  Yeah.
*  Out openly, legally.
*  Yeah.
*  Permissible.
*  How that has run.
*  Has it surprised you?
*  Because earlier you wrote, you expected it could be quite disruptive and it hasn't been.
*  In a sense, has male gay culture turned out to be tamer than what you expected in the
*  early 90s?
*  Tamer?
*  Tamer.
*  More domestic, more people adopting children, more people settling down.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Well, it's changed.
*  Well, it's changed.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  I mean, I think that, you know, that the, you know, AIDS was like a holocaust, okay,
*  and the number of interesting, fascinating, talented men, of artists and people who were
*  just, you know, in fashion and just every, every level.
*  I mean, I think that in many ways, gay culture is sort of still recovering from that.
*  We're in a kind of like, I don't know, kind of holding pattern.
*  I think after the, there was a great, enormous kind of flamboyance and assertiveness to gay
*  male culture once.
*  It had a distinct style and voice of its own.
*  And so what you're saying, well, things are turning out better.
*  Well, yes, there's an assimilation going on, okay, but also to me, a kind of disappearance
*  of that gay aesthetic that was, so I mean, Oscar Wilde is one of the, you know, the major
*  influences on my thinking remains that.
*  I teach a whole course on Oscar Wilde.
*  And now what can you say?
*  I mean, is there, you know, is there anything distinctly gay right now except, you know,
*  there are certainly gay activists are extremely successful, okay, in terms of pushing their
*  agenda and, you know, and so on.
*  I mean, that's probably these little cadres of gay activists are the only thing that's
*  left.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, I, you know, I mean, I think assimilation is always a loss.
*  I mean, certainly my culture experienced it.
*  And American culture is like kind of vanished too.
*  For America, what should an ideal of masculinity look like now?
*  What it should, what should it look like?
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I mean, I think.
*  The older generation, you would have like a Cary Grant or a Rock Hudson, right?
*  You would see the movie Philadelphia Story, one of your favorites.
*  There was some ideal of masculinity on the screen, maybe not your ideal, but today, what
*  is it that's out there which comes closest to your ideal?
*  Well, you know, many of those images on the screen which seem to be masculine, often the
*  actual actors were gay, okay, you know, like Rock Hudson and Cary Grant's sexuality remains
*  one of the great mysteries.
*  I mean, a lot of things.
*  I mean, I adore Cary Grant.
*  Oh my God.
*  But he's like a hallucination.
*  All of the great images, you know, on the screen are hallucinations.
*  You know, I mean, Kim Novak in Vertigo is literally a hallucination.
*  But what should be the ideal?
*  You know, the problem right now is that the masculine has no honor, whatever, in our culture.
*  We're in a period now where young people are being processed with universities and the
*  gender norms are said to be that gender is a construct.
*  It is simply the product of environmental pressures on people.
*  There's nothing in the body.
*  We have a big culture.
*  Not everyone goes to university, thank goodness.
*  You can go to a NASCAR race and a few of the people there have not been to the Ivy
*  Leagues.
*  Working class culture retains an idea of the masculine.
*  There's absolutely no doubt about that.
*  There's a vitality.
*  But with that comes static.
*  So you have to have strong women in order to deal with masculine men.
*  And so that is why masculinity is constantly being eroded and diminished and dissolved
*  on university campuses because it allows women to be weak.
*  If you have weak men, then you can have weak women.
*  And that's what we have.
*  Our university system is anything that is remotely masculine is identified as toxic,
*  as intrinsic to rape culture.
*  A utopian future is imagined when there are no men.
*  We're all genderless mannequins.
*  The movie of the time machine is like one of, we're moving toward that, the Eloi.
*  That's how I see the upper middle class graduates of the Ivy League.
*  They're the Eloi.
*  They're completely bland.
*  They have no ideas.
*  They all get along very well with each other because they're nothing.
*  And they're eating their fruits, which are given to them by the Morlocks who come, or
*  the industrial class.
*  So that's how I see the future.
*  Unfortunately, I began my career talking about androgyny and talking about the imaginative
*  complexity of androgyny and how the orators and the shaman and the prophet have this androgynous
*  component.
*  Today's androgyny is just boring.
*  David Bowie at his height, absolutely brilliant, electrifying, kabuki, you gotta go on and
*  on and so on.
*  And all these palad androgyny of today, there's nothing creative about them, whatever.
*  But just to try to cheer you up a bit, what then is the healthiest segment of American
*  society?
*  Because again, you've lived most of your life in the Northeast, mostly in colleges and universities.
*  Yes.
*  So think outside the box.
*  Where do you see vitality, both culturally, sexually, in terms of aesthetics?
*  No, I mean, I don't.
*  I think it's been a tremendous flattening.
*  I think there's very little culturally that, right now, there's very little of substance
*  or interest being produced in art and culture.
*  We're in a kind of retro period.
*  We're kind of chopping up everything, putting everything from the past through the grinder
*  again.
*  How about Canada, overrated or underrated?
*  Or do they just have all the same problems?
*  Well, Canada, they have this ideal of the consensus.
*  And that's why when I go up there, people have said to me actually, quietly, oh, I love
*  having you here.
*  Everyone's always forcing us to have consensus in Canada.
*  And I've been told that also when I go to Norway.
*  People say, oh, we can't stand it.
*  We're not allowed to have an opinion in Norway.
*  We all have to have a consensus.
*  Canada, everyone is very civilized in Canada.
*  But it's impossible to rise above the herd also.
*  You can't make any big gestures.
*  You're thought to be antisocial.
*  So I wouldn't glorify Canada.
*  Let me ask you a few questions about yourself.
*  There's a wonderful four-page essay you wrote called The Artistic Dynamics of Revival, where
*  you talked about how creators have early, middle, and late periods.
*  Beethoven is maybe the most obvious example, but there are many, many others.
*  When you think of your own career, how do you see it as fitting together in terms of
*  like a time arc and what you've done, what you want to do?
*  What are your early, middle, and late periods?
*  Where are you in it now?
*  My early period was total failure, flop, and in the middle of it, you get published.
*  There was that.
*  Then all of a sudden, I burst out like a jack-in-the-box.
*  It's been like blabber, blabber, blabber ever since.
*  I really don't see phases.
*  I just see nothingness and then everything.
*  It's sort of like a carnival.
*  What will the late period look like?
*  The late period?
*  Okay.
*  We haven't gotten to it yet.
*  So the everything is the middle period.
*  Right now, I'm working on something that no one has any interest in, whatever.
*  I've been working for eight years on this, my Native American explorations.
*  I'm very interested in Native American culture at the end of the Ice Age as the glacier withdrew.
*  I go around and I find little tiny artifacts and I read and so on.
*  Absolutely no one, especially anyone in Manhattan, has the slightest interest in what I'm doing.
*  I think that everything has been prepared for in my life.
*  I've been always interested in archaeology and I feel like I can make a contribution
*  even though no one is interested at all.
*  What I'm trying to do is show how the politicization of ethnic studies and racial studies and so
*  on has actually been very limiting.
*  I find very objectionable this projection, eternal projection of genocide and disaster
*  onto Native American studies.
*  I'd like to show the actual vision of Native American culture, which is religious vision,
*  metaphysical vision.
*  Cyclical approach?
*  Cyclical?
*  Relevance of nature?
*  Yes.
*  Metaphysics at the center?
*  Totally.
*  It's almost like an early animism.
*  That's why I'm interested in Salvador de Bahia also because the Yoruba cults of West Africa
*  that were absorbed into Salvador de Bahia in Brazil is the same, where all of the forces
*  of nature are perceived as spirit entities that bring you energy or vision.
*  Of the Native American cultures which have come down to us, which is different of course
*  from what you had at the Ice Age, which of those do you relate to the most and why?
*  All I'm doing is exploring the Native American cultures of the Northeast because when the
*  settlers came from Europe, the Indians were pushed out.
*  The hunting grounds were limited and then there was general destruction of Native American
*  culture for many reasons during that period.
*  We know more actually about the Plains Indians and obviously Northwestern Indians and the
*  Navajo than we do about the Northeastern Indians.
*  I believe that there are remnants.
*  I stumbled on this.
*  I'm very sorry I didn't notice this when I was living all those years in upstate New
*  York where the Andodagas still have their reservation and so on.
*  Probably the remnants of these glacial era cultures were still there as well.
*  I find it's absolutely staggering.
*  It is staggering.
*  The actual signs and remnants that are everywhere in the Northeast.
*  I could go out right now and find some dirt and I'll find you a tool, a broken tool.
*  It's absolutely incredible.
*  I feel that's what I should be doing with something like this, which no one is interested
*  in, but I feel that it's substantive and hope can help to show what was here before.
*  More about you.
*  In Vamps and Tramps you once wrote that as early as 1981 the second volume of Sexual
*  Persona was more finished, as a tricky word we know as writers, but some version is finished.
*  Do you think we will all ever have the privilege of reading it?
*  Yale Press didn't want to publish those last chapters.
*  Yale Press ended at the end of the 19th century with Emily Dickinson.
*  It was already a 700-page book.
*  I put in there the next book was coming, but then what happened of course is that throughout
*  the 90s, since the last 25 years, I've been essentially writing in articles everything
*  that I would have written in that thing.
*  All my writing on popular culture I continue to do.
*  Like on football, I had a chapter, baseball versus football, and football is the ultimate
*  pagan sport, etc.
*  I wrote Wall Street Journal, football feminism, I have a whole concept of philosophy of that,
*  and now football is getting more and more boring, it's gotten more and more technocratic,
*  so it's not in the period right now that I would celebrate, but I was celebrating that
*  tremendous period when there were still hard hits and there was still defense, and there
*  wasn't all this like throwing, fleeing the ball down the field, and like people catching
*  it, like ballerinas, please, that's not football, football is wham like that.
*  The TV won't show the great defensive plays, and so on, the whole art of defense, and the
*  great offensive defensive lines, and that kind of tussle, it's kind of gone.
*  I'm lucky, I feel lucky that I saw football on TV at its high point.
*  You also wrote that when you were in high school, you either wrote or just started a
*  book on Amelia Earhart.
*  Oh yes.
*  And what was the appeal of her to you?
*  Oh my God, okay.
*  Well Amelia Earhart, I stumbled on, it was like an article in 1961 in the Syracuse Herald
*  Journal about, there's always some article about Amelia Earhart, someone finds a fragment
*  of something, and I became very interested in her, and at that point I was like 14, and
*  so I began researching her, and in the bowels of the Syracuse Library, things were still
*  not on microfilm yet, it was like all the newspapers were still there from the 1930s.
*  So I did that for like three years on this research project, and that's how I became
*  a feminist before feminism had revived, because I suddenly discovered this period just after
*  women had won the right to vote in the 1920s and 30s, where you had all these career women,
*  like Amelia Earhart, and Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Thompson, you know, Claire Booth Luce, there's
*  just so many women, Margaret Brooke White, and so by the time second wave feminism revived,
*  which was with Betty Friedan's co-founding of now in 1967, I was out of sync with them,
*  so when suddenly they revived and began complaining about men and all that stuff and so on and
*  so forth, you know, I hated it, and there was early clashes that I had with those feminists
*  from the start, I tried to join second wave feminism, they wouldn't have me, because I
*  would not badmouth men, because these women like Amelia Earhart and so on, they did not
*  badmouth men, they admired men, they admired what men had done, and what they said was
*  we demand equal opportunity for women, which give us the opportunity to show that we can
*  achieve at the same level as men, who did all these great things, that was not the tone
*  of second wave feminism at the start, it was always like, patriarchy, like this and so
*  on, bunch of these women were insane, from the start, I went to this feminist conference
*  at the Yale Law School, when I was in graduate school, it was 1971, Kate Millett was there,
*  Rita Mae Brown, who later became a lesbian novelist and lives on a horse farm in Virginia,
*  maybe she's here, she's very rich, at any rate, so Rita Mae Brown said to me, she said,
*  the difference between you and me, Camille, is that you want to save the universities
*  and I want to burn them down, now this is, what can you say, when there's a conversation
*  stopper, I had the knock down argument with the Rolling Stones, with the New Haven Women's
*  Liberation Rock Band, I adored the Stones, they hated the Stones, so we had this huge
*  screaming argument, my back was to the wall, they were spitting in my face, and I said,
*  yes, the Rolling Stones are sexist, but they make great music, and they go, alright, let's
*  take Under My Thumb, yes, it's sexist, but it's a great song, it's a work of art, and
*  these women said to me, art, art, nothing that demeans women can be art, now that is
*  the Stalinist view of art.
*  More about you, less about that.
*  Then there was, wait a minute, then there was the argument that I had, this is about
*  the women's liberation movement, and it says, Amelia Earhart, you asked for Amelia Earhart.
*  Then I had my first job at Bennington College in 1972, and people said, oh, this is a new
*  women's studies department, one of the first ever, the state university of New York at
*  Albany, you'll be one of, so they're feminists, I'm feminist, so we had a dinner, we're going
*  to go to a lecture, and we didn't get to dessert, let me tell you about that dinner, because
*  we had this screaming argument about hormones, they denied that hormones have the slightest
*  impact on human life, they said hormones don't even exist, they told me I had been brainwashed
*  by male scientists, and these are women who are in the English department, I had a wonderful
*  education they had in biology, at any rate, Amelia Earhart never was like this with men,
*  so Amelia Earhart, in fact, my next book, my next essay lecture, I'm going to reproduce
*  the page from Newsweek magazine, 1963, I wrote in a letter to the editor, it was their number
*  one letter, I'm 16 years old at that point, and what was it, oh, I know, they put a picture
*  of Amelia Earhart there, and it was Valentina Tereshkova had become the first woman in space,
*  and the Soviet Union had sent her up, and I wrote a protest letter into Newsweek, and
*  I said that Valentina Tereshkova has become the first woman, on the anniversary that Amelia
*  Earhart flew the ocean, whatever it was, it was some big anniversary, I said, obviously,
*  Amelia Earhart's lifelong fight for equal opportunity for American women remains to
*  be won, that's 1963, Gloria Steinem can lick dirt, as far as I'm concerned, when I was
*  doing that, Gloria Steinem was running around New York in a plastic skirt, I'm telling you,
*  that's fraud, that woman, fraud.
*  You consume, absorb, experience a remarkable number and amount and diversity of cultural
*  products, music, art, architecture, interior design, fashion, whatever, right? Now, just
*  a very prosaic question, in terms of your own time management, how is it that you do
*  what you do, what is your method, so to speak, what is your diet?
*  Well, it's a lifestyle, I mean, of observation, you know, I feel that the basis of my work
*  is not only the care I take with writing, with my quality control of my prose, but also
*  my observation, it's like 24-7, I'm always observing, and I don't just sit in a university,
*  I never go to conferences, that is a terrible mistake, okay, a conference is just like overlaying
*  the same kind of insular ideology, you know, on top of it, I am always like listening
*  to conversations at the shopping mall, okay, I adore radio, the radio is fantastic, any
*  show on radio, the talk shows, political talk shows, but also the sports shows, okay, sports
*  shows are the only place that you can hear on radio actual working class voices calling
*  in, okay, for you know, what happened in the game on Monday, and what they would do
*  if they had two million dollars, and who they would hire, and so on, it's fantastic, and
*  so my writer's voice is actually very, you know, rather than these novelists, okay, with
*  their rich-a-she, you know, lingo, and so on, my actual writing voice is very influenced
*  by the way English is spoken today, okay, you know, by people, and often men, okay,
*  on radio, okay, so you get this like high-impact kind of a sound.
*  You once wrote, and I quote, my substitute for LSD was Indian food, and by that you meant
*  lamb vindaloo.
*  Yes, yes, I've been in a rut on lamb vindaloo, it's a horrible rut.
*  Tell us, it's not a horrible rut, it may be a rut.
*  It's a 40-year rut, no, it's a 40, every time I go to an Indian restaurant, I say, now I'm
*  going to try something new, but no, I must go back to the lamb vindaloo.
*  All I know is I do, it's like an ecstasy for me, the lamb vindaloo.
*  So like De Quincey, tell us, what are the effects of lamb vindaloo?
*  I don't, I can't, I don't, what can I say, I attain, you know, nirvana on this.
*  Yeah, oh no, yeah.
*  How would you describe your views on astrology?
*  A reader wrote to me, asked me to ask you this.
*  Wait, wait, you mentioned LSD, can I say something else about that?
*  Sure, LSD, please.
*  Okay, now LSD, okay, you know, I never took it, thank God, I never took drugs, I didn't believe,
*  I thought, what is this untested thing?
*  I thought, you know, like a little wine, beer, you know, all these things that have, you know,
*  thousands of years behind them, right, I said, you know, this is LSD, so I'm so glad I never took it.
*  Everyone around me was taking LSD, okay, and people who did take LSD and survived will still say things
*  like, well, I'm really glad I did, okay, because, you know, and everyone who says that, I feel
*  actually never attained the level of accomplishment that they should have in terms of whatever their vision had been.
*  I think LSD gave vision, okay, it gave vision, but then it deprived people of the ability to translate that vision,
*  okay, into material form, you know, for the present and for posterity.
*  But I still remain, you know, very oriented toward the LSD vision.
*  I mean, I feel that I almost, I feel like I took LSD because of the music, the music, you know,
*  like, you know, with Bathing at Baxter's, Jefferson Airplane, you know,
*  the first people to be using, like this, and the distortions of the birds, you know, eight miles high.
*  I adore that song and so on. I just feel I'm in that psychedelic world.
*  So I've sometimes said that what I do is psychedelic criticism because it is metaphysical and it's visionary.
*  I have a vision, I have a vision, okay, that's bigger than the society.
*  That's the problem with the Marxist approach. I believe the Marxist approach is useful, okay.
*  You know, Arnold Hauser, it's like one of the great, you know, the social history of art is one of the most influential things on me.
*  It's a Marxist perspective and indeed my work is always very attentive to the social context of anything, right.
*  But, okay, what Marxism lacks is that larger vision of the universe.
*  There are all kinds of questions and issues about human life that Marxism has no answers for.
*  It doesn't even see it, okay. It doesn't see nature, okay.
*  What kind of a vision, okay, doesn't see nature, can only see society.
*  So this is what's happening. We have all these graduates of the elite schools, okay, who have not, whereas, you know, my generation was all into, you know,
*  cosmic consciousness and we were influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism and all kinds of Eastern.
*  So that's, I feel that is the true multiculturalism. I've been arguing for that for 25 years.
*  I've been saying that if you want true multiculturalism, you have to present world cultures, okay, and the whole, including religion, okay.
*  Religion is extremely important as the most complex systems that human beings have ever devised were the great religions of the world.
*  Past Arnold Hauser, past Norman Brown, who are the contemporary writers and thinkers who influence you now who are writing serious books on either the world cultures or anything else?
*  Is there anyone left writing serious books? I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to think who has written a serious book.
*  I'm interested in right now. There's no one I would say, oh, so and so's book is coming. What? They're dead.
*  You know, the people who I admire are long dead. Unfortunately, you know, it's a terrible destruction.
*  I mean, my work looks very strange and idiosyncratic because I'm alone, okay.
*  I'm alone and all my, the people who should have been writing interesting, quirky books, as I do, are dead, okay, or their brains were destroyed in LSD, okay.
*  It's one or the other. Because I knew so many, you know, to me brilliant minds in graduate school and then early in my teaching career at Bennington College, really brilliant minds.
*  And I had great hopes for them and for what they would do. And then they couldn't get anything done. They couldn't, for whatever reason, okay, they couldn't, they didn't have the, I don't know what, they didn't have the resilience to continue against obstacles.
*  When their work would get rejected, they would become discouraged and would stop, okay. And rejection simply infuriates me, okay, and so on.
*  I say, well, I'll have my revenge on you, okay, in the afterlife, okay, and so on. I'll be around and you'll be dead. I mean, so I mean, it's an Italian thing. What can I say? Okay, you know, we-
*  This is Sexual Persona, your best known book, which I recommend to everyone if you haven't already read it.
*  For 20 years.
*  And read all of it. My favorite chapter is the Edmund Spenser chapter.
*  Really? Why? How strange.
*  That brought Spenser to life for me.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  And I realized it was a wonderful book.
*  Oh my God.
*  And I had no idea. I thought of it as old and fusty and stuffy.
*  Oh, yes.
*  And 100% because of you.
*  Well, we should tell them that the Fairy Queen is quite forgotten now, but it had enormous impact, okay, Spenser's Fairy Queen, on Shakespeare and on the romantic poets and so on and so forth.
*  And the Fairy Queen had been taught in this very moralistic way. But in my chapter, I showed that it was entirely a work of pornography, okay, equal to the Marquis de Sade.
*  Okay, so that's- and how interestingly you would be drawn to that.
*  Very interesting.
*  So the cover image is Queen Nefertiti in the Neues Museum in Berlin.
*  And recently in the news we've seen that someone has scanned the bust.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  And it will soon be possible using 3D printers to print out your own quote unquote copy of Nefertiti.
*  And how do you feel about this?
*  Oh, well. Well, you know, to me, archeology is one of my master tropes.
*  What can I say?
*  And the bust of Nefertiti discovered in 1912, and it's amazing.
*  It's barely- we've known it for like a century.
*  It's extraordinary, isn't it, how it's become such a symbol of arche.
*  And then, oh, and what you say that all the push of countries like Greece and Egypt to recover their masterpieces from where they were taken and scattered around the world.
*  I mean, I think with what's been happening with ISIS and the demolition of Palmyra and all kinds of things that have happened,
*  my attitude now is like keep Nefertiti in Berlin, please.
*  Okay, don't send it back to Cairo.
*  Of all the aesthetic judgments in your writings, you covered a lot of ground,
*  but are there any where you really fundamentally regret an earlier judgment and have revised it, not in a marginal way, which happens all the time,
*  but really just thought, well, I was wrong about that.
*  Hmm, interesting.
*  I don't know.
*  Well, I mean, my early work, I worked on for so long that I had plenty of time for second thoughts and third thoughts and hundred thoughts.
*  So, no, I mean, I can't think of anything offhand.
*  Can I get back to you about that?
*  Sure, sure.
*  If you could travel to one place you haven't been, where would it be and why?
*  I'm like Huysman's aesthetic in D'Assent.
*  I am not a great fan of traveling.
*  I just feel it's like, you know, it's become too onerous.
*  No, I'm a traveler.
*  I'm a mind traveler.
*  Okay.
*  What is your unrealized dream in life?
*  My unrealized dream to meet Catherine Duneuve.
*  But I met her once.
*  I ran into her, smack, ran into her once on Fifth Avenue in front of Saks.
*  I know this is kind of bizarre.
*  So it's a realized dream.
*  Yes, but it was odd.
*  Yes.
*  I pursued her into the glove department and forced her to sing my ticket envelope for the Fillmore East where I was seeing the Jefferson Airplane.
*  To have a conversation with Catherine Duneuve, shall we say.
*  Civilized conversation.
*  On that topic, one of your books, The Birds, about the Alfred Hitchcock movie, great book, one of my favorite movies.
*  Going back to that time, if you had the opportunity to date either Suzanne Plachette or Tippi Hedren.
*  Date? To date?
*  Date.
*  I don't date.
*  I'm just a mad nun.
*  Hypothetically, right?
*  I don't date.
*  Of course.
*  Dating is so banal.
*  T with Suzanne Plachette or Tippi Hedren.
*  Tippi Hedren invited me to lunch in Rodeo Drive after that.
*  I was, I don't know, giving some speech on Shakespeare at Los Angeles Public Library.
*  So she invited me to thank me for writing this.
*  I imagine she had a stack of 12 of these books.
*  She was the most elegant and wonderful woman.
*  I didn't have much time.
*  She invited me to go to the ranch and see all the animals and the lions she collected and so on.
*  But in Suzanne Plachette, I think, was absolutely underutilized by Hollywood.
*  What an intelligent, just knife sharp character she was.
*  In fact, I recently, in one of my salon columns, compared her to Lena Dunham is a product of exactly the same world,
*  that whole affluent art entertainment world in Manhattan.
*  I said, look what's happened to culture.
*  You want to see the difference between Suzanne Plachette, sophisticated Suzanne Plachette, and Lena Dunham.
*  You want to see the decline.
*  We're in the middle of right now. There it is.
*  Can I say a word about this?
*  Sure.
*  All right.
*  So I wrote this.
*  The British Film Institute asked me to write on a film.
*  I said, how about the birds?
*  I did.
*  So I wrote this book.
*  It was universally panned by the film journals, which said about it, this book does nothing.
*  This book does nothing.
*  By which they meant that it wasn't post-structuralist, it wasn't post-modernist, there wasn't a lot of theory.
*  I wasn't citing the male gaze, etc.
*  All this book does is go through the film, the birds, from beginning to end, scene by scene by scene,
*  and pays attention to the film itself.
*  Slowly it's made its way.
*  Here it is.
*  It was 1998 when that came out.
*  It's starting to happen now.
*  Rutledge is a publisher that's done nothing but this theory stuff.
*  They're starting to go, hmm, maybe there was something in there.
*  I'm hoping, I'm just trying to inspire graduate students to rebel against this horrible fascism
*  that forces theory onto them before they expose themselves into everything that's wonderful and imaginative in the history of literature and art.
*  I believe that paying minute attention to the actual work itself is the mission of criticism.
*  I am hopelessly old-fashioned because that's not what you're supposed to do.
*  You mentioned Foucault 59 times in one paragraph, etc.
*  Windbag that, guys.
*  I'm telling you.
*  Foucault is nothing.
*  He's nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  The reason why I know he's nothing is because he was influenced by, he pretends to be such a mastermind, but in fact he's just a collection of influences.
*  One of the biggest influences on him was Irving Goffman of Philadelphia, who was the great sociologist, originally Canadian, who wrote the presentation of self and everyday life.
*  All the things that were influenced on me influenced Foucault.
*  You have all these people thinking Foucault was some sort of innovative figure in the history of modern sociology or intellect.
*  He wasn't.
*  It is a disease in these people.
*  Everywhere, every single university in the United States, every single gender studies department, they're impregnated with Foucault.
*  That's why we have graduates who know nothing.
*  Impregnated is an interesting word to use.
*  Yes, it is.
*  Do you like Marnie, the Hitchcock movie?
*  I like Marnie, certainly.
*  I like most of Marnie.
*  It goes askew in a way the Byrds doesn't.
*  Yes.
*  There are problems with it.
*  So much was toxic going on on the set between Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren at that point.
*  There are wonderful things in Marnie.
*  If you were to take someone who had read almost all of your work and they had a sense of you and read a lot of your columns, watched some of your talks online, whatever,
*  and they had a picture of you but you wanted to tell them one thing about you that maybe they wouldn't get from any of that,
*  about what motivates you, what drives you, what your life is actually like.
*  My life is completely mundane.
*  I'm a school merm.
*  That's all I am.
*  I had the wisdom, hello, having been raised Catholic, that once I became known, finally became known at age 43, I didn't change one thing about my life.
*  Not one thing.
*  I didn't move to New York.
*  I didn't go chasing around.
*  I didn't get a speakers bureau, all that stuff.
*  I tried to keep up.
*  I guess it's all the, my cousin was a nun.
*  I have all these bishops and priests and sextons and so on in the family and so on.
*  I just try to keep to reality because I know that the basis of my work is the closeness with which I live to ordinary life.
*  I hate the elites.
*  I hate parties.
*  I don't have to book parties or anything like that.
*  And so on and so on.
*  And people, I think that people, they want success and they want material advantages and so on.
*  And they don't, it's really, being a writer is just gut work.
*  And being a teacher, and see, that's what Susan Sontag also did wrong.
*  Susan Sontag, they began in graduate school and then, oh, it's so boring, and so on.
*  She did a little teaching and then she went off and became a luminary.
*  And so she was a big luminary, a big giant dirigible luminary her whole life, like floating above the continents.
*  Here's Susan Sontag, the dirigible.
*  Woo, there she is and so on.
*  So nothing that she said made any sense actually over time, eventually.
*  And she loved to hold court at parties, as notorious.
*  So people who remember her so, she was so brilliant.
*  I saw her at this dinner party.
*  Everyone was in awe.
*  Well, people who tried to go to dinner parties to impress other people, it is such BS.
*  And so Susan Sontag over time, her work got less and less meaningful.
*  Even though people worship at the shrine of Sontag, you try to quote her on anything.
*  What can you quote her on?
*  There's nothing to quote her on.
*  The one thing you can quote her on is the thing that she wrote.
*  Quote a sentence from Susan Sontag, a great sentence.
*  You can't.
*  The only sentence was the one she regretted.
*  The white race is the cancer of history.
*  That's the one she retracted finally when she got cancer.
*  She realized how horrible that was.
*  She thought that was so horrible, now she realized.
*  And now I realize I shouldn't have said that.
*  And so on.
*  That's the only thing that you can quote her on.
*  She's not quotable because there's all this sleight of hand that she's doing.
*  She's taking material that she abowers from others or places that she's been personally at a time when downtown New York was very exciting.
*  So it basically was a kind of transcription of her everyday life.
*  I think the best thing she did probably was, for me, she wrote a very witty thing, The Imagination of Disaster.
*  I like that essay a lot, which is all about the horror films of the 1950s.
*  And I thought she only had stayed like that.
*  Kind of unpretentious and really engaging with actual materials.
*  But Susan Sontag, basically her life became going from lecture to lecture, being hailed as the great one, and being so detached from ordinary life.
*  Whereas when you're a teacher, like a classroom teacher, as I've been now for 40 years, the kids have no idea that I write books.
*  Now and then someone's father will say, she writes books.
*  And they'll come and say, my father is a fan of yours.
*  And so on.
*  Oh, really?
*  Oh, that's so nice.
*  And so on.
*  I'll say.
*  But I don't want to do it.
*  So the point is all these professors at Harvard and Princeton and Yale, they have the graduate students are paying court to them because they need letters of recommendation.
*  Hello.
*  They want something from you.
*  And so on.
*  So they're so grand.
*  And so I go in and it's like, we need more chairs.
*  What's wrong?
*  The curtain is like, I'm always in touch with the janitors.
*  And so on and so forth.
*  Infrastructure, condition of the buildings.
*  I deal with everyday life.
*  And I'm not treated like a queen.
*  I'm just like an ordinary school mom working like a horse.
*  And so on.
*  Pulling the plow.
*  Et cetera.
*  So I think that's a really good idea for writers or for is to have a job where you're dealing with constant frustrations and problems and so on.
*  I think that's really good for you.
*  Like Herman Melville, right?
*  Yes.
*  Or Wallace Stevens.
*  I kept going to the office, the insurance company and so on.
*  Every day.
*  So my last question before they get to ask you.
*  But I know there are many people in this audience or at least some who are considering some kind of life or career in the world of ideas.
*  And if you were to offer them a piece of advice based on your years struggling with the infrastructure and the number of chairs and whatever else, what would that be?
*  Get a job.
*  Have a job that's the real job.
*  Every time you have frustrations with the real job, you say this is good.
*  This is good.
*  Because this is reality.
*  This is the reality as everybody lives it.
*  And this thing of like withdrawing from the world to be a writer I think is a terrible mistake.
*  Also, number one thing is constantly observing.
*  My whole life I'm constantly jotting things down.
*  Constantly.
*  Jot, jot, jot, jot.
*  I'll have an idea.
*  I'm cooking.
*  I'll have an idea.
*  So I have a lot of pieces of paper with tomato sauce on them or whatever.
*  And I transfer these to cards or I transfer them to notes.
*  So I'm just constantly open.
*  And everything is on all the time.
*  And I never say this is important, this is not important.
*  And that's why I got into popular culture at a time when popular culture was very much.
*  In fact, there's absolutely no doubt at Yale Graduate School that I lost huge credibility with the professors
*  because of my endorsement of not only film but Hollywood.
*  When Hollywood, Hollywood was considered crass entertainment and so on.
*  And now the media studies came in very strongly after that, although highly theoretical.
*  Not the way I teach media studies.
*  But I also believe in following your own instincts and intuition.
*  There's something meaningful here.
*  You don't know what it is, but you just keep it kind of on the back burner.
*  So that's basically how I work.
*  Is this the constant observation?
*  There's nothing.
*  And also I try to tell my students, they never get the message really.
*  But what I try to say to them is that nothing is boring.
*  Nothing is boring.
*  If you're bored, you're boring.
*  All right, so I'm okay.
*  And wherever you are, it's exhausting, it's frustrating.
*  I don't know why.
*  The plane has been canceled and whatever.
*  No, after you get over your fury, you realize what opportunity is there here to absorb something more
*  from this experience, from observing other people or whatever it is.
*  I think there's really no experience that you can have.
*  There's not something in there that eventually you can't use as part of your developing system.
*  So someone who, oh, another thing I have to say, anyone interested in ideas,
*  do not read any of the current books that are considered to be like Pierre Bourdieu and all that stuff.
*  Oh my God, it's completely boring.
*  I believe in the library.
*  The library is my shrine.
*  It was my shrine when I was researching Emily Earhart.
*  When I got to Yale, the Sterling Library was my shrine.
*  I ransacked that building.
*  And that's the thing, is that I've learned more from old commentators.
*  Sir James George Fraser, the Golden Bough, which was considered completely gone
*  but had a huge impact on the Wasteland and other big works of modernism.
*  But I've learned a great deal from the commentators of the past, the historians of the past.
*  Now, when I did glittering images, the actual nullity of current scholarship became very exposed to me.
*  Of course, I already knew about it.
*  But I really got objective proof of it.
*  Each artwork that I chose, there's 29 chapters in there,
*  each artwork that I chose, I did a full research of what had been said about that particular artwork.
*  And so I began chronologically.
*  I would work, if it was an older work from the late 19th century, moving through the decades to the present.
*  And so for each of those artworks, there, you realize, oh my God, could you see it?
*  Could you see the fall in the quality of scholarship in our time?
*  From the 1980s on, I would move from these incredibly erudite and wonderful sentences
*  and just beautiful stylists about art.
*  So late 19th century, moving into the 20th century, still solid, into about the 60s.
*  And then the 70s is kind of holding it.
*  And then all of a sudden comes the 80s, 90s, 20s.
*  Oh, these people are pygmies, pygmies, the people at the elite schools.
*  And you know, let me say, there's no, the big art survey courses are being dismantled.
*  Hello. Okay.
*  It used to be you'd have a two semester course.
*  It would begin with cave art and then move in two semesters down to modernism.
*  Okay. Magnificent structure.
*  Now abandoned, you know, wholesale, except when students have protests like at Smith.
*  My sister is a graduate of Smith and was part of the protest that got the survey restored.
*  All right. But people no longer, graduate students in a hearty history and art historians
*  no longer have the ability to teach the big picture because all narratives are regarded as fictional now, imperialistic fictions.
*  Okay. So the entire story of art is not possible.
*  And therefore people know nothing.
*  I need to give them the chance to ask you questions.
*  But thank you for a fascinating discussion.
*  All right. All right. All right.
*  All right. We have two mics.
*  I will alternate mics.
*  We start here.
*  Feel free to identify yourself if you would like.
*  Hi, my name is Shana Davidson.
*  Oh, you mentioned Smith.
*  I saw you speak at Smith or Mount Holyoke in 1993.
*  Okay.
*  And it was fascinating to compare that to this because there was a great deal of booing and hissing at Smith.
*  But it was eye opening to me, you know, being kind of steeped in this.
*  I am going to wrap up being steeped in this, you know, the hegemony of the patriarchy and how we must even dress like men.
*  And you saying something to the effect of I teach in a skirt because I have more control over the classroom that way.
*  Well, I don't actually don't know.
*  I was teaching a skirt.
*  But I want to case I remember something to that question is, do you think that feminism has evolved beyond that?
*  Or is it just sort of running that same record dry?
*  Well, it was at Smith.
*  I mean, it's really shocking.
*  Yeah, when I arrived at Smith, they had they had papered the the walkway.
*  In fact, OK, as people walked in with like all these like, you know, all these hostile and uncomprehending things, people had no idea what my real ideas were.
*  They just it was just part of the whole PC thing was escalating out of control at that point.
*  But it's really it's really shocking.
*  I mean, here here's a, you know, a person, a woman, a middle aged woman at that point, I mean, my 40s who had spent 20 years writing a book that had been rejected and finally was published by Yale Press, a book on the whole history of the Western civilization.
*  And this is the treatment that I got at Smith College from one of this is one of the bastions of the Ivy League.
*  But of the Seven Sisters, you know, one of the most noble names in the history of modern women's education.
*  I mean, isn't that it shows you how ideology really is very distorting.
*  But well, feminism, you know, it's like as is going through phases.
*  I mean, I call myself a feminist.
*  Absolutely. I simply belong to a dissident wing of feminism.
*  And I think that the error made by all these people was not to understand that my wing of feminism had been suppressed and silenced at that point for 25 years.
*  Eventually we won in the 90s, the pro sex wing of feminism, thanks to Madonna, who wasn't a feminist.
*  But because of Madonna's foregrounding of sexual themes and so on, it allowed us to break through the over control by the Steinem Politburo.
*  I'll take another question, but you'll still get to say more.
*  OK, but the problem is, OK, the problem is right now that a whole younger generation has risen up and it's now Steinem has returned.
*  OK, she's like a like a bad penny. She's back again.
*  So we have to wait. So I mean, I feel like I'm back to square one.
*  Next question here.
*  I'm sorry we can't go on.
*  All right. Thanks for coming.
*  So you mentioned your incident with Catherine Deneuve and you also talked about that in 1995 in Playboy, you know, following her and also having 599 pictures of Elizabeth Taylor.
*  So but then at the same time earlier this year, you when David Bowie passed away and you mentioned how he had reached out to you and wanted to meet you.
*  You talked about how you weren't sure you would have wanted to because you have to keep respectful distance from an artist that towering stature.
*  Yeah. So, you know, you also mentioned that interview that obsession and genius are pretty much the same thing.
*  So where would you draw the line between, you know, say you have an opportunity to meet someone who who's very important to you or contrive a meeting or just seek them out.
*  Where do you draw the line between the obsession?
*  And I mean, the the Polly kind of obsession, not the Roy Hinckley kind, and just that respectful distance.
*  I mean, do you stifle creativity with respect for, you know, who this person is and their privacy?
*  Well, I think I personally have never had this great desire necessarily to meet the figures that I most admire in the arts because I understand that what they represent on screen is something that is a, you know, it's an artificial construction.
*  It's not it's not the reality that I've been working in art schools, also my entire career.
*  So I know I have dancers in my class, I have actors in my class, and I can understand the difference between between the the fallible, you know, real self, the mundane real self.
*  And the and the artistic self suddenly emerges within what I what I call the, you know, the Temenos, which is the sacred precinct that I regard as as art.
*  And therefore, when I encountered Catherine Duneuve by accident that day, and I was at the peak of my obsession with her, it really almost ruined my interest in her.
*  OK, because it's like, oh, my God, it's like, you know, it's not the real Catherine Duneuve that I was so intent on.
*  It was it was this magical creation that is a result of her talent, but also of the director's own magical skills and so on.
*  Oh, yes, Elizabeth Taylor. I have 599 pictures. Yes.
*  People often say what's odd about that is not the number, but that I had counted them.
*  But yes, she oh, she represented to me everything that the pure sexuality that was had been repressed during the during the Doris Day 1950s and early 60s.
*  Butterfield Day still remains for me like a great pagan exhibition.
*  OK, here's Elizabeth Taylor, the high high class call girl.
*  Oh, my God. And I had John Moreau, you know, and Monica Viti and, you know, in Nuka Mae.
*  And there were so many Melina Mercuri.
*  There were so many phenomenal images that I was inundated with when I was in high school and college.
*  And what and what do these kids have today?
*  You know, Taylor Swift. Oh, my God.
*  OK, she is such a fake.
*  She poses and things that she imagines are sexy and sultry.
*  And it's like so fake. Awful, awful, awful.
*  But at least Rihanna, who's like, you know, undubed most of the time, that's why she looks so sultry.
*  OK, but, you know, Rihanna's Instagrams are to me like a work of art.
*  That's the only thing I'm following right now.
*  I have to say that's of equal importance is Rihanna, you know, floating from one from one nightclub to another.
*  OK, and yet yet some other fashionable thing.
*  But back to your question.
*  Wait, did I answer? I don't know if I answered.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Oh, David Bowie. David Bowie.
*  OK, now Bowie, you know, I wrote this essay called Theater Agenda.
*  David Bowie at the climax of the sexual revolution.
*  I wrote it for the Victorian Albert exhibition catalog for the costume show that they did.
*  And it's now still touring the world.
*  And I consider it one of my most important pieces.
*  But it's in the catalog.
*  I want to get into my next essay collection.
*  But with Bowie, I mean, see Bowie is like different than Deneuve.
*  I mean, Bowie is truly like a creative artist.
*  I mean, whereas Deneuve and Taylor are performers in other people's fictions.
*  But Bowie was truly a master creator of a level that just is staggering.
*  When I did the research for the essay, I just was, I knocked out all over again at the enormity of what he achieved.
*  And also at how little has been acknowledged his deep knowledge of the visual arts and how he had been influenced by that.
*  I found all kinds of little details that showed his deep knowledge, his erudition about that.
*  And it appears to be that he did tell the V&A to invite.
*  So that time, people don't know.
*  What you're talking about is where it was like earlier in the 1990s.
*  And a message came to my publisher saying, and it was conveyed to me by the publicist, my publisher, saying, David Bowie wants your phone number.
*  And I burst out laughing.
*  I said, oh, that's ridiculous.
*  I said, oh, boy, it's just some fan trying to get it.
*  So they said, oh, David Bowie, the claim really wants your phone number.
*  I said, is that the way David Bowie gets in touch when he wants your phone number?
*  So I laughed.
*  And I didn't believe it.
*  And it was all so shadowy.
*  Only now, only after I did the research for this Torin Albert thing, did I realize that the reason it was so strange was that he had fired his entire management.
*  He had fired his company, dealing with the record companies and so on, after Berlin.
*  And that he only dealt with the world via friends.
*  And so that's what was so strange about it.
*  It was strange.
*  And so I made a mistake.
*  And what he wanted was he wanted to use an excerpt from Sexual Personae on a record album in one of his lyrics.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So it's very embarrassing that that happened.
*  But that's OK.
*  I mean, I really don't, I think there should be a distance with greater, a sense of respect and reserve with great artists.
*  Next question.
*  Hi.
*  So I'm Kelly Ferguson.
*  Oh, hi.
*  Hi.
*  OK.
*  And I'm told today is equal payday.
*  So that makes the question I want to ask you about pay disparity even more relevant, I guess.
*  I'm thinking about it a lot.
*  And it seems to me that it boils down to a problem of culture to the extent that, for example, Mark Zuckerberg publicizing taking paternity leave does more to alleviate the pay disparity problem that we have than either companies or governments setting a policy.
*  Because to the extent that the demand for flexibility to have children and care for children is only used by women, it's going to hurt us on the margin when it comes to pay.
*  And since you're such a great and incisive social critic, I just want to get your thoughts on that.
*  Well, I mean, first of all, I think the way my own party, the Democratic Party, is using this rubric of equal pay for women as if this has not been a matter of law ever since the presidency of JFK, for heaven's sakes.
*  I mean, there may be cases about outrageous disparity in pay for doing the same work.
*  Now and then they'll find something like in a hospital, a woman doctor, a veteran doctor was not being paid the same level.
*  But it's rare when these actual cases do surface.
*  There's all this propaganda being pumped out about this issue when in fact women are not, if women are earning 72 cents or 75 cents on the dollar, it's not for the same job.
*  This is a lie that's being told.
*  Women are not doing the same job as a man, are not being paid 75 cents for something that the man is being paid.
*  What it is is overall the averages of women of their own volition for whatever reasons are taking jobs that have more flexibility as opposed to the around the clock, seven days a week, night thing.
*  For example, women tend to shy away from commission sales jobs where they're on the road a lot.
*  And that's where a lot of men have very high earnings.
*  Women are making choices.
*  They would prefer to be closer to their children.
*  So yes, these disparities are ultimately based in biological differences.
*  So now Susan Faludi and these other feminists of the Steinem credo, they have one answer.
*  Men must do more.
*  That's their answer.
*  Men must do more.
*  Susan Faludi has never had a child, so she has absolutely no idea.
*  And what I feel is that there is a tie.
*  There is an ineffable, indefinable, biological tie between a child and the mother in whose body the child has developed into a full being.
*  And that there are all kinds of impulses and instincts that women may have of protectiveness toward their biologically born children.
*  I think to politicize the thing and to assume that a woman bearing a child is like an automaton, yes, here is the baby, here to my husband, you are equally fit to be able to nurture this month old, three month old child.
*  As a child gets a little older and turns into a real human being with a personality and so on, it's not so dependent.
*  That is when men can do more.
*  But I still believe personally from my observation of human life that there is something going on.
*  The infant doesn't want the father.
*  Hello.
*  The infant wants the mother.
*  He wants the nice, koochie.
*  The smell is the mother.
*  Who is this person coming closer?
*  I was like, go away.
*  Freud talked about that.
*  This distraction comes in.
*  The father.
*  Get out.
*  Remember?
*  This is why Freud said every child wants to kill the father and marry the mother.
*  I said, oh.
*  Men don't know what to do.
*  Men are clumsy.
*  They have the big hands and so on.
*  And what I have seen from my observation is that women, and this is because I have a child who I'm adopted.
*  I'm from my former partner and so on.
*  What I have seen is the world of the moms.
*  I have seen the world of the moms from the inside.
*  And what I see is that the minute the children are born, the woman, it's the woman who biologically, I believe, has the master strategist mind.
*  She is the generalissimo of the household.
*  The man, her husband, who was once her equal, shrinks down to merely one counter.
*  Becomes one.
*  It is she who issues the master plan for the week.
*  He is hopeless.
*  She has the multiple levels.
*  She knows what, and she's the one who talks to the schedule and so on.
*  And the good father is the one who says, okay, yes, I will do.
*  Give me the plan.
*  Give me the sheet.
*  But to ask men to do more seems to me to ask them to do something that they are not biologically prepared to do.
*  Our next question is from a...
*  Sorry, that was so interesting.
*  I wanted to go on, but it's all right.
*  Yes.
*  All right.
*  I'd just like to preface my question by saying that as a whirlwind, Job's God has nothing on you.
*  Oh.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Thank you.
*  My question is, do you have any concern that modern literature and eventually all the classics will have to be rewritten so that in order to be understood,
*  every fifth word will have to be the word like?
*  Well, unfortunately, the sense of language in general or just respect for language or interest in language is degenerating.
*  I mean, I'm someone who used to write down...
*  I used to write down...
*  I mean, I always write down any word I don't know.
*  When I'm reading, I would make lists and I would study the dictionary and etymologies.
*  And now young people have no concern for language per se, the way they communicate with each other.
*  An email format now in text is very truncated.
*  And that's why the writing on the web has also degenerated horribly.
*  The writing for blogs is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  It used to be with newspapers and magazines, there was a space limit.
*  And that imposed a real format.
*  It forced it to condense and it gave a kind of crispness to language.
*  So we're in a period now, I'm afraid, that the ear for language is degenerating.
*  One last question, very quickly.
*  Oh, the last one? Oh, no.
*  All right, I'll try to be quick.
*  In my view, feminists have made a lot of progress in the Western world in the last century.
*  And I'm curious to know if you think we're close to basically achieving the goals that were set out,
*  or if the feminists will ever feel like the fact that more women go to college these days, for example,
*  is a symbol of progress, or that they'll never feel like the job has been done.
*  You have one minute, 30 seconds to answer this question.
*  Oh, no. Well, I'm an equal opportunity feminist, by which I believe that all apps to women's advance
*  and the political and professional realms should be removed.
*  But what I'm also saying is that there are huge areas of human life that are not political.
*  They have to do with our private spiritual natures.
*  And that is a place where legislation will always be helpless and hopeless, and indeed intrusive.
*  So I think that feminism has made enormous gains.
*  There was a time when women were totally dependent on father, on husband, on brother for their survival.
*  Now women can be self-supporting, can live totally on their own.
*  And it's part of this whole Western world powered by capitalism that our university curricula are now habitually always demeaning.
*  I mean, capitalism made women's emancipation possible.
*  So I think that the problem right now is that young women have been taught to somehow identify their own sense of personal unhappiness with men.
*  Men are responsible for our own happiness.
*  When in fact, part of the issue is that we have lived as a species for like tens of thousands of years,
*  where mating occurred early, was early, where you left your parents' house and had your own household and your own children.
*  I mean, Juliet in Romeo and Juliet is 13 going on 14.
*  Already she's ready for marriage.

*  Just to close, Steven Pinker will be coming in October 24th.

*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
