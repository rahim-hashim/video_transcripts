# Tom Tugendhat on Modernizing the UK and Political Reform | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50)
*  Today I am chatting with Tom Tugentot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=0.0s)]
*  Tom has served as a member of parliament for Tonebridge since 2015. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=6.88s)]
*  He has served as security minister. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=11.24s)]
*  He has also stood up to the UK's enemies and been sanctioned by Russia, China, and Iran [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=13.52s)]
*  for that privilege. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=19.16s)]
*  As a backbencher, Tom was elected by MPs to serve as the chair of the Foreign Affairs [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=20.84s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=25.32s)]
*  Before being elected as an MP, Tom served in military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=26.68s)]
*  He's worked for the Foreign Office, helped to set up the National Security Council of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=32.68s)]
*  Afghanistan and on returning to the UK. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=36.6s)]
*  Tom served as military assistant to the chief of the defence staff, the professional head [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=40.72s)]
*  of the UK Armed Forces. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=45.32s)]
*  Tom, welcome. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=47.44s)]
*  Thank you, Tyler. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=49.44s)]
*  It's lovely to see you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=50.44s)]
*  Forgive me, I've just been interrupted by a child. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=51.44s)]
*  It's my boy, Adam. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  This is my boy, Adam. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=54.56s)]
*  Hi, Adam. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=55.56s)]
*  It's nice to see you again. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=56.56s)]
*  You probably don't remember me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=57.56s)]
*  You remember Tyler? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=60.28s)]
*  You met Tyler? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=61.28s)]
*  No, I don't remember. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=62.28s)]
*  You did meet Tyler, yes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=63.28s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=64.28s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=65.28s)]
*  His memory isn't as good as yours. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=66.28s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=68.28s)]
*  Okay, Prusa, can you leave me alone? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=69.28s)]
*  How old was I? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=71.08s)]
*  A few years ago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=72.08s)]
*  Go on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=73.08s)]
*  Two years ago. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=74.08s)]
*  Two years ago, exactly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=75.08s)]
*  Can you close the door, please? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=76.08s)]
*  Sorry, I apologize for that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=77.08s)]
*  No, don't worry. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=80.08s)]
*  No problem. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=81.08s)]
*  You know the famous Korean clip. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=82.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=84.04s)]
*  By CNN. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=85.04s)]
*  It's one of the greatest TV episodes of all time and fully natural. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  Okay, first question. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=90.72s)]
*  What is your favorite walk around London and what does it show about the city that outsiders [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  might not understand? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  My favorite walk is down the river. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people walk down the river, but one of the best things about walking down the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  river in London is first of all, it shows two things. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  One, that London is actually an incredibly private place. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=110.28s)]
*  You can be completely on your own in the center of one of the biggest cities in the world [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=113.5s)]
*  within seconds just by walking down the river. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  Very often even in the middle of the day, there's nobody there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  You walk past things that are just extraordinary. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=123.74s)]
*  You walk past a customs house. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=126.02s)]
*  Okay, it's not used anymore, but it was the customs house for three, four, 500 years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=127.38s)]
*  You walk past obviously the Tower of London. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=131.82s)]
*  You walk past Tower Bridge. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=134.26s)]
*  You walk past many things like that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=135.26s)]
*  Actually, you're walking past a lot of modern London as well and you see the reality of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=136.74s)]
*  London, which is actually the truth is London isn't a single city. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=141.86s)]
*  It's many, many different villages all cobbled together in various different ways. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  And so I think outsiders miss the fact that there's a real intimacy to London that you [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=149.94000000000003s)]
*  miss if all you're doing is you're going on the tube or if you're going on the bus. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=155.86s)]
*  If you walk down that river, you see a very, very different kind of London. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  You see real communities and real small smaller communities. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=163.18s)]
*  As a question of governance, how does London becoming so large, so wealthy, so successful [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=168.34s)]
*  mesh with the relatively weak federalism of the UK? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  One might think if you have a city that critical, you need a lot of federalism to build up the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  intermediary bodies governing it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  Is something in there need to be changed or is it optimal as is? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it does need to be changed, but the reality is the UK is a very, very [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  centralised state. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=191.78s)]
*  So I mean, although there is a mayor of London, of course, there's a mayor of London. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  The reality is the mayor has very, very limited powers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=196.94s)]
*  They control transport for London. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=199.74s)]
*  They are joint heads of the city police force, the Metropolitan Police, the Home Secretary. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=201.78s)]
*  So our interior minister and the mayor of London both have the ability to fire the commissioner [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=209.22s)]
*  of the Metropolitan Police. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=213.78s)]
*  And the mayor has certain rights or rather powers on planning, but that's actually mixed [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=215.74s)]
*  with the boroughs as well. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=220.78s)]
*  So it's a much more diffuse system. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=221.98s)]
*  If you compare it to the United States, it's nowhere near as powerful as the mayor of New [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=225.06s)]
*  York, for example, or a regional governor or something like that, or a state governor. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=229.22s)]
*  Sorry, forgive me. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  So how should we change that to make London better governed? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think the big thing for London actually is to make sure that its transport connections [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=238.94s)]
*  to the region are stronger. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=243.34s)]
*  I mean, the real hold up for the whole of the United Kingdom is the lack of infrastructure [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=244.34s)]
*  investment over whatever it is, 30, 40 years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=248.02s)]
*  We've just seen Crossrail built and already it looks like it's going to be at breakeven [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=251.5s)]
*  point in the next five or six years, which is a remarkable speed of return. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  And the reason for the speed of the returns, frankly, that so little other infrastructure [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=260.86s)]
*  has been built. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  So it's almost in a, it's not quite a monopoly provider status, but you know what I mean? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  It's got such a dominant ability to provide for the community that it's making a huge [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=269.42s)]
*  difference. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=274.42s)]
*  And the biggest thing that London could do is to get the investment going. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=275.42s)]
*  And it's not just true of London, that's true of Manchester, Birmingham, all of our cities [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=278.66s)]
*  and all of our towns as well. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=282.38s)]
*  We need a massive injection of infrastructure investment in the United Kingdom. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=283.7s)]
*  And we need the leadership to provide it because if you look at, if you look at the pattern [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=287.66s)]
*  of growth in the United Kingdom, we were growing at a very healthy percentage, you know, two [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=291.94s)]
*  to three percent up until 2007, eight. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=296.18s)]
*  And the fall off since then has left us effectively, I mean, depending on who you ask anywhere [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=300.12s)]
*  between 18 and 25 percent poorer. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=306.1s)]
*  Why do you think England in particular is so unbalanced economically compared, say, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=309.74s)]
*  to the Netherlands or Germany? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=314.94s)]
*  What is it in the history? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=316.86s)]
*  Or is it really just the infrastructure links? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=318.54s)]
*  So the infrastructure is hugely important. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=321.1s)]
*  If you're not willing to connect Britain, guess what? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=323.06s)]
*  You get concentrations, you get real concentrations. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=325.02s)]
*  And then the challenge is you get the concentrations and you don't get the housing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=328.02s)]
*  So if you don't have the housing, you don't have the ability to invest. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=331.26s)]
*  One of the one of the striking things, actually, is the mayor of London, who's been in place [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=334.5s)]
*  now for eight to eight and a bit years, has been a complete failure in building houses. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=339.38s)]
*  He's been really reticent on building houses and he talks about rent control, which, as [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  you know, the moment you start talking about rent control, nobody wants to rent a house [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=348.5s)]
*  and nobody wants to build a house because it I mean, you don't need me to tell you this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=351.62s)]
*  can't, but it's all right, Tyler, but it's one of the is one of the single greatest threats [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  to to to the ability to house people is to introduce rent controls. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=359.34s)]
*  It's a complete disaster of policy that's been tried a hundred times and failed a hundred [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=364.02s)]
*  times. And and that's what he's talking about. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  But that's Labour's controlling attitude rather than the the ability to build. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=370.78s)]
*  So I think there is a strong argument for having greater devolved [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=374.34s)]
*  interest in infrastructure development. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=380.06s)]
*  But we're a we're a smaller country than the United States. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  So infrastructure can't be all local. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  It can't be all done at a state level, if you see what I mean. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=387.18s)]
*  But nor can it be all national as we're so much bigger than, say, Belgium or the Netherlands. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  So we need that relationship. We need a better relationship between our devolved powers and our [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=396.18s)]
*  national power. And that's and that's something we haven't achieved yet. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=400.3s)]
*  What's your most controversial opinion about London architecture? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=404.1s)]
*  Oh, the recent architecture actually can be absolutely fantastic. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=408.26000000000005s)]
*  There's some really beautiful recent architecture, there's some beautiful town squares, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=412.3s)]
*  you know, the sort of urban squares built recently and the the condemnation of modern [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=416.38s)]
*  architecture, I think, is is wrong. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=422.06s)]
*  I'm I'm a fan of what some architects call pastiche. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=424.62s)]
*  You don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=430.74s)]
*  If there's a good design, if there's a good form of architecture that works that people like, I [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=432.82s)]
*  don't see what's wrong with repeating it just because you've changed the change the plumbing or the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=437.86s)]
*  wiring or the or the behind the, you know, behind the facade. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=442.06s)]
*  But even though we're much wealthier and better educated, it seems that we and I don't just mean [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=446.53999999999996s)]
*  the UK here, we can't build anything like, say, Bath or York. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=451.5s)]
*  And why is that? Where have we gone wrong? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=456.78s)]
*  Well, we can actually. The King has built Poundbury. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=459.18s)]
*  I've seen some fantastic designs for communities near Favisham. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=463.3s)]
*  I've seen some really nice designs for communities in other parts of Kent. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=466.41999999999996s)]
*  And there are people who are willing to do it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=471.53999999999996s)]
*  But the challenge you've got is you've got to have long term interest. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=473.5s)]
*  And actually, the great irony is that what we've what we've swapped is we've swapped the ability to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=477.1s)]
*  plan for the long term with the ability to plan only for the short. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=482.18s)]
*  And once you do that, then you put huge financial constraints on. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=484.86s)]
*  And once you restrict the ability of people to access land and so you put all of the costs on the land [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=488.14s)]
*  rather than on the building, you end up massively distorting the amount that people are willing to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=493.74s)]
*  spend on the architecture and on the quality. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=497.3s)]
*  Because, of course, you know, people aren't doing this for charity. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=499.5s)]
*  They need to make a profit out of it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=502.38s)]
*  Profit is a perfectly noble motivation. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=504.34s)]
*  And we need to make sure that people are able to do that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=506.86s)]
*  But if we constrain their ability to spend on beautiful architecture by restricting the supply of land, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=509.58s)]
*  so they have to plan inflated price for that, then you end up with worse quality design and worse quality [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=515.54s)]
*  housing. If I think back to the 1970s and I suppose even the 60s in Britain, my impression is a lot of [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=521.58s)]
*  very good buildings were knocked down, probably by mistake. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  Is that why Yimby has a bad name in a lot of Britain today? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=532.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=535.98s)]
*  How is it we ensure we get Yimby, but don't repeat the mistakes of the 1970s? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=536.3399999999999s)]
*  Or say a Christopher Wrench Arch is destroyed. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=541.54s)]
*  Look, I think that's exactly right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=544.78s)]
*  And when you I mean, you don't need me to tell you this, but you see the same in New York, the destruction [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=546.1s)]
*  of Grand, not Grand Central, the other one, Penn State, Pennsylvania Street Station was appalling. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=550.3s)]
*  And you see it in the attempt to destroy, thank God that was resisted by Betjeman, but the attempt [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=557.66s)]
*  to destroy St Pancras Station was something that was done, the destruction of Euston Station. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=564.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, we've seen some really appalling acts of vandalism. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=569.42s)]
*  And in fact, the King was one of the people, the first people to criticize it in various speeches [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=573.02s)]
*  in 1980s. And at the time, he was constantly referred to as a young fogey. And now he seems [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=577.66s)]
*  to have been rather more prescient than I think people recognized at the time. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=582.4599999999999s)]
*  And one of the things that we've got to do is we've got to make sure that we're building [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=587.1s)]
*  beautiful. There's a really interesting piece of work being done by a guy called Nicholas [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=590.46s)]
*  Boyce Smith on Create Streets is his project. And it's about building beautiful. And it's amazing [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=594.46s)]
*  when you when you set out beautiful design codes, when you set out buildings that really add to the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=600.38s)]
*  environment, people don't object so much. You know, it's hardly surprising that if you're if [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=605.42s)]
*  you're going to build some modernist monstrosity next to my house, I might object if you're going [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=609.58s)]
*  to build some sort of Georgian villas that add to the to the feeling of the area, then then I may [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=614.14s)]
*  feel that you're you're increasing the value of my house, not diminishing it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=619.66s)]
*  What makes Kent, which is where you're based, special in the history of England, as you see it? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=623.9s)]
*  Oh, Kent is remarkable, actually, and very different from the rest of England. It's very [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=629.1s)]
*  underappreciated. But but I'm a proud citizen of the sovereign and independent kingdom of Kent, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=633.66s)]
*  something OK, I admit that we haven't been for about a thousand years, but but we still claim it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=639.34s)]
*  So Kent was actually colonised, if that's the right word to use by the jutes, not by the Angles [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=643.74s)]
*  and Saxons, so by a different Viking tribe, a different Viking people. And instead of having [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=648.94s)]
*  prima geneture, so the inheritance of the eldest son, they had the Frankish inheritance, which was [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=654.0600000000001s)]
*  the inheritance shared between the the male heirs of the father. Now, it's still sexist, but it meant [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=659.34s)]
*  that you ended up with a very different system. So you ended up with much smaller parcels of land, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=666.78s)]
*  you end up with much smaller land holdings. And that had several effects. Actually, one of the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=671.1s)]
*  effects it had was it saw the greatest rise of industry, because of course, you can't effectively [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=675.26s)]
*  just farm the rents of your peasants by owning a lot of land, then you actually have to do something [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=680.94s)]
*  about it. So you see, for example, the the rise of industry in Kent earlier than other places, you [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=685.02s)]
*  see, you know, the the arrows that were made for the Battle of Cressy and the battle of and the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=691.26s)]
*  were all made in Kent, they were made by Kentish, you know, Kentish ironworks, and they were made [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=697.9s)]
*  because there were small holdings, and there were small holdings, because people only had enough land [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=705.66s)]
*  to farm for themselves, they didn't have enough to profit off the wealth of others. You then see, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=709.26s)]
*  of course, the fact that Kent is on the crossroads of Europe, of course, and you know, don't forget, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=713.66s)]
*  seaways were the highways of the medieval world. So being on the coast, and particularly on the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=718.62s)]
*  coast between England and France and the low countries and Germany, meant that you were right [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=724.46s)]
*  on the on the front line of commerce and ideas. So you get ideas coming into Kent. In fact, one of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=730.86s)]
*  the one of the I mean, the obviously right at the beginning, it was, it was the Romans who landed in [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=736.7800000000001s)]
*  in Kent and came up and fought the Kentish men at the Battle of Snotland in in just before the turn [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=743.82s)]
*  of the first, just before the turn of the year zero. And the and you then see the reintroduction [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=749.74s)]
*  of Christianity in about 600 when St. Augustine comes along and meets with the first Christian [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=757.02s)]
*  Queen of Kent Queen Bertha. And so you get these ideas and later on you get the Protestantism that [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=762.94s)]
*  comes through and you get revolution, of course, because you get the peasants revolt comes from [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=768.38s)]
*  Kent. And that's so when what Tyler managed to get the men of Kent to rise against the king, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=772.14s)]
*  but you get so you get various ideas and various uprisings out of Kent. So Kent is a land of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=778.14s)]
*  revolution and ideas. And how does that shape the politics in Kent today that history? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=782.46s)]
*  It's challenging. It's still challenging. It's an it's an area where you get political innovation, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=788.22s)]
*  you get political ideas coming out, you know, in recent years, we've seen, we've certainly seen [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=792.6999999999999s)]
*  some different politics coming out of the coastal areas of Kent, out of the center, we've seen [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=798.6999999999999s)]
*  different areas of challenge. But it's some of it's eroded away. But but but you still have [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=804.38s)]
*  smaller land holdings, you still have you still have much more of a feeling of equality in Kent [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=810.78s)]
*  than you do in many other parts of the United Kingdom. Now your town of Tonbridge has a very [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=816.62s)]
*  famous private school. Does that system need general reform in the UK? Or is it just fine as is? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=821.34s)]
*  No, look, it's I think it has reformed an awful lot. I mean, the impressions about what a school [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=828.22s)]
*  does in a community, I think, are very often mistaken. I mean, Tunbridge School not only [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=833.18s)]
*  gives out large numbers of bursaries, so a lot of the kids who go there don't pay full fees, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=838.14s)]
*  very description quite a lot don't, there's a fair few who don't pay anything at all. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=843.02s)]
*  But also the school has a really important role in the community. So it's sports track and it's, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=847.66s)]
*  you know, and it's sports facilities are used by the whole town at various different points. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=852.38s)]
*  And, and very often for either low or free. A lot of the other schools use the theatre and use their [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=857.5799999999999s)]
*  facilities like that. And they run something in which is relatively common in the Arctic [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=863.9s)]
*  Kingdom called a combined cadet force. And various other kids are involved in elements of that as [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=868.4599999999999s)]
*  well. So it's, it's not a standalone, you know, 4050 years ago, it would have been a very standalone [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=873.26s)]
*  institution, but the fees would have been relatively lower. Now, the institution is much [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=878.78s)]
*  more integrated in many ways into this, into the town. It's true that the fees are higher, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=884.7s)]
*  they are, they are very high. But the but what it offers the rest of the community is also [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=889.9000000000001s)]
*  a huge amount. Putting aside present company, who was the great unselected Prime Minister in [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=895.9000000000001s)]
*  British history? Thank you, Tyler. It was Dennis Healy, Michael Heseltine, Roy Jenkins, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=902.22s)]
*  others. Who's your pick? Look, I think all of those people are really interesting. I think Ken Clark [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=908.62s)]
*  would have been very interesting as well. I mean, actually, I think most recently, the one who [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=915.42s)]
*  would have been Prime Minister, had he stayed in parliament is George Osborne. I think when [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=921.98s)]
*  Theresa May came back after the 2017 election with a not only a reduced majority, but actually, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=927.66s)]
*  a slight minority administration, I think George Osborne would have been Prime Minister [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=934.5400000000001s)]
*  within weeks had he stayed in parliament, but he stood down. And so I think it was a, you know, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=940.94s)]
*  that's one of those moments where, you know, sliding doors in the history is slightly different. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=946.46s)]
*  Can the British system of government in its current parliamentary form, how well can that work without [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=951.1s)]
*  broadly liberal individualistic foundations in public opinion? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=957.74s)]
*  I think it works extremely well at ensuring that truly liberal foundations are maintained. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=963.26s)]
*  I mean that not in the American sense. I mean in a genuine, the old liberal tradition that is, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=970.94s)]
*  that emerges from the UK in the 17, 1800s, where freedom of thought, freedom of, you know, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=977.02s)]
*  freedom of assembly, the right to own property, and all those principles that then became embedded [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=984.14s)]
*  in various different constitutions around the world, including your own. You know, I think [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=989.66s)]
*  it does very well at doing that because it forces you, our system forces you into partnership. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=993.58s)]
*  You know, there are 650 people who you have to work with in some way in parliament over the next [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=999.98s)]
*  four or five years. And there's four of us currently going for leadership of the Conservative Party. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1006.78s)]
*  And there's one reason why, despite the fact that we're competing almost in a US primary system, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1011.74s)]
*  the way in which we are dealing with each other is very different, is because we're all going to [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1018.38s)]
*  have to work together for the next four years. Whoever wins is going to have to work with the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1023.74s)]
*  other three. And the idea that you can simply ignore each other isn't true. There's only 121 [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1027.98s)]
*  of us Conservative MPs in parliament. And what this system forces on us is the need to deal with [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1034.14s)]
*  each other in a way that you have to deal with somebody if you're going to deal with them tomorrow. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1040.62s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why the British political system has endured, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1045.58s)]
*  because it forces you to remember that there's a long term interest, not an immediate one, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1050.1399999999999s)]
*  not just a short term one. Putting aside particular hypotheses about specific elections, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1054.3s)]
*  but why do you think for a while now party outcomes in the UK have become quite uneven, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1060.62s)]
*  relative to say the continent, that is one party will win by quite a bit, right? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1065.7399999999998s)]
*  Well, it's partly down to the system, right? I mean, it's a very small number of votes in [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1070.22s)]
*  a certain number of seats can swing certain seats quite a lot. So if you look at the results of the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1074.22s)]
*  last election, for example, in 24, in July on the fourth of July this year, you know, the Labour [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1080.1399999999999s)]
*  Party won with a majority of 179 off 33 and a bit 34% of the vote. Now, normally, an opposition [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1088.6999999999998s)]
*  party will get 34% of the vote and the governing party will get 38, 40% of the vote. But what Labour [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1095.74s)]
*  have achieved is they've managed to get a lot of very narrow wins. So they've got a lot of wins by [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1103.02s)]
*  500 or 1000 votes across the country. In fact, it would only require, I know it doesn't sound, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1109.42s)]
*  it's quite a big only, but it would only require 175,000 votes to switch for it to be reduced [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1116.14s)]
*  from a majority to a minority. Now, admittedly, that's a lot of votes, right? But the truth is, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1122.14s)]
*  when you look at an electorate of 40 million, that's not that much to switch from effectively [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1127.66s)]
*  a two thirds victory in the Commons to a 50-50. And putting aside any party loyalties, but does [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1132.8600000000001s)]
*  the thinness of those mandates make you more optimistic about liberalism broadly construed [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1140.94s)]
*  in the UK? Yes, it does. It makes me much more optimistic about it. And the reason is, because [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1146.0600000000002s)]
*  the only way you get these mandates is by appealing to a wide enough section of your own [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1151.98s)]
*  voting bloc and by convincing those who are against you either to support you or to stay away. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1158.78s)]
*  And they stay away when they're not interested in supporting their own side or they're not too [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1165.9s)]
*  fearful of you. So you'll look at, for example, the 2019 election, the turnout was very, very high. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1170.54s)]
*  And it was very high because a lot of people either were extremely angry at one of the party [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1177.26s)]
*  leaders, or they were absolutely determined that their own party leaders should win. And the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1184.06s)]
*  combination of the two meant it generated very high turnouts on both sides, as it were. And it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1188.86s)]
*  also meant that the major political parties, the two major political parties got the bulk of the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1193.34s)]
*  vote. Whereas in 2019, there's a lot of people who were angry at us, the conservatives, after 14 years [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1197.9799999999998s)]
*  in office. But there was no real enthusiasm for Keir Starmer, nor was there any great fear of Keir [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1204.78s)]
*  Starmer. And that meant that you got, first of all, a very low turnout, but you also get a very low [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1210.06s)]
*  margin of victory in percentage terms, although you end up with a very large majority in electoral [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1215.74s)]
*  terms. And that means that these things can change quickly. And I think the important thing in a [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1222.1399999999999s)]
*  democracy is to be ready for change and to make sure that ideas, good ideas, can cut through. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1228.46s)]
*  And that's why, you know, I'm extremely optimistic for the next election, for example, because I [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1234.3799999999999s)]
*  think that the kind of economic reforms that we need to see, the sort of conservative revolution [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1238.3799999999999s)]
*  that we need to see, that the back to service, back to leadership, and back to action that we [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1243.5s)]
*  need to see is something that can generate a real swing and a real momentum behind it [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1248.54s)]
*  relatively quickly, and certainly within four years. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1254.3799999999999s)]
*  Now, it's a common view with outsiders that the mechanisms through which Brexit evolved and was [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1257.42s)]
*  achieved show there was some kind of defect in the UK system of government, that somehow you got stuck [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1263.3400000000001s)]
*  at a certain point and there weren't enough moving parts in the system to budge you from that, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1269.82s)]
*  either to getting the deal done or reversing it. So independent of whatever one thinks of Brexit, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1275.3400000000001s)]
*  do you accept that criticism that somehow the system can get stuck? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1280.94s)]
*  So I accept the criticism at the time, and the reason I accepted at the time is because we had [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1285.42s)]
*  something that was introduced called the Fixed Terms Parliaments Act, which meant that the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1292.78s)]
*  government in theory could not dissolve parliament. Now, you can have two systems, right? You can [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1296.78s)]
*  either have a system of government where the government sits outside the parliament and they [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1302.54s)]
*  both have fixed terms, in which case you have a mandate that endures like that, but then you [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1306.46s)]
*  get your obstacles between the two. Or you can have the government in our system where the [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1311.9s)]
*  government by definition can command a majority in the Commons. That is the definition of a [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1315.18s)]
*  government in our system. It's anybody who can command the majority in the Commons is by definition [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1320.7s)]
*  the prime minister. Now, we got to a position because of the Fixed Terms Parliaments Act, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1324.94s)]
*  which was introduced during the coalition years, where there was somebody in the Commons [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1329.74s)]
*  who was sitting in the seat of the prime minister but could not command a majority. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1334.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, that led to complete inertia until the Lib Dems made a [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1339.02s)]
*  credulously stupid mistake and thought that they were about to sort of win an anti-Brexit vote and [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1343.26s)]
*  lead themselves to victory. And they forced an election. Actually, had they hung on and [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1350.06s)]
*  tolerated the inability of parliament to get things done, I think the situation may have been [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1358.14s)]
*  very different. But I think what the lesson was from that was that you need to remember what the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1363.74s)]
*  system is and why it works. Our system means that the prime minister either has the ability [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1368.86s)]
*  to command a majority in parliament or the parliament collapses. And that forces a level [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1374.7s)]
*  of truth and honesty into a debate. That means that members of parliament have to think very [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1379.34s)]
*  hard before they vote against the government, before they vote down their own side, because [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1383.74s)]
*  they may be voting themselves out of office. Should the House of Lords be abolished or phased [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1388.3s)]
*  out? No, it shouldn't. The extraordinary thing about the House of Lords is, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1393.34s)]
*  it's not something that anybody would invent. I might. But it works. Well, you might. You're [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1399.8999999999999s)]
*  right. You're the kind of economist who might. But the weird thing about the hereditary peers, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1405.8999999999999s)]
*  and there's plenty of changes you can make to the hereditary peers, but the weird thing about it is [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1410.86s)]
*  it's a system of randomness that injects lottery into government. Now, I can certainly see an [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1414.4599999999998s)]
*  argument for turning that from a family lottery into a jury system where it's a temporary lottery. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1422.7s)]
*  But the other thing that the House of Lords does, which is very, very difficult in a democracy, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1433.42s)]
*  is it forces you to think longer over time. And what the House of Lords used to do through [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1438.46s)]
*  its hereditary principle was force you to think not only long time over time for yourself, so 20, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1444.3s)]
*  30 years, but actually think generationally. If you want to guard the stability of your country [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1449.98s)]
*  so that your children and your grandchildren inherit your wealth, then you need to be thinking [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1456.06s)]
*  over 50 or 100 years. And one of the problems that democracies have is short-term thinking. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1459.98s)]
*  And balancing long-term and short-term thinking is something that every democracy should be trying [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1465.66s)]
*  to do. Now, I'm not going to tell you that the fact that most of the hereditary peers, in fact, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1470.14s)]
*  I think they're all male, and maybe wrong about that, but there may be a woman amongst them, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1476.06s)]
*  but I think they're all male, is clearly an issue. And the fact that they come from a very narrow [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1480.62s)]
*  demographic of our society is clearly an issue. But the fact that they introduce long-term thinking, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1486.86s)]
*  that they don't actually have the ability to block anything, and that they force, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1492.3799999999999s)]
*  effectively, a power base beyond the day-to-day will of the Prime Minister, I think is a benefit. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1497.6599999999999s)]
*  And I think it's been good to have as a revising chamber. I don't think it should ever have [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1506.62s)]
*  preeminence, and I think the elected chamber should always have the ability to overrule it, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1511.02s)]
*  which we do. But I think having that long-term thinking is really important. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1515.6599999999999s)]
*  â€“ Why has the global fascination with the British monarchy so persisted? Now, surely some of that is [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1519.34s)]
*  the legacy of empire, but it seems to have far outlived. That is the only explanation. The [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1525.74s)]
*  monarchies of the Netherlands, Norway, no one much talks about them, say, in the US, but yours, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1531.26s)]
*  my goodness, you're like the global reserve currency. What's the PR genius behind the [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1537.9s)]
*  header? How did that happen? What's special? â€“ I mean, there's various things. I mean, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1543.66s)]
*  you know King Farouk said when he was in exile after having left Cairo for the last time, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1547.1s)]
*  he said one day there'll only be five kings left. The King of Hearts, the King of Spades, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1551.66s)]
*  the King of Clubs, the King of Diamonds, and the King of England. I think he's partly right, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1555.98s)]
*  and the reason he's partly right is because it was the Queen's genius, actually. I mean, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1564.14s)]
*  we've never been better governed and better ruled than when our reigning monarch is a woman. We've [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1571.34s)]
*  always had very, very good women monarchs, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria, and then Queen Elizabeth [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1576.6200000000001s)]
*  again. It's been a remarkable success that she's been able to be a guiding presence without her [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1580.94s)]
*  voice becoming in any way strident or separatist. She's never divided, and that was a remarkable [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1592.06s)]
*  gift. Now, it's also, I think, the benefit that the English language really helps, and I think the [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1597.42s)]
*  fact that most people in England, well, certainly in England, Wales and Scotland, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1605.42s)]
*  numbers are slightly different, but most people, and Northern Ireland, of course, different again, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1612.38s)]
*  but most people in the United Kingdom take the monarchy seriously and respectfully, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1616.94s)]
*  but know that it's not relevant in a day-to-day sense. I think divorcing the splendid from the [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1623.02s)]
*  sordid, if you like, is rather a healthy way of having a government. We don't like our Prime [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1631.1s)]
*  Minister to be bathed in gold and glory, and we certainly look at your presidential system sometimes [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1637.1799999999998s)]
*  with a little surprise. It does surprise my American friends when I tell them that the entire [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1645.5s)]
*  government can fly in the same plane, but the King and the Prince of Wales are never allowed to travel [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1649.82s)]
*  together. Has the extent of devolution for Scotland and Northern Ireland gone too far? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1654.86s)]
*  Because to an outsider, it seems like they have a great deal of autonomy, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1662.1399999999999s)]
*  but actually not quite enough responsibility for the well-being of the whole polity. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1665.74s)]
*  So I think, I wouldn't say it's gone too far. No, I'd say it's imbalanced, and I think that's right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1670.7s)]
*  I think there's an old principle, which you all know, of aligning accountability, responsibility, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1676.1399999999999s)]
*  and authority. One of the challenges we've got in our devolution system in the UK at the moment is [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1681.1s)]
*  you'd have to be nuts as a devolved representative seeking office, not to promise to pay the streets [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1688.1399999999999s)]
*  of your community with gold, and then to blame Westminster for not paying for it, because you [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1697.4199999999998s)]
*  have very little responsibility for raising any of the money that you're going to spend. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1701.4199999999998s)]
*  So we don't have, in the same way, the same level of, you know, that you'd have in the United States, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1705.42s)]
*  the same level of city, county, you know, state and federal taxation. It's much more centralized [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1711.42s)]
*  in the UK. Now, one of the advantages, of course, is it means that the oversight is stronger. One of [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1716.94s)]
*  the disadvantages, of course, it means the responsibility for each individual area is weaker, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1722.38s)]
*  and that leads to the inequities of infrastructure and housing and the misalignment of incentives [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1728.54s)]
*  that we now see. Certainly, if you look at England, I'm not sure if this is true in Scotland, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1733.74s)]
*  actually, but certainly in England in the 1930s, the local authorities raised more [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1738.6200000000001s)]
*  and were able to keep more business rates. But the changes that came in in 1947-8 in the Town [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1745.5s)]
*  and Country Planning Act meant that a lot of this was centralized, and it became a rebate from central [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1751.1s)]
*  government. And of course, the incentive at that point went away. Now, you're a Roman Catholic, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1756.94s)]
*  and part of your family background is originally Jewish from Austria. Do you think that in any way [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1762.94s)]
*  gives you a slightly different understanding of British history? And if so, what would that be? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1768.38s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it does. I mean, you know, I'm, as you know, I'm pretty British. My uncle sits in the [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1774.06s)]
*  House of Lords. My father was a High Court judge, and I served in the army. Look, I think that [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1781.74s)]
*  perspective is important to me. How much it shapes my view of Englishness or the United Kingdom, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1785.5s)]
*  I don't know. It's, you know, it's certainly impossible to be a Catholic in the United [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1792.38s)]
*  Kingdom and not remember some of the English martyrs who met pretty unpleasant ends under [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1799.9s)]
*  various of our earlier monarchs. And as somebody who served in our intelligence corps, it's impossible [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1806.46s)]
*  not to remember that the first intelligence units in the United Kingdom, well, in England, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1814.7800000000002s)]
*  were set up to hunt Catholic priests. That was literally their purpose, which they were [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1818.86s)]
*  remarkably successful. So I think it shapes me there. And I think the Jewishness as it were, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1824.54s)]
*  and for me, it's entirely past in the sense I'm not culturally Jewish. I'm certainly not religiously, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1830.2199999999998s)]
*  I'm religiously Catholic. But that links me to a lost past in Eastern Europe that I think [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1836.9399999999998s)]
*  reminds me why the investments and the efforts that you make in your own home are so absolutely [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1843.74s)]
*  fundamental to guarding your freedom as well. You know, the work that we do in defending [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1848.7s)]
*  British democracy is absolutely fundamental to guarding all of our liberties. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1855.9s)]
*  Pete Do you think you end up with a deeper understanding of Northern Ireland as a result? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1859.26s)]
*  John It's very hard to overstate the complexity of Northern Ireland. As somebody who's had the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1864.22s)]
*  privilege of having many Northern Irish friends from many different communities, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1872.3s)]
*  be careful what you think you understand. If you think you understand Northern Ireland, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1878.3s)]
*  you may not be understanding anything at all. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1881.4199999999998s)]
*  Pete The immunity provisions of the 2023 Legacy Act for Northern Ireland. Good idea, bad idea? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1883.1s)]
*  You're not sure? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1889.98s)]
*  John Well, look, they're necessary, I'm afraid. And it's incredibly painful because for everybody, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1890.62s)]
*  there's a legacy of pain and loss, right? And everybody feels quite understandably [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1898.6200000000001s)]
*  that they want to have recourse to justice. But the reality is that we've now had 40 years [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1904.94s)]
*  of inquiries, many of them quite literally raking up very, very, very old information again and [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1910.3000000000002s)]
*  again and again and again. And the people who are now being forced through these judicial processes [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1918.5400000000002s)]
*  are now usually men, or in fact, almost entirely men in their late 70s, 80s, whose recollection of [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1924.38s)]
*  events, if they have any recollections at all, are pretty sketchy. And so, we've got to a point [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1932.5400000000002s)]
*  where the correct way of having inquiry into the past is to do historical inquiry based on [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1939.98s)]
*  written record. And I think that's what this offers. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1947.98s)]
*  John What did you learn on active service in Afghanistan that most people would be surprised by? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1950.86s)]
*  John Be kind. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1956.86s)]
*  John Be kind. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1959.58s)]
*  John Yeah. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1961.1799999999998s)]
*  John What do you think is the case for medium term semi-optimism about Afghanistan, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1961.9799999999998s)]
*  or is there no such case? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1968.6999999999998s)]
*  John Medium term, I think it's really hard to make even a medium term optimistic case. I think [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1969.9799999999998s)]
*  there's a long term optimistic case, but it requires some really fundamental changes to [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1977.58s)]
*  several of its neighbouring states. Because the reality is, Afghanistan hasn't been either [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1984.1399999999999s)]
*  in civil war or been the death of empires, as people claim. It's been the playground [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1991.26s)]
*  of others. So you constantly see that bits of Afghanistan are dominated by bits of their [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=1998.1399999999999s)]
*  neighbours. And that domination leads to internal frictions and frictions between the two neighbours. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2004.62s)]
*  So you look at the way in which parts of Afghanistan are effectively played over by [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2010.3s)]
*  different political interests from the region. And you see the effect on the lives of particularly [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2016.3s)]
*  women and girls, but actually everybody in Afghanistan. And it's hard to see without [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2021.82s)]
*  the regional changes, any real optimism. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2026.4599999999998s)]
*  John How did studying Arabic in Yemen affect your life trajectory? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2029.7399999999998s)]
*  Massively and completely unexpectedly. I studied it because I was interested in it. I'm a theology [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2034.8600000000001s)]
*  student and I'm just interested in other religions. And I thought I was studying Islam out of interest. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2040.54s)]
*  But it's because I spoke Arabic that I was mobilised to fight in Iraq. And it was because [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2048.7s)]
*  I was mobilised to fight in Iraq. No, I then served in the Foreign Office and then stayed in [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2052.38s)]
*  the military and ended up in politics. So it's been, funnily enough, it's one of the most [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2058.86s)]
*  consequential decisions I ever took. And I took it very lightly. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2063.82s)]
*  John But what happened? What happens next after you do that? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2068.06s)]
*  John What do you mean? After I study Arabic? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2071.34s)]
*  John Yeah, how did that lead to the next stage of your life? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2074.06s)]
*  John Oh, I see. So I studied Arabic because I was doing a Masters in Islamics and because [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2077.34s)]
*  I spoke Arabic when I left university, I decided to be a journalist. And because I spoke Arabic and [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2082.94s)]
*  French, I went to Beirut. And so I learned to be a journalist by working on a local paper in Beirut, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2088.38s)]
*  did that for a few years, went back to the United Kingdom, and was a management consultant for a [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2095.82s)]
*  whole bit. And while I was doing that, I joined the Brahshami Reserve. And I moved to work for [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2101.42s)]
*  Bloomberg News, writing about commodity markets, analysing the energy industry, that sort of thing. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2109.34s)]
*  And while I was doing that, 9-11 happened, and I was mobilised to go and fight in the various [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  wars that then followed. John [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2121.5s)]
*  As of 2024, Yemen is much in the news as of late. And I find it puzzling if someone asks me, well, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2123.58s)]
*  what are the Houthis seeking to maximise? I don't quite have a good answer. What would you say? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2130.22s)]
*  John I say they're seeking to maximise their tribal influence over Yemen as much as [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2135.18s)]
*  it's possible to do so. They are a remarkable organisation of very, very, very traditional [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2143.58s)]
*  tribal fighting, with some extremely modern access to weaponry, mostly from Iran, but also [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2152.86s)]
*  bought from other places. And at the moment, what they're trying to do is they're trying to [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2158.94s)]
*  close off the Red Sea to limit the ability to sustain Israel, but they're also looking to [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2163.18s)]
*  generally do damage to global trade. John [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2170.14s)]
*  And is that instrumentally rational for them? I know it's a bad thing, but in terms of how they [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2172.7799999999997s)]
*  assess means and relationships, do you see them as rational actors? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2177.58s)]
*  John Yes, they're rational. They're rational within their own metrics. I mean, it's one of [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2181.18s)]
*  those things if people do things you don't expect, it's probably because you haven't understood the [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2185.58s)]
*  reason they're doing it, if you see what I mean. And what they're trying to do is they're trying [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2188.7799999999997s)]
*  to fight a civil war. They're not particularly interested in Israel per se. They're interested [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2193.5s)]
*  in having legitimacy in a civil war. One of the ways you get legitimacy in an internal Islamic [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2199.26s)]
*  civil war is by attacking Israel. And one of the ways in which you get weapons off Iran is by [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2205.0200000000004s)]
*  attacking Israel. So if you want to fight civil war, and you want to have legitimacy in weapons, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2212.3s)]
*  attacking Israel helps you. So it may not have rationality within our thinking, because, you know, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2216.94s)]
*  every now and again, Israel is likely to strike back, and as indeed it did only a few weeks ago. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2225.42s)]
*  And actually closing down shipping in the Red Sea doesn't particularly help you win that civil [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2231.66s)]
*  war, but it does add to your legitimacy and makes you look like a competent military power. So [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2235.9s)]
*  it's done for a different reason. John How should I think about Iran? If I see [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2243.5s)]
*  Iranians abroad, they do so very well, including in Britain. Iran itself has a lot of science, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2248.3s)]
*  a lot of tech, engineering, great deal of talent, and it seems energy, yet the country is somehow [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2254.46s)]
*  fundamentally weak. They have a very bad government. They cannot exercise deterrence. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2262.06s)]
*  What's the most fundamental way of thinking about what's gone wrong there? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2268.46s)]
*  Well, I think you should think about Iran extremely positively. Iran is an incredible [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2271.82s)]
*  country, often unbelievably rich civilization. As you know, you don't need me to tell you that. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2276.3s)]
*  It's an amazing place with some of the most extraordinary scientists and artists [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2282.38s)]
*  that any culture has ever produced. It's a remarkable place. You should think about the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2287.58s)]
*  Iranian regime very differently. That is a cancerous growth on the back of a country that [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2291.7400000000002s)]
*  came out of the chaos of a revolution that many people thought was going to go a completely [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2299.58s)]
*  different way and has effectively leached the life out of millions of people in the most horrific way. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2303.5s)]
*  I mean, it's one of the most brutal and psychotic actors in a dangerous region. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2310.54s)]
*  What it's offering now is effectively a millenarian death cult where it sees, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2318.62s)]
*  when people tell you what they believe, it's often wise to believe that they're telling you [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2325.34s)]
*  the truth. They're telling us very clearly that what they're doing is they're preparing for the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2329.42s)]
*  coming of the Mahdi and they need to destroy Israel and conquer Jerusalem in order to achieve [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2334.38s)]
*  it. They seem to be acting in that way. At least as of the time we're talking, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2341.02s)]
*  in September 2024, their behavior is very cautious. They're not seeking to be sent to [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2346.38s)]
*  heaven immediately. As a social scientist, I'm a little suspicious of explanations [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2351.6600000000003s)]
*  where the society and the government are so totally different, even under autocracy. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2357.02s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2362.78s)]
*  It still foes me. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2363.7400000000002s)]
*  I do see what you're saying. In normal cases that I would sympathize, the reality is that this is a [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2364.06s)]
*  very brutal autocracy. It does murder an awful lot of people a year and it has successfully got [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2371.9s)]
*  most, well, not most, but it's successfully got many people expelled from the country. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2378.46s)]
*  There's a huge Iranian diaspora, as you know, all over the world. There are many extremely [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2387.02s)]
*  impressive Iranians who've followed their own lives away from the dictatorship. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2391.6600000000003s)]
*  I think that alignment of government and people is easier when people can travel and be exiled. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2398.78s)]
*  I think that's what we're seeing. What we're seeing is a vile failure of leadership [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2406.2200000000003s)]
*  and a failure of responsibility. We're seeing a government that has absolutely [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2412.6200000000003s)]
*  brutalized an entire nation. One of the things you're also seeing is that the government has [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2417.4199999999996s)]
*  realized that it can conduct a lot of its violence through proxies. We just spoke about the Houthis, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2423.18s)]
*  but it's also true that Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah are mere proxies in many ways for [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2429.3399999999997s)]
*  the Iranian state. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2435.66s)]
*  Now, when your earlier role as security minister and other posts, you've had access [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2436.46s)]
*  to a lot of classified information. Of course, we wouldn't ask you to share that with us, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2441.9s)]
*  but could you give us a sense, how much has that changed your view of the world? Is it like you [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2446.94s)]
*  learn all those things and then you say, oh my God, this is how the world works? I never figured [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2450.94s)]
*  that. Or do you just make marginal adjustments based on what you've learned? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2455.42s)]
*  I won't tell you any secrets, but I suppose the one secret that I can tell you that some people [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2461.98s)]
*  just won't believe me is conspiracies are unbelievably difficult and I just don't believe [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2465.6600000000003s)]
*  in them anymore. I believe in cock up. I believe there's huge numbers of mistakes that happen and [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2470.22s)]
*  people are constantly misjudging things that I believe in and that leads to very, very [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2475.3399999999997s)]
*  unpredictable outcomes in some circumstances. But I think the conspiracies, I'm afraid I don't [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2480.7s)]
*  believe in them. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2487.18s)]
*  Taiwan and South Korea rose in per capita income. They became democratic. They're very healthy, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2489.18s)]
*  vital democracies. China did not. Many people thought it would. What's the difference? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2494.7s)]
*  Freedom. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2500.8599999999997s)]
*  But Taiwan and South Korea didn't have freedom. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2502.3799999999997s)]
*  They had enough freedom and the freedom you need is the freedom to be able to hold your own property, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2505.66s)]
*  to know that wealth that you accumulate, you'll be able to keep and that deals you make will be [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2511.1s)]
*  in some way reasonably adjudicated when there's a dispute and Taiwan and South Korea both had that. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2516.3799999999997s)]
*  China has an entirely separate court system. It has an arbitrary wealth removal system, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2522.54s)]
*  to put it nicely. It has a very brutal tyrannical government that runs in a very disjointed way. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2528.06s)]
*  If you're a member of the party, you have one form of court system. If you're not, you have a [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2536.2999999999997s)]
*  different and that has led to massive internal corruption. I don't just mean in the usual sense, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2539.98s)]
*  but corruption in the sense that it's very difficult to predict the ownership of assets [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2547.98s)]
*  in large scale. That's really difficult. It just makes investment for the long term difficult. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2552.8599999999997s)]
*  You saw the arrest of Jack Ma being evidence of that. That was one of those moments where [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2559.8199999999997s)]
*  the wealthy got too big for their boots and were challenging the party and the party will always [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2564.62s)]
*  come first. If we think about Russia for a long time, maybe forever, Russia has not been close to [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2568.62s)]
*  a free country. If you had to try to explain in as most fundamental and conceptual terms as possible [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2576.2999999999997s)]
*  why that is true, how do you understand Russian history? Why has it gone so badly so many times? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2583.1s)]
*  I've read a fair amount of Russian history, but I'm afraid I just simply can't explain it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2590.7799999999997s)]
*  But it consistently goes wrong. I asked myself whether it's to do with the scale of the country, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2595.74s)]
*  whether it's to do with the fact that the levels of education or levels of connection between [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2601.26s)]
*  urban and rural areas are so great. I don't know, but your wife left the Soviet Union, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2607.6600000000003s)]
*  when was it? Yeah, 1992. What would your view be? I find it very difficult to say much about Russia. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2612.38s)]
*  I think it's a mix of size, its neighbors. It had its own version of the Turner thesis [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2621.1000000000004s)]
*  where it expanded, but that made them more brutal rather than giving them outlets to be free. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2627.26s)]
*  Urban-rural imbalance, which you mentioned, partly heritage from a more eastern version of [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2633.26s)]
*  Christianity, maybe is somewhat more authoritarian, never feeling secure, repeatedly having been [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2639.26s)]
*  invaded and almost having lost a number of historically significant times. Being this [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2646.3s)]
*  odd mix of European and Asian and even Muslim cultures mixed together in a way that has never [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2652.78s)]
*  quite had a stable core at its center, so there's always this great fear of losing order. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2658.5400000000004s)]
*  But that's just me. I'm just making that up, right? We can't test these views. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2663.42s)]
*  We can't, but there's a constant fear of chaos in the Russian. As you know, my wife's mother [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2667.34s)]
*  was of a Russian family. The fear of chaos is something that seems to live in a lot of [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2675.26s)]
*  the Russians that we know where they're constantly afraid you're going to lose everything. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2681.42s)]
*  But then, of course, if you look at Russian history, even over the last 100 years, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2685.42s)]
*  the probability of losing everything every 30 or 40 years is quite high. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2688.46s)]
*  In fact, you remind me of a conversation I had with a friend of mine who was an Estonian [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2692.06s)]
*  about 10 years ago who was telling me that they would set up this East Citizenship thing, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2696.3s)]
*  which I don't know if you know about it, but you can become an East Citizen of Estonia. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2700.94s)]
*  The whole of the Estonian public record, everything is now online, every court case, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2705.26s)]
*  every land treaty, everything. Everything's online. They've outsourced their record holding [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2710.3s)]
*  to, I think it's New Zealand, Canada, and Scotland because they're all common law jurisdictions with [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2715.98s)]
*  stable governments. I said, oh, well, that's an extraordinary thing to do. Why have you done that? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2721.1000000000004s)]
*  He said, oh, well, so when the Russians come. I said, what do you mean when? He said, oh, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2725.5s)]
*  they always come. Every 40 years or so, the Russians come and they destroy us. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2730.2200000000003s)]
*  When the Russians come, we want to be a people without a land. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2733.9s)]
*  Should the UK modernize its nuclear deterrent and if so, how? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2736.38s)]
*  Yes, we should. In fact, we're in the process of doing it in various different ways. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2742.94s)]
*  We should be constantly doing it. Forgive me, I'm not going to talk about how. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2748.38s)]
*  Sure. The no first use policy, should Britain ever announce such a thing? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2753.42s)]
*  I don't think that anybody who's ever been [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2759.1s)]
*  been privy to nuclear command change should ever discuss it. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2761.66s)]
*  I have a few questions about the Tom Tugentat production function. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2766.7799999999997s)]
*  What's your favourite novel? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2771.5s)]
*  The Radetzky March. It's fabulous. It's about, have you read it? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2774.46s)]
*  Of course, yeah, Joseph Roth. Wonderful. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2779.58s)]
*  Exactly. It's about the end of a certain world and the beginning of a new one. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2782.14s)]
*  And it's in many ways, it's very mournful. And of course, it's a book about loss. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2788.46s)]
*  It's a book about the end. But it's also a book about novelty and innovation because it's the [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2795.58s)]
*  arrival of things, it's the arrival of the telegram, the arrival of the train, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2801.9s)]
*  the arrival of that modernity and the challenge that that brings. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2805.5s)]
*  What's your favourite movie? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2809.5s)]
*  I have quite a few that I quite like, actually. I've recently watched again [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2810.7s)]
*  Shawshank Redemption, which is just an absolute classic. And it's a classic with the dialogue [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2819.02s)]
*  is amazing. I love The Princess Bride, which is incredibly funny and still has some of the [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2824.06s)]
*  greatest comic lines in the English language. Those are two of my favourites. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2828.8599999999997s)]
*  Do James Bond movies have a future? So to some people, they feel too politically incorrect. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2835.74s)]
*  In the last Bond movie, this is no longer a spoiler. Bond dies at the end. That just seemed [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2841.02s)]
*  wrong to me. What can they do with the franchise to keep it fresh when there's a lot of competition [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2846.14s)]
*  from other spy figures, right? The Bourne movies, many others. What is going to make James Bond [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2851.66s)]
*  distinctive going forward? The brand. I mean, you know this, Tyler, you don't need me to tell you [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2857.18s)]
*  this. But as an economist, the brand matters, right? The brand is your assurance that enough [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2861.98s)]
*  money will be spent on it, that they don't want to devalue it, that the special effects will be [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2866.62s)]
*  good enough, the music will be original enough, the screenwriter will be famous enough, whatever [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2870.7799999999997s)]
*  it is that you're looking for. The actors will be popular enough. It'll all be there because the [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2875.98s)]
*  brand is strong enough. So I don't know who the next Bond is going to be. I'm sure they could be [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2879.8199999999997s)]
*  from any background at all. A little bit like the Doctor Who franchise where the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2885.1s)]
*  Doctor re- there's a, they have a term for it. I can't remember what the term is now, but they [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2890.54s)]
*  reappears in various different human forms. Bond will re-emerge and no doubt another double-O [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2894.46s)]
*  something or other will happen. What did you learn from your father? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2902.54s)]
*  Kindness. What did you learn from your mother? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2910.62s)]
*  The same, actually. The same. So double influence. What's the most underrated Beatles song? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2916.54s)]
*  That's a very good question. I love Hey Jude. Still a fan of that. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2925.42s)]
*  But it may not be underrated, right? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2934.46s)]
*  No, it's not really underrated. I'm trying to think of what- [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2936.38s)]
*  I'm not- [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2939.58s)]
*  I would say You Won't See Me off Rubber Sol is the most underrated, but it's not the best. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2939.9s)]
*  Yeah? It's not the best. The problem is when you say underrated, you immediately go to your [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2944.86s)]
*  favourite one and your favourite one is almost by definition not underrated because you know it [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2950.94s)]
*  very well. So, I don't know. Yeah. Sorry. Not helpful on that one. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2955.9s)]
*  Civil service salaries in the UK, they seem to an American quite low. The cost of living in London [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2964.46s)]
*  by any standard is quite high. How should that problem be addressed? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2970.94s)]
*  Well, there's two ways to address it, aren't there? One of them is to build more homes and [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2975.82s)]
*  the other one is to raise salaries. One's quicker than the other. And actually, the truth is a [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2979.9s)]
*  combination is likely to be necessary because senior civil servant salaries have flatlined [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2984.14s)]
*  largely by which I mean, of course, they've gone down in real terms over 20 or so years. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2990.62s)]
*  And it's, you know, you're asking people to do really important and difficult jobs and the [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=2998.3s)]
*  competition for those jobs is not just the salary, of course, very often you can offer [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3002.7000000000003s)]
*  similar salaries to in the private sector, but it's the interest. That's the real thing [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3008.7799999999997s)]
*  you're offering. And it's one of the things I've noticed actually is that wherever the government [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3013.9s)]
*  is the only, sorry, let me start that again. Whenever the government is the only provider [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3017.74s)]
*  of that service, so intelligence or defence, and you can only really do it properly in government, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3024.86s)]
*  then despite the salary differential, you still get the best people. I mean, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3031.74s)]
*  unquestionably the best people in intelligence work, in security work or working for the state, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3035.1s)]
*  because only working for the state can you truly use all the powers and resources available. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3041.1s)]
*  Whereas in other areas where, you know, you can do logistics for a private company or for a state [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3047.58s)]
*  company, you can do, you know, you can do processing for a private company or a state company, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3052.7799999999997s)]
*  then the competition is much harder. So if a talented young person comes to you [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3057.18s)]
*  and wants you to make the case why they should work in the British Civil Service, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3061.98s)]
*  not at a top job, but mid-level, maybe a higher job later on, what's the case you would make to them? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3065.58s)]
*  You get a lot more responsibility much earlier than I think you probably imagine. You really get [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3072.22s)]
*  an extraordinary breadth of opportunity to take decisions that actually do have really serious [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3078.86s)]
*  influence to shape government policy, and very often to work with some incredibly interesting [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3084.06s)]
*  people. I mean, one of the things that you can do in government that is harder, it's not impossible, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3088.86s)]
*  but it's harder in most companies, is you can change your job every two years and you can go [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3093.98s)]
*  and do things across the range of government in ways that it's very difficult to do across the [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3099.26s)]
*  range of business. So, you know, I know people who've worked in intelligence, who've worked in [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3103.82s)]
*  trade, who've worked abroad, who've worked at home, you know, who've worked in various different [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3107.82s)]
*  things in a career that's lasted, you know, 10 or 15 years. That's not, it's unusual to be quite [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3111.5s)]
*  that broad in reach, but it's certainly not impossible, and that's a remarkable ability to do that. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3116.94s)]
*  And very last question, what led you to enter politics when you did? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3123.18s)]
*  It matters. It just really matters. I'd been a soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan for [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3128.38s)]
*  the best part of 10 years, 15 years. I mean, not full-time in Iraq and Afghanistan, but I've been [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3136.46s)]
*  soldiering for 10 or 15 years, and it was time for me to go and do something else. And if you care [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3141.26s)]
*  about your country and you care about the way in which we're governed, then there's only one place [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3148.38s)]
*  the orders start, and that's with a democracy that's in parliament. And, you know, what I'd seen [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3154.86s)]
*  in the armed forces was young men and women doing the most extraordinary things, demonstrating the [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3160.46s)]
*  most extraordinary courage, serving our country in the most extraordinary way. And I'd seen some [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3164.78s)]
*  amazing leadership, you know, real leaders at every level, leaders at very junior level, 21, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3169.1s)]
*  22-year-old corporals demonstrating real leadership, and the person I worked for, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3173.74s)]
*  the chief of the defence staff, so the most senior general in the British army, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3177.9s)]
*  demonstrating real strategic leadership. And I'd seen that we need to act on it. And so I brought, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3182.14s)]
*  you know, I brought what I thought was the best of that, you know, and I tried to bring some of that [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3189.1s)]
*  to parliament because, you know, there's a lot of people who these days, I know in both of our [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3195.5s)]
*  cultures, because there's a very high respect for the military in the United States and the United [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3201.74s)]
*  Kingdom, there's a lot of people who say, oh, there must be a military answer to this, not just by the [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3205.02s)]
*  use of force, but, you know, you call in a general to fix a problem, because, you know, generals do [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3210.14s)]
*  stuff. And of course, on one level, that's true, that's right. But on another level, it simply [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3214.14s)]
*  cannot be right that the only way to help disadvantaged kids is for them to join the [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3219.74s)]
*  armed forces or the only way for, you know, young people to have an opportunity from a certain area [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3225.18s)]
*  is to join the armed forces. But time and again, the young men and women I was working with had a [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3229.18s)]
*  brother or a sister or a parent who was unbelievably disadvantaged and just couldn't get a way out of [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3233.5s)]
*  it. And they'd got out of it through the military. But again, that can't be the only way out of it. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3238.9399999999996s)]
*  And so I got into politics because I think there, you've got to find a better way of fixing things, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3243.2599999999998s)]
*  you've got to find a better way out of these things, you've got to find a better way of [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3248.22s)]
*  solving these problems. And I think a military attitude helps because it's an attitude of [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3251.18s)]
*  building a team and delivering and it's an attitude that seeks to respect and support leadership. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3258.2999999999997s)]
*  And offering that leadership, I think, is what matters. And that's why I'm standing as well, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3265.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm standing because I think if you want to serve your country, if you want to offer leadership [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3269.1s)]
*  at a moment when frankly, the world is deeply uncertain and the challenges at home [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3273.18s)]
*  have underinvestment over 30, 40 years have never been more obvious. The need to act in [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3278.62s)]
*  the national interest has never been stronger. And that's, you know, that's what I think we need out [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3284.06s)]
*  of British politics today. Tom Tugentot, thank you very much. Thanks, Tyler. It's good to see you again. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMw4hn6RF50&t=3288.14s)]
