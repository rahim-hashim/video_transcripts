In their conversation, she and Tyler cover her illustrious tennis career, her experience defecting from Czechoslovakia and later becoming a dual citizen, the wage gap in tennis competition and commentary, gender stereotypes in sports, her work regimen and training schedule, technological progress in tennis, her need for speed, journaling and constant self-improvement, some of her most shocking realizations about American life, the best way to see East Africa, her struggle to get her children to put the dishes in the dishwasher, and more.

# Martina Navratilova on Shaping Herself (Live at Mason) | Conversations with Tyler

*  visit conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=19.84s)]
*  Martina, we are greatly honored to have you here today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=30.0s)]
*  You have won Wimbledon nine times, I believe. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=37.8s)]
*  And more astonishing yet, there are, I believe, 80 different events where you have won both [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=41.32s)]
*  the singles and the doubles of the same event. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=45.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  80 times. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  They just gave a million-dollar bonus last week in Indian Wells if a player could win [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  both singles and doubles. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=56.8s)]
*  They didn't do that in my day, unfortunately. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=57.959999999999994s)]
*  If we were to take your achievements, and rather than framing them as sports achievements [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  and athletic, which of course they were, but to think of them in terms of both education, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  self-education, and management, how would you describe the approach that took you, you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=69.24s)]
*  know, by the early 80s to really being a completely dominant player? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=74.64s)]
*  You were a contender, and then you became completely dominant, say, by 1981. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  How did you do that, and what can you teach us about that process? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=81.52s)]
*  Well, I didn't graduate from high school, so I'm having a hard time understanding your [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=84.12s)]
*  question. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=87.0s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=88.0s)]
*  I left my country before I was able to graduate. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=89.0s)]
*  No, I think what happened was kind of a seminal moment. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=92.28s)]
*  I was friends with Nancy Lieberman, who is a basketball player, Hall of Famer, and that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  spring she traveled with me, and I had a bad spring. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=102.4s)]
*  I lost semifinals at the French Open. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=106.32s)]
*  I lost semifinals, both lead-up tournaments to Wimbledon and at Wimbledon, and I always [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=108.56s)]
*  said I would play until I'm 30 and then see. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=114.0s)]
*  And she said, you know, your time's running out, and you could work a lot harder. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=116.56s)]
*  I'm like, what are you talking about? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=120.84s)]
*  I thought I worked pretty hard, but I didn't have a coach for six years after I defected. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  My dad was my coach, and I didn't have a coach. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  I thought I worked hard enough, but then she introduced me to running suicides on the basketball [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=128.16s)]
*  court. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=132.36s)]
*  Why did she register with you in a way earlier people hadn't? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Athlete. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=137.04s)]
*  Athlete. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=138.04s)]
*  Fellow athlete, very, very, I mean, very capable athlete. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=139.04s)]
*  And she just said, you know, you're wasting your time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=141.56s)]
*  You have so much more talent than what you're putting out there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=143.36s)]
*  I just didn't know any better. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=146.52s)]
*  And so we started training that summer. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=148.08s)]
*  Then I got a guy who was also a nutritionist. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=150.16s)]
*  Then he helped me tailor my diet. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=154.36s)]
*  It wasn't to lose weight, but just to have better quality food coming in. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=156.4s)]
*  And because I weighed the same since about 77, 147 pounds. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=160.84s)]
*  And so I didn't lose any weight, but I put on some muscle and lost some body fat. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=165.6s)]
*  And most of all, got a coach. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=171.56s)]
*  Dr. Rene Richards started coaching me. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=173.28s)]
*  I was doing it on my own. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=175.08s)]
*  And everybody that lived here or other players that would have a coach in their hometown, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  Chris Everett had a father, did not travel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  But when she goes home, she would have a coach. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=183.8s)]
*  I would go home and I was alone. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=185.56s)]
*  I was in fact, just last week in Indian Wells, I saw a guy that I used to practice with every [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  day. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=191.52s)]
*  And when I was practicing in Dallas, I did not have a coach. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=192.52s)]
*  So it just didn't occur to me to get a full time coach. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=195.72000000000003s)]
*  And Rene just by accident, we started practicing together at the US Open. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  Building the team, it's sometimes been called Team Navratilova. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=203.56s)]
*  Did you do this self consciously or it's just something that evolved? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Bit by bit, each piece seemed to work. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=209.08s)]
*  And then at the end, did you realize what you had done or what was the process exposed [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=211.44s)]
*  of looking back and reconstructing? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=215.16s)]
*  Well, I just wanted to leave no stone unturned really. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=216.56s)]
*  So the coach obviously was technique and tactics. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=221.16s)]
*  And the physical part was training, working very hard. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=224.72s)]
*  I'll give you my typical day in a minute. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=228.36s)]
*  And then the eating was so that I could train hard and not get injured. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=230.88s)]
*  So it all came together. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=235.24s)]
*  And the typical day then when I really was humming was four hours of tennis, like 10 [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=237.64s)]
*  to 2, two hours of drills and maybe two hours of sets. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=243.92s)]
*  Then I would do some running drills on the court for 15, 20 minutes sprints that if I [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=248.28s)]
*  did them now, I wouldn't be able to walk the next day. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=253.48s)]
*  You know, 15 to 30 second sprinting drills. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=256.12s)]
*  And then we would eat lunch. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=259.48s)]
*  And I would go either play basketball, full court, two on two for an hour and a half or [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=261.12s)]
*  little man, big man, two on one. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=266.12s)]
*  I don't know those people that play basketball. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=267.92s)]
*  You just run. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=270.16s)]
*  Which were you? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=271.16s)]
*  Just run. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=272.16s)]
*  Well, it switches. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=273.16s)]
*  Whoever has the ball, little man. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=274.16s)]
*  No, whoever has the ball is one against two. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=276.72s)]
*  And then you play little man. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=279.38s)]
*  The person plays defense and then the big man plays center. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=280.38s)]
*  So it's not two on one. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=283.74s)]
*  It's one against one and then one. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  And then whoever gets the ball goes the other way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  So it's run, run, run. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=288.64s)]
*  And then I would lift weights and have dinner either before lifting weights or after. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=290.96s)]
*  So it was a full day of training. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=295.06s)]
*  What about 9am to 10am? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  That was breakfast. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=300.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=301.12s)]
*  And if I didn't play basketball, we'd go on the track and run some days 10, 10, 100 meter [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=302.12s)]
*  sprints or, you know, 20, 60, 60 yard sprints. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=305.88s)]
*  I would do four quarters. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=310.2s)]
*  That was my least favorite. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=311.86s)]
*  Yeah, it was. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=313.24s)]
*  I trained hard. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=314.24s)]
*  I worked. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=315.24s)]
*  I worked harder than I needed to, I think. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=316.24s)]
*  But it worked. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=318.16s)]
*  So you've done other things in life. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=320.22s)]
*  You've been very interested in woodworking. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=321.66s)]
*  I've read that you learned Swahili. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=323.6s)]
*  You have a pilot's license. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=325.6s)]
*  You wrote three detective novels, played on a hockey team. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  You're now, I think, having a role in raising two children. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=331.36s)]
*  Have you used a training regime for all of those? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=335.16s)]
*  Do you now think about getting things done this way? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=337.56s)]
*  Well, the positive attitude helps with tennis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=340.8s)]
*  You have to be very positive and have a very short memory, long memory for the good stuff [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=344.22s)]
*  and short memory for the bad stuff. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=349.22s)]
*  Because you have to play a point. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=350.98s)]
*  And in 20 seconds, you've got to get ready for the next point. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=351.98s)]
*  So you've got to analyze what happened and try to do it better, et cetera. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  But raising two kids is challenging. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=358.86s)]
*  I must say, whatever training I've done is not enough. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=361.06s)]
*  Billie Jean King once suggested that you use writing in a journal every day to help you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  accomplish your goals. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=370.42s)]
*  How does that work for you and what is it you do? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=371.88000000000005s)]
*  And why do you think it works? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=373.7s)]
*  Well, it worked because it really kind of centers you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=374.7s)]
*  It narrows it down. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=378.46s)]
*  Whatever long term goal you have, it becomes more real and more current because it narrows [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=380.02s)]
*  it down in that what do you need to do today? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=387.5s)]
*  And did you accomplish that goal? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=389.78s)]
*  So you really have a big goal and then you break it into smaller goals and to smaller [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=391.18s)]
*  goals until you get into, OK, what do I do today to get to that goal? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=395.06s)]
*  And then you keep track. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=399.78s)]
*  It's easier to keep track. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=400.82s)]
*  It's always good to keep track. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=401.82s)]
*  Whether you're playing points, keeping track that way or just measure your progress or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=402.94s)]
*  maybe regress some days. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=407.42s)]
*  And I would rate myself on a physical level, emotional and mental, you know, how I did [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=409.42s)]
*  today on a scale of one to ten. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=413.64s)]
*  And some days were ten, some days were seven, some days were threes. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=416.42s)]
*  Try to be honest with yourself. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  Be honest, but also be nice to yourself. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=421.2s)]
*  And you see that with most champions, they're perfectionists and you beat yourself up too [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=423.46s)]
*  much. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=427.78s)]
*  And so I preach and I try to strive for excellence rather than perfection, because perfection [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=429.06s)]
*  just if you strive for excellence, perfection may happen, but just it's good enough to be [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=434.38s)]
*  excellent. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=439.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's good enough. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=440.42s)]
*  You don't need to be perfect because perfection is kind of just happens by accident. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=441.42s)]
*  John McEnroe once reported that Bjorn Borg said that to him, I quote, number one is the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=445.86s)]
*  only thing that matters. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=451.06s)]
*  That doesn't seem to quite be your attitude. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=452.82s)]
*  But how do you think of your motivation in terms of the goal? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I wanted to be number one. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=457.97999999999996s)]
*  I've said that when I was 20 years old. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=459.78s)]
*  I said since I was eight or nine years old, I wanted to win Mumbleton. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=462.38s)]
*  But by that point, you don't know how big the world is and what that all means. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=466.09999999999997s)]
*  But that was the goal. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=469.06s)]
*  And I just put it out on the line. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=471.06s)]
*  And what was the question? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=473.34s)]
*  Bjorn Borg saying number one is the only thing that matters. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=476.34s)]
*  He may have been exaggerating himself. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=478.97999999999996s)]
*  But do you ever feel you have that attitude that anything short of number one is a kind [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=480.94s)]
*  of failure? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=486.09999999999997s)]
*  The only failure is to not try. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=487.1s)]
*  So for me, it was always giving my best, whatever it was that I was doing, whether it was riding [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=488.70000000000005s)]
*  the bicycle around my garden and trying to go as fast as I can and timing myself. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=493.1s)]
*  I got my first watch was a stopwatch when I was in third grade. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=497.06s)]
*  So I was always timing myself and I would try to go faster. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=501.02000000000004s)]
*  So I would kind of pack up, you know, do a little turn so I could make the turn faster [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=503.58000000000004s)]
*  so I could go faster three times around competing with myself. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=508.66s)]
*  My competition was always with myself. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=511.94s)]
*  I always said I would rather play well and lose than play lousy and win. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=513.9399999999999s)]
*  Because if I play lousy and won, that just meant my opponent was really lousy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=518.02s)]
*  So I'd rather be pushed. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=521.78s)]
*  And so that's why I really enjoy the competition against the best players, because that's when [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=524.18s)]
*  you have to put it on the line and play your best. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=527.48s)]
*  Anything less won't be good enough. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=530.74s)]
*  The number one kind of happened. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=532.5s)]
*  But that's another line that I use. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=533.74s)]
*  Everybody has that goal. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=537.62s)]
*  Most players that play on the tour, they want to be number one. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=538.78s)]
*  They want to win a major. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=540.78s)]
*  But only one person can be number one. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=542.9s)]
*  So does that make everybody else a failure? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=544.8199999999999s)]
*  No, they're trying their hardest. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=546.6999999999999s)]
*  And if you try your best and the best that you can do, which we have the ranking, obviously [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=548.66s)]
*  that's very, it doesn't lie. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=554.2199999999999s)]
*  This is exactly where you stand. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  You could be 45 in the world or five in the world or number one. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=557.18s)]
*  If you try your best and your best ranking ever was number 10, then that's as, you know, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=560.06s)]
*  the other nine players are better. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=566.62s)]
*  But if the other nine people weren't alive, you'd be number one. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=568.0999999999999s)]
*  So, but you're still the same tennis player, right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=572.54s)]
*  You're not any better. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  So for me, the competition was always with myself. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=577.38s)]
*  Pam Schreiver once said that she thought her doubles partnership with you worked so well, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=581.0999999999999s)]
*  precisely because the two of you had this creative interchange, but you didn't spend [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=585.9799999999999s)]
*  much time together off the court. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=589.9s)]
*  So you saved that back and forth for when you were playing together. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=591.74s)]
*  Does that make sense to you? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=594.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, we talked a lot. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=595.9s)]
*  Yes, we had to catch up on everything while we're playing the matches. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=596.9s)]
*  Nowadays, they all talk strategy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=601.06s)]
*  We're like, OK, I serve wide, but, you know, what do you want to do for dinner? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=602.54s)]
*  Or where did you go last time? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=607.06s)]
*  And where is your couch sitting? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=608.26s)]
*  And we were visiting him. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  Can you believe that guy over there? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=611.14s)]
*  You know, he's not even watching us. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=612.54s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=614.62s)]
*  We were just talking. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=615.3s)]
*  We were just talking smack and we had fun. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=616.34s)]
*  We had fun. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=619.06s)]
*  A few questions about women's tennis in particular. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=619.98s)]
*  If you think about Steffi Graf, Sabatini, Monica Seles, Hingis yourself, do women in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=622.5799999999999s)]
*  tennis develop more quickly in terms of age? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=627.74s)]
*  And if so, why is that the case? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=630.66s)]
*  Well, physically, I mean, women mature earlier, I think emotionally and physically, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=632.1s)]
*  but most of all physically nowadays, again, the game has gotten so much more physical. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=636.3s)]
*  It's a little more tricky for for people to play really great tennis at 14 or 15. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=640.58s)]
*  And in the women's game, we instituted age eligibility rules. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=645.86s)]
*  So you don't you cannot play a full full time. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=649.66s)]
*  You cannot play as many tournaments as you want to. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=652.14s)]
*  There is a limit to to to how many tournaments you can play at 14 and 15, etc. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=655.02s)]
*  It goes up. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=659.98s)]
*  And the biggest reason for that was we had too many injuries and too many people getting [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=661.26s)]
*  burned out because the parents had these big eyes for their kids and they're pulling kids [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=664.5s)]
*  out of school too soon and doing training and and burning out physically or emotionally [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=669.4200000000001s)]
*  before they even get on the tour. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=675.26s)]
*  Or if they get on the tour, then the injuries come. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=676.5400000000001s)]
*  Too many too many people pulling out. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=678.78s)]
*  But I think some of it is also they don't make them like they used to. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=681.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in the old days, I would come to a tournament and they saw a default. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=686.1s)]
*  There was a default. Somebody would default. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=690.02s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God, is she OK? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=691.5s)]
*  She's in the hospital. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=692.66s)]
*  It was unusual for people to pull out. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=694.66s)]
*  I think Chris pulled out of like three events ever. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=696.9s)]
*  Same with me. Three tournaments that I pulled out of. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=699.06s)]
*  And you played a lot. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=701.5799999999999s)]
*  And I played a lot of tournaments, a lot of matches. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=702.54s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how many singles I won, but I think I played something [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=705.06s)]
*  like 1700 singles matches and like thousand, I don't know, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=708.42s)]
*  1100 doubles matches. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=713.1s)]
*  So what accounts for that change? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=715.22s)]
*  Why are we moderns? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=716.86s)]
*  Weaker, more complacent, however you might describe it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=719.82s)]
*  I mean, what's happened? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=723.62s)]
*  Well, things are easier. There's no doubt. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=724.38s)]
*  But also they're lasting longer because things are easier and better. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=725.98s)]
*  The trainers, you have trainers now. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=729.46s)]
*  When I came on the tour, I pulled a stomach muscle [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=731.26s)]
*  of very first term and I played and it took two months before I got well again. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=733.46s)]
*  Seventy five, we got a trainer for the first time on the tour in 1975. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=738.3s)]
*  And I thought, oh, you get a massage. No, no, no. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=742.38s)]
*  This is a trainer. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=744.46s)]
*  They actually like take your ankles and stuff. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=745.1800000000001s)]
*  We were really clueless. We didn't know. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=747.26s)]
*  So nowadays the care is much better. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=749.54s)]
*  And, you know, the players last longer because of that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=751.46s)]
*  But we played on clay or grass indoors on on soft carpet [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=754.38s)]
*  with wooden rackets, with gut animal gut with the strings. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=762.02s)]
*  Now they play on hard course most of the time with metal rackets, with nylon strings. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=767.38s)]
*  So the body does not absorb that vibration from the racket. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=772.3399999999999s)]
*  They use their wrists a lot more. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=776.6199999999999s)]
*  So you have a lot more injuries on the upper body. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=778.3399999999999s)]
*  And then playing on hard courts, you see them slide. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=781.14s)]
*  I'm like, I still don't know how they do that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=783.5s)]
*  And sliding on hard courts like, oh, it's just, you know, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  there'll be a lot more hip replacements in the future because of that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=787.4599999999999s)]
*  And and I think it's just the game is more physical. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=791.9s)]
*  So they they get more beat up. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=794.78s)]
*  Everybody's hitting the ball harder because of the rackets, et cetera. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=796.74s)]
*  Some sports, it seems fairly easy to compare the past and the present. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=799.74s)]
*  So the 100 meter dash, how long did it take? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=803.46s)]
*  There's a very definite timing. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=805.82s)]
*  If you're thinking about tennis players, the best of today, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=807.42s)]
*  the best of an earlier age, you know, Althea Gibson or Yvonne Goulaghan, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=810.26s)]
*  whoever it is you have in mind. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=814.62s)]
*  Do you think it's even a meaningful comparison or do you have some definite view [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=816.1800000000001s)]
*  like we were better than they'll ever be or they, you know, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=819.66s)]
*  they would take every set from us? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=822.86s)]
*  How do you think about that problem? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=824.14s)]
*  Me from 1990 would have beaten me from 1980, would have beaten me from 1973 [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=825.38s)]
*  because you get better as you play. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=829.9399999999999s)]
*  And I would have beaten Althea Gibson. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=831.74s)]
*  But then if I had been born in Althea Gibson's time and Althea Gibson [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=833.7s)]
*  was born 20 years later, she would be beating me because it's the evolution [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=837.3s)]
*  of the sport and nowadays, especially with the rackets being so different. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=841.1s)]
*  You can't really compare. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=845.74s)]
*  But if Yvonne Goulaghan was born now, she would still be [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=846.82s)]
*  she would still be winning majors. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=849.46s)]
*  Same same with the with the guys. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=851.34s)]
*  I mean, you're a product of your of your culture and of your time. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=853.14s)]
*  You know, if Usain Bolt was born in 1930, I'm pretty sure he would not be running [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=857.4200000000001s)]
*  nine point two, whatever he's running, 100 meters, you know, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=861.4200000000001s)]
*  just wasn't going to happen with those shoes on those tracks. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=864.58s)]
*  It's a different ballgame. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=868.14s)]
*  If you think about how men and women are divided in tennis, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=870.02s)]
*  the current arrangement has a lot of advantages, but it could be the case. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=874.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm no expert in this area, but that there are more than two genders [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=879.3000000000001s)]
*  and say in track and field, you have Casters Semenya where people, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=882.34s)]
*  you know, argue, should she be allowed to compete in women's track and field? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=886.1s)]
*  There's a lot of measurement that goes on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=891.02s)]
*  Arguably, it's somewhat intrusive or just tasteful. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=892.78s)]
*  And how should we think about this problem and structure the rules [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=897.3s)]
*  going forward to have the best available arrangement? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=900.54s)]
*  You just try to take it case by case and make it as fair as possible [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=903.42s)]
*  for everybody involved. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=906.9s)]
*  I'm not a doctor, so I can't really. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=908.42s)]
*  It's hard to pin that one, but you just try to make it fair. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=911.38s)]
*  And there is not any particular rule, because if you go by that, then, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=914.1800000000001s)]
*  you know, some guy may have a lot more testosterone than another guy. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=918.86s)]
*  And then what is he banned because he has too much. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=921.34s)]
*  You know, where do you put the limits? Who decides where the limits are? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=923.26s)]
*  So you just take it case by case and try to be as far as make it [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=926.4200000000001s)]
*  a level playing field. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=930.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean, with me, they were saying I have an advantage because I'm gay. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=931.5400000000001s)]
*  It's like somehow, you know, a gay player hits the ball [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=934.1800000000001s)]
*  better than a straight player. I don't know. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=937.7800000000001s)]
*  Still trying to figure that one out. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=941.58s)]
*  Issues of pay equity. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=944.22s)]
*  As you know, Australian, US, French Open, Dwymbelton, Indian, Wales, Miami, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=945.62s)]
*  male and female prizes are the same at the top at many other tournaments. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=949.98s)]
*  Male winners tend to receive quite a bit more than female winners. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=953.7s)]
*  Is this, in your view, fair? Should it be changed? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=957.4200000000001s)]
*  And if so, how should we change it? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=959.7s)]
*  Well, we are changing it a little bit at a time, but still, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=960.94s)]
*  those tournaments are separate. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=964.14s)]
*  So the men still most corporations run by men, owned by men. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=965.5s)]
*  And they're much more likely to give the money to the men than the women, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=970.4599999999999s)]
*  whether it's a bank or a whatever the sponsor is. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=974.6999999999999s)]
*  Men have a much easier time getting the sponsorship money [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=978.2199999999999s)]
*  and don't have to don't have to prove it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=981.6999999999999s)]
*  The women have to prove themselves, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=984.42s)]
*  which is why most of the sponsors that have been involved in women's sport, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=985.78s)]
*  women's women's tennis have stayed around a lot longer because we have to [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=989.0999999999999s)]
*  we have to make sure that the money is is judged correct, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=993.42s)]
*  that economically it makes sense. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=996.66s)]
*  I mean, the NFL, how many false starts were there for the NFL, NBA, all of that? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=999.02s)]
*  You have one false start in the women's league and all the women can't make it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1002.98s)]
*  But the guys, they keep throwing money at them. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1006.02s)]
*  And so it is still in different cultures. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1008.1s)]
*  I mean, we still have tournaments in places where women can't, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1010.5s)]
*  you know, walk without a man, man, male score. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1012.86s)]
*  So times have changed, but not enough. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1014.74s)]
*  But it's certainly going the right direction. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1017.1s)]
*  So but the pay inequity is still there. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1019.26s)]
*  Male and female tennis announcers, should they be paying the same? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1021.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trending on Twitter today. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1025.1s)]
*  My claim to fame. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1028.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you try to pay people equal amount for equal work, equal contribution [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1030.74s)]
*  and equal level of expertise and championship quality. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1036.62s)]
*  You want to assign to that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1040.78s)]
*  But so there's this hoo-ha right now about me not getting me getting a lot less paid [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1042.82s)]
*  for the same work that as John McEnroe at the at Wimbledon, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1048.8999999999999s)]
*  which the BBC is a publicly owned corporation, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1054.3s)]
*  but they would not divulge what people are making. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1057.74s)]
*  Finally, they had to last year say how much people are making. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1059.58s)]
*  Only people are making hundred fifty thousand pounds a year or more. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1063.34s)]
*  Anybody less than that, you don't have to divulge. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1067.1s)]
*  So a lot of the part time people did not make the cut. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1069.18s)]
*  But John McEnroe did make the cut. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1071.5s)]
*  He gets at least hundred fifty thousand pounds for Wimbledon [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1073.02s)]
*  while I was getting paid about 12, 13 thousand pounds for less work. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1075.78s)]
*  Less work. Yes. But about maybe one third. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1080.06s)]
*  That's because I couldn't get any more. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1083.5s)]
*  I wanted to work more. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1084.7s)]
*  But we were getting all kinds of all kinds of excuses [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1086.18s)]
*  why I couldn't get more or other women weren't getting paid as much as the men. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1090.5800000000002s)]
*  I knew I was getting paid less, but I didn't know how much less. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1094.5800000000002s)]
*  And then when I found out when this report was made public, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1097.1000000000001s)]
*  it's like, OK, now this is not just, you know, percentage. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1100.6200000000001s)]
*  This is a multiplier. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1103.78s)]
*  There was a program that just went out tonight, actually, at [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1105.5800000000002s)]
*  it's kind of the 60 minutes in the UK called Panorama. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1108.22s)]
*  And I did an interview there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1111.1000000000001s)]
*  So now there's a big, big to do about it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1113.5800000000002s)]
*  And it's not between me and McEnroe. It's not about that. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1115.62s)]
*  It's about women getting paid a lot less than men for a similar job. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1118.78s)]
*  So, you know, maybe maybe it's because you get paid by the word [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1122.78s)]
*  because I try to keep my answers really succinct. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1126.8999999999999s)]
*  So. Just saying. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1130.78s)]
*  Here's something Billie Jean King once said, and I'm not sure, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1136.62s)]
*  but I think she was referring to both men's and women's tennis. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1139.34s)]
*  Quote, I think tennis is a sexy sport and that is good. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1142.26s)]
*  The players are young with excellent bodies, clothed in relatively little. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1145.94s)]
*  It offers the healthiest, most appealing presentation of sex I can imagine. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1149.98s)]
*  And we in sport must acknowledge that and use it to our advantage. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1154.06s)]
*  True or false? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1157.7s)]
*  She said that it's in print. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1159.62s)]
*  Then it's not like Billy. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1161.98s)]
*  Well, I never heard her say that, but it is as well. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1163.58s)]
*  It is sexy sport, but I don't think it's because of the way we dress. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1166.66s)]
*  It's just because we're really capable. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1169.98s)]
*  Of of hitting the tennis ball and doing things on the court that most people. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1172.58s)]
*  And it's a cognitive endeavor, most of all. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1176.7s)]
*  And and and it's also makes sense to play tennis and, you know, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1178.62s)]
*  shorts and or a shorter skirt rather than what Susan Longman used to have to put up [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1182.22s)]
*  with with the long dresses, etc. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1186.14s)]
*  I think the form follows function on the on the tennis clothing anyway. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1188.34s)]
*  But there's nothing wrong with being sexy as long as it's not. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1192.7s)]
*  It's not sexist. You know, here's a question. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1196.74s)]
*  I mean, I mean, guys, guys get paid more if they're good looking. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1200.58s)]
*  They get more endorsements. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1203.26s)]
*  Women, same thing. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1204.46s)]
*  But then it becomes too disparate. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1205.5s)]
*  Then that's when it becomes a problem when you have to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1208.4199999999998s)]
*  when you have to be sexy in order to be paid the same. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1211.1399999999999s)]
*  The guy doesn't have to be sexy. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1215.3s)]
*  I mean, look at the TV people. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1216.78s)]
*  Right. Here's a question from a reader. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1219.5s)]
*  And I quote, in her autobiography, Martina observed that U.S. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1223.9399999999998s)]
*  women such as Chris Everett had to conform to far more rigid gender [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1227.9s)]
*  stereotypes than Czech women like she did. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1231.5s)]
*  Does Martina still believe that U.S. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1234.3000000000002s)]
*  gender stereotypes are a lot more constricting and universally [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1236.02s)]
*  imposed in America today than in, say, Central Europe? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1239.5s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1243.22s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1244.18s)]
*  I said that a long time ago. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1245.3400000000001s)]
*  That biography came out 30 years ago. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1246.5800000000002s)]
*  So I really don't remember what all I said once in a while. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1248.46s)]
*  I signed it and I look inside. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1252.3400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God, I can't believe I said that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1253.8600000000001s)]
*  This is way too personal. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1256.54s)]
*  But the one thing growing up in a communist country, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1258.26s)]
*  perhaps the only good thing about it was that it was OK to be a female athlete. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1260.7s)]
*  Women were or anything really. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1265.22s)]
*  There were women doctors, professors, very common, not not in the political scene. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1267.34s)]
*  There was always guys for some reason. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1271.74s)]
*  But every other field, women were just as encouraged to go into that field as men. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1274.02s)]
*  There was no, oh, well, you want to study, be an electrician. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1278.78s)]
*  You have to be a man now or a professor, whatever. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1281.74s)]
*  It all works. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1284.62s)]
*  So when somebody said doctor, you didn't assume it was a man, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1285.74s)]
*  whereas it was an assumption here. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1288.7s)]
*  I still make the mistake myself. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1290.54s)]
*  And so being an athlete, I was encouraged to be an athlete [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1292.54s)]
*  and to do to the best. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1296.5s)]
*  It wasn't like I had to be begging to to be able to play tennis [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1298.06s)]
*  because, you know, it's only for boys. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1300.9s)]
*  So same with the clothing. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1303.5s)]
*  Maybe maybe we weren't dressing so sexy because there just wasn't anything [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1305.26s)]
*  sexy to be bought there. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1308.7s)]
*  You know, you just kind of went to the store and see what was available. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1311.18s)]
*  But I think Chris was just conforming, not because of any preconceived ideas, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1314.6599999999999s)]
*  but she came from a good Catholic family and she wanted to please her parents. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1319.06s)]
*  So it was more that than I think any American culture. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1322.06s)]
*  It was actually more cultural within within the family, how you grew up [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1325.1799999999998s)]
*  at the top level. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1329.34s)]
*  Why has U.S. men's tennis collapsed? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1330.26s)]
*  I don't think it's collapsed. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1332.5s)]
*  I think we have the last grand slam winner. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1333.6999999999998s)]
*  Who is it? Is it Andy Roddick? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1336.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1337.74s)]
*  A long time ago. I think it's Andy. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1338.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, there were a few in the finals. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1340.5s)]
*  But right now there's new guys coming up. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1342.34s)]
*  All right. Opelka, who is like six foot ten, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1344.98s)]
*  is huge and huge serve and a good big talent. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1348.06s)]
*  Taylor Fritz had a good tournament last week in Indian Wells. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1351.1799999999998s)]
*  I actually used to play against his mother, Kathy May. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1354.74s)]
*  I think Jack Sock. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1359.82s)]
*  I mean, he made the he made the Masters. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1362.26s)]
*  I mean, on a given day, they can beat anybody, but to win a major, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1364.1s)]
*  that takes that takes a lot. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1367.4199999999998s)]
*  But it always goes in in ebbs and flows. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1368.58s)]
*  And fluctuations. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1371.3s)]
*  But I think the biggest thing is that the rest of the world caught up. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1373.22s)]
*  It's not that we're bad. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1375.94s)]
*  It's the rest of all is better. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1376.8999999999999s)]
*  It's a lot more international than this is a lot more global. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1378.26s)]
*  And and and, you know, the tennis ball doesn't know where you're from, does it? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1381.02s)]
*  The NBA, the NFL and Major League Baseball, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1385.82s)]
*  they've all been revolutionized by analytics and statistics. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1388.86s)]
*  But tennis so far, not that much. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1392.3s)]
*  As far as I can tell, you may know better. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1393.82s)]
*  Is this coming to tennis? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1395.82s)]
*  And if so, what kind of effect is it? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1397.18s)]
*  No, it's there now. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1398.6599999999999s)]
*  The knowledge is there. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1400.26s)]
*  I think it's still people are figuring out how to how to use it to their advantage. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1401.18s)]
*  But they have all kinds of statistics now with the Hawkeye. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1405.34s)]
*  When you play matches, they even have cameras on practice courts. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1409.18s)]
*  You can measure how many revolutions per per shot, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1412.02s)]
*  where it landed, how many mistakes you made. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1415.78s)]
*  It can get too much, but you can certainly use it to your advantage [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1417.74s)]
*  to see where the weaknesses are. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1422.02s)]
*  It's very obvious where the strengths are, where the opponents, etc. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1423.5s)]
*  I think would help in making game plans and all that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1426.78s)]
*  But ultimately, you can analyze all you want, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1429.34s)]
*  but ultimately, you just got to hit the damn ball [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1431.62s)]
*  and hit it well. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1435.3799999999999s)]
*  Are the rules of tennis flawed in some way? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1437.34s)]
*  Are games too long or competitions too long or too short? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1439.66s)]
*  Is there too much or too little regulation of string and racket technology? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1443.26s)]
*  Would you change the scoring system? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  Can you improve on what we have? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1448.58s)]
*  That's a lot of questions. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1449.86s)]
*  Other than the pay. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1450.7s)]
*  I have one question at a time, please. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1453.26s)]
*  Regulations, absolutely. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1456.1s)]
*  The rackets have taken over the sport and the strings. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1457.5s)]
*  The strings, when you when you put them on a microscope, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1460.1s)]
*  they like have these little teeth, so they bite the ball. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1462.54s)]
*  So you can put a lot more spin on the ball, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1464.46s)]
*  which makes it a lot easier to hit it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1466.58s)]
*  The rackets, the sweet spot used to be about this big. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1468.14s)]
*  Now it's like this big. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1470.7s)]
*  As long as you don't hit the frame, you're good to go. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1472.02s)]
*  So it's very forgiving. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1474.38s)]
*  And so everybody hits a much better ball. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1475.86s)]
*  And it's more difficult to come to the net because because it's easier [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1478.3s)]
*  to dip the ball with the spin, etc. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1481.46s)]
*  So the racket manufacturers have really changed the sport too much [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1483.78s)]
*  in in my mind, you don't see as much variety because of the of the equipment [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1486.98s)]
*  really favoring the the baselines or the groundstrokes over the volleys. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1492.06s)]
*  And top players today, they don't have to be as smart as in your time. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1496.46s)]
*  Oh, it's well, I don't know. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1500.1s)]
*  But it sounds like more strength oriented. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1503.22s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1505.02s)]
*  Less cognitive. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1505.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's it can be. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1506.54s)]
*  You can you can you can get by with less sort of lower tennis IQ. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1507.5s)]
*  You know, if you can power pass people, you don't have to hit around [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1511.8600000000001s)]
*  and you go through them. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1515.1s)]
*  Yeah, the rackets are more forgiving. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1516.34s)]
*  It's like having much more horsepower. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1517.8999999999999s)]
*  You know, you just step on the gas and off you go. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1519.82s)]
*  So technique is not as as prevalent and tactics. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1522.6599999999999s)]
*  Although now you find different parts of the court because of the strings [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1527.1799999999998s)]
*  also because of the rackets, which makes it different. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1530.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's just different. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1533.86s)]
*  It's not necessarily better or worse, but I think less variety. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1534.62s)]
*  And that's what I'm missing. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1537.1s)]
*  But yeah, mixed doubles also seems less popular, right? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1538.4599999999998s)]
*  And is that another example of declining interest in? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1542.4599999999998s)]
*  Well, I think there is so much more money in singles [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1545.3799999999999s)]
*  and so much interest in singles. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1547.9399999999998s)]
*  Fewer players play singles and doubles. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1549.34s)]
*  So because, you know, you win one major and your your life is made. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1551.1799999999998s)]
*  So you don't concentrate so much on you don't want to make anything [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1556.1399999999999s)]
*  hamper that possibility. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1560.3799999999999s)]
*  So people play less. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1561.6999999999998s)]
*  I played singles, doubles and mixed in a whole bunch of times. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1562.54s)]
*  In fact, I probably played too much in my 30s. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1565.3799999999999s)]
*  I should have played less, but I didn't know any better. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1567.62s)]
*  And I like playing mixed. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1570.6999999999998s)]
*  Maybe that's one of my other big accomplishments. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1572.02s)]
*  I won the triple in the US Open on this 31. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1574.58s)]
*  I won singles, doubles and mixed one year at one blood on 86. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1576.78s)]
*  It rained so much that only played two matches in the first week [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1580.4199999999998s)]
*  because it rained two singles. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1584.34s)]
*  And then I played 17 matches the second week [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1586.02s)]
*  because I got to the finals of all three. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1588.86s)]
*  So I played two or three matches every single day. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1590.58s)]
*  And then the last one, I we lost the doubles. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1593.62s)]
*  Pam and I lost the doubles. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1596.1799999999998s)]
*  We had lost a match in two years. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1597.34s)]
*  We lost the finals. I won the singles. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1598.54s)]
*  And then Sunday after winning the singles and winning [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1600.26s)]
*  and losing doubles final, I played three. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1603.78s)]
*  We were in the quarterfinals on the mixed doubles on Sunday. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1606.1399999999999s)]
*  I was on the court for six hours [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1608.62s)]
*  because there was no tiebreak in the third set. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1610.66s)]
*  I won the first match in three sets. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1613.02s)]
*  Then we played again, semifinals in three sets. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1614.58s)]
*  Twenty, I think was 23, 21 in the third. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1617.58s)]
*  And then the final was three sets as well. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1620.8999999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, I was tired that day. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1623.26s)]
*  That's why people don't play it because it just takes too much energy. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1625.94s)]
*  The game is more physical and they don't want to hamper anything. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1628.82s)]
*  But I like I like playing tennis so much that I couldn't see not playing doubles. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1631.94s)]
*  If somehow tennis didn't exist or you couldn't have been a tennis player, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1636.66s)]
*  but ended up in this country at a young enough age, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1640.02s)]
*  what do you think would have been your career? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1642.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, if sports or anything else, I don't know. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1644.8600000000001s)]
*  It can be hockey, it can be woodworking. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1649.02s)]
*  I play hockey, woodworking. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1651.46s)]
*  No, that would not. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1652.94s)]
*  No, that I don't think that would have made that much money. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1654.1000000000001s)]
*  But or but I did woodworking. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1656.26s)]
*  I still have ten fingers. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1659.22s)]
*  See, I did pretty well. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1660.1000000000001s)]
*  Made a couple of tables. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1661.8999999999999s)]
*  I think I wanted to be an architect or a builder. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1663.4199999999998s)]
*  I think that's why I got into woodworking when I create. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1666.9399999999998s)]
*  And if it was a sport, either a skier or a race car driver. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1669.4599999999998s)]
*  I like speed. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1675.1799999999998s)]
*  If you look back on your whole career, your whole life, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1677.6999999999998s)]
*  what question do you most frequently ask yourself [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1680.26s)]
*  that you would be willing to share with us? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1683.02s)]
*  Well, recently, OK, I've been married now for three years [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1685.54s)]
*  with Julia, almost 10 years. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1689.1399999999999s)]
*  And her two daughters are 16 and 12. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1690.94s)]
*  And the question I ask myself most most often these days is [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1695.18s)]
*  what can I say to them so that they will actually put the dishes [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1699.54s)]
*  in the dishwasher rather than just leave them in the sink? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1703.6200000000001s)]
*  I have not solved that riddle. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1708.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1711.1000000000001s)]
*  It's, you know, take away the iPhone. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1711.7s)]
*  Now that doesn't work. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1713.26s)]
*  Driving privileges now. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1714.98s)]
*  I don't know. I don't. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1716.5800000000002s)]
*  I've run out being nice. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1717.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, give money. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1719.22s)]
*  I did that, too. I paid him. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1720.7s)]
*  That didn't work either. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1723.38s)]
*  Anybody any suggestions? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1725.18s)]
*  I mean, and the dishwasher is here and the sink is here. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1728.22s)]
*  It's not like it's a long trip, you know, just. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1730.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I come from a home where we didn't have hot water [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1734.5s)]
*  till I was about 12 years old. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1737.02s)]
*  We had to heat up the water to wash the dishes and to heat up [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1738.5800000000002s)]
*  the big thing to take a bath once a week. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1741.66s)]
*  You know, that's all you had. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1744.5s)]
*  We had to heat up the water to wash the dishes. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1745.7s)]
*  And and my mom washed the dishes and I dried them. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1747.78s)]
*  Every night. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1750.46s)]
*  Some questions about gay rights. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1751.58s)]
*  How can we incentivize other celebrities, athletes [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1754.26s)]
*  to come out of the closet more? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1757.26s)]
*  Because there's been a huge positive external benefit [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1758.6200000000001s)]
*  from what you've done. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1761.42s)]
*  Many, many people's lives are much better off and freer [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1762.14s)]
*  and have more dignity. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1764.74s)]
*  But it seems highly likely there are many more gay people in sports [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1766.1000000000001s)]
*  who are unwilling to come out of the closet. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1769.74s)]
*  Even now, didn't you see the Olympics? Adam Rippon? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1771.3400000000001s)]
*  The Olympics, but major league. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1774.54s)]
*  No, but that depends on what sport you're in, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1776.02s)]
*  because it's almost like if you're a figure skater, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1778.82s)]
*  you have to prove that you're straight. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1781.1399999999999s)]
*  If you're a man and if you're a softball player, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1782.4599999999998s)]
*  as a woman, you have to prove that you're straight. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1785.3s)]
*  And it's it's it's it depends on the sport, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1787.34s)]
*  but it's difficult in team sports because if the coach is in any shape [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1789.9799999999998s)]
*  homophobic, you don't get to play. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1793.62s)]
*  You don't get to compete. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1796.8999999999999s)]
*  There was there was a forget her name now. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1797.7399999999998s)]
*  She played for Penn State coach. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1799.9799999999998s)]
*  Anybody can help me. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1802.7399999999998s)]
*  She was a coach there. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1803.82s)]
*  Rini Portland. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1805.1799999999998s)]
*  She openly said, I will not allow a lesbian on my team. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1807.7s)]
*  This is back in the 80s and would proudly proclaim to her parents [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1811.98s)]
*  that there are no lesbians on the team when she was recruiting her players. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1815.86s)]
*  So do you come out? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1818.8999999999999s)]
*  You don't get to play. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1821.3799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, it's it's difficult in team sports or professional sports. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1822.78s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1826.86s)]
*  You would get blackballed by the league if you do the unpopular thing. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1827.46s)]
*  It's OK now. It's better. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1831.78s)]
*  So you're starting in the NBA. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1833.58s)]
*  You're a good player. You have a proven record. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1835.34s)]
*  Very few people in that position have come out. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1837.98s)]
*  You think it's about endorsements or commercial factors or fandom? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1840.1s)]
*  You know, it's because they're not going to bench you the minute after. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1843.34s)]
*  It's privacy. It's your teammates. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1846.22s)]
*  Some may know, some may not. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1848.02s)]
*  I mean, I know, you know, professional team sports. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1849.26s)]
*  There's definitely a lot of players out there that their teammates know, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1852.26s)]
*  but that's still it's still a taboo and it's uncomfortable, you know, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1854.98s)]
*  and it attracts attention in a way that these macho sports don't want. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1858.98s)]
*  Even on the tennis tennis tour, I was lucky that I could come out [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1863.82s)]
*  because I knew I could still play tennis no matter what happened in endorsements. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1867.06s)]
*  I didn't care. You know, I lost a lot of money, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1869.7399999999998s)]
*  but I just wanted to play tennis and be true to myself. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1871.78s)]
*  So I knew I could still play no matter what. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1875.02s)]
*  The ranking is this. You get to play. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1877.54s)]
*  But on team sports, it's tricky. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1879.34s)]
*  So I get that that it's difficult, especially for men. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1880.9799999999998s)]
*  But on the on the men's tour, you know, the guys are so far in the closet. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1884.62s)]
*  I don't even know who they are. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1888.5s)]
*  It's disappointing because the women are much more brave on that front. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1890.26s)]
*  I don't know why, actually. I don't know why. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1893.62s)]
*  You were born in Czechoslovakia. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1895.7s)]
*  What's now the Czech Republic? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1897.3s)]
*  Do you follow Czech politics still at all? Yes, unfortunately. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1898.8999999999999s)]
*  Why do you think something seems to have gone wrong? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1902.78s)]
*  Do you think it's something about the communist heritage [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1904.8999999999999s)]
*  of what is now Czech Republic that prevents it from being this perfect fit [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1907.26s)]
*  into the European Union? Or what's your diagnosis? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1910.82s)]
*  I mean, it's a great country to live in, but the politics have gone slightly downhill. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1912.82s)]
*  And I think people have a short memory and they're and they're kind of [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1918.1399999999999s)]
*  too many people still pining for the good old communist days [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1921.3400000000001s)]
*  as if there was anything good about it. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1924.38s)]
*  And a former communist, Zeman, was reelected president again [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1926.54s)]
*  or prime minister, whatever he is now. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1929.74s)]
*  And it's frustrating. But, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1931.5s)]
*  you know, it's still a great place to be in a democratic country. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1935.42s)]
*  And I think overall it's done really well. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1940.22s)]
*  But it's frustrating to me to see the right wing politics [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  winning so much of these days and the dictators [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1947.58s)]
*  or not dictators, but authoritarians winning the elections. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1951.62s)]
*  And how did you think about the split with Slovakia when that came? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1955.1799999999998s)]
*  I thought I think they would rather take it back if they could. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1958.3799999999999s)]
*  But it was peaceful. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1961.3s)]
*  It was done nicely. Nobody died. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1963.1s)]
*  Nobody there was no violence at all. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1965.26s)]
*  It was just people voted for it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1967.46s)]
*  And that was that. And, you know, it's it's a shame. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1968.86s)]
*  But that's what happened. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1972.06s)]
*  And say Czech writers, Ron Kondera or Hasek, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1973.22s)]
*  do you still read them, identify with them, follow them? [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1976.42s)]
*  Or are you just fully in an American life, but with the Czech background? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1979.34s)]
*  I'm both. I feel very much at home here. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1983.22s)]
*  I'm a total American, but I still feel at home when I go to Czech Republic. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1986.02s)]
*  My sister lives there. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1990.26s)]
*  You know, it's where I grew up. The town is the same. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1991.7s)]
*  There's still no traffic lights there. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1993.7s)]
*  You know, it hasn't changed. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1995.3799999999999s)]
*  And so I feel very, very much at home at both places. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=1997.18s)]
*  I must say, if Czechs play Americans in hockey, I root for the Czechs. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2000.5s)]
*  I shame to say that, but maybe it's still also kind of rooting for the underdog, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2006.7s)]
*  the smaller country, you know, I mean, we're a country of, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2010.9s)]
*  I think, like 10, 12 million people. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2013.06s)]
*  There's Yvonne Lindell, Martina Hengis, his mother yourself, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2015.18s)]
*  all from Czech Republic. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2018.82s)]
*  Why so much tennis talent from your country? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2020.3799999999999s)]
*  That was about the only sport we could play there. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2022.42s)]
*  No, I mean, for me, it was the possibility, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2024.78s)]
*  the availability of playing because we had a club in my hometown [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2027.3s)]
*  and the opportunity and I had good coaching. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2030.86s)]
*  And it was a sport that I loved. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2034.26s)]
*  Tennis, tennis, Yvonne Lindell was from a tennis family, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2036.18s)]
*  Martina, tennis family. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2040.46s)]
*  It was kind of passed generation to generation. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2042.6200000000001s)]
*  And also the club scene is very healthy. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2045.54s)]
*  Czechs are pretty athletic anyway and active. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2049.02s)]
*  But most of all, the clubs are set up where you you you walk to the club [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2051.9s)]
*  in your hometown, you know, it's very safe. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2056.66s)]
*  So you walk and you can stay there all day on the weekend or [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2059.14s)]
*  or after school, you go straight to tennis and play. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2063.26s)]
*  And then you come home before dark. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2065.62s)]
*  And, you know, it's just a nice scene. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2066.94s)]
*  It's cheap. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2069.38s)]
*  So you don't have to be wealthy to to make it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2070.98s)]
*  You have good coaching and and people to play with. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2074.2599999999998s)]
*  So, you know, I played against all the people, whatever my level was. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2077.2999999999997s)]
*  I played I played against those people. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2081.8599999999997s)]
*  It wasn't I only played against girls my age. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2083.5s)]
*  I played whoever I could compete against. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2086.02s)]
*  And that that breeds, I think, good players. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2088.46s)]
*  In your memoir, you wrote the following, and I quote, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2090.66s)]
*  Charlottesville reminded me of my part of Czechoslovakia, unquote. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2093.54s)]
*  Please explain. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2098.2599999999998s)]
*  You mean you mean last summer, Charlottesville? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2100.7799999999997s)]
*  No, no. Living in Charlottesville. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2104.62s)]
*  Well, it's the Blue Ridge Mountains. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2106.8199999999997s)]
*  It's the same same same climate and same countryside. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2108.7799999999997s)]
*  Very similar to where I grew up and comfortable. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2112.66s)]
*  Emotionally, what was it like to regain your Czech citizenship? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2117.18s)]
*  I waited for that. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2121.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2122.86s)]
*  You had to get so much paperwork done. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2124.1000000000004s)]
*  And I finally get it organized and I send it and I don't get anything back. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2125.78s)]
*  And I finally called. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2129.26s)]
*  They didn't get the paperwork. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2130.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I have to start over again. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2131.6200000000003s)]
*  So it's like two years later. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2132.98s)]
*  I finally got to it. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2134.02s)]
*  And it happened that I got it after Obama became president, not under George W. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2135.78s)]
*  Bush. And people were saying I did it on purpose because I didn't want to be [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2141.34s)]
*  an American anymore because of George W. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2145.34s)]
*  Bush had nothing to do with it. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2147.54s)]
*  I just wasn't organized enough to get all the paperwork done. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2148.5800000000004s)]
*  So so I have two passports here and I know it's it's nice to feel like you belong [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2152.98s)]
*  to both countries because when I defected, the reason I defected, it was you [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2158.7000000000003s)]
*  couldn't get visa unless the government allowed you to get visa. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2162.02s)]
*  So they wouldn't let me play the US Open. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2165.86s)]
*  So I defected. And then for six years, I was stateless. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2168.38s)]
*  I had I had a thing that said reentry permit looked like a passport, but it says [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2172.3s)]
*  reentry permit. And I had to get visa every single every single place I went. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2175.7400000000002s)]
*  And when you're filling out the paperwork, it says country of citizenship. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2180.46s)]
*  I had to put stateless. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2184.14s)]
*  Finally, in 81, when I got my citizenship, USA and the next I got my passport, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2185.82s)]
*  the next day I'm flying to Europe and they said, do you have a passport? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2191.14s)]
*  I'm like, do I have a passport? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2193.5s)]
*  I still remember that moment. I was so proud. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2195.42s)]
*  And now I have two passports. So it's very cool. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2197.98s)]
*  What was your biggest shock when you came here as a defector? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2200.54s)]
*  Well, I came here in 73. Right. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2205.06s)]
*  And then I defected in 75. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2207.9s)]
*  So when I first came here in 73. Yes. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2209.5s)]
*  Well, I've seen American cars before in Germany, but still the size of American cars. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2211.82s)]
*  And they're still astonished when you see an old Cadillac or Dorado. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2217.5s)]
*  It's like, you know, four feet longer than a SUV. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2220.22s)]
*  That's huge. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2223.5s)]
*  But what astonished me the most, I think, was that there were oranges. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2225.34s)]
*  The first time I played was in Fort Lauderdale. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2230.3s)]
*  And there was oranges on the trees. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2232.82s)]
*  You could just pick them off the tree. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2234.58s)]
*  And growing up, we had oranges like once a year. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2235.9s)]
*  For maybe two weeks for Christmas, you had oranges. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2239.5s)]
*  So it was like the most precious thing you could you could eat. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2242.5s)]
*  It was more expensive than beef. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2245.1s)]
*  And you could just pick it off the of the tree. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2246.98s)]
*  And I picked up a coconut. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2249.7s)]
*  It took me about three hours to get inside it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2250.74s)]
*  But I ate the inside of a coconut and and the size of ham on a sandwich. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2252.3s)]
*  Because growing up again, you know, pork was very expensive. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2257.66s)]
*  So you had bread and maybe one slice of ham. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2260.3s)]
*  So I would eat around it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2262.34s)]
*  So I got a big chunk of ham on the last bite. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2263.38s)]
*  And here you get a ham sandwich. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2265.78s)]
*  And it's like two pieces of bread. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2267.14s)]
*  And this much ham was like, oh, my God, this is amazing. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2268.5s)]
*  Two dollars, 50 cents for a ham sandwich. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2271.7s)]
*  Still remember it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2274.18s)]
*  For me, that was astonishing. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2275.5s)]
*  Grocery stores astonishing. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2276.62s)]
*  What bugged you the most the early years bothered me the most? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2278.5s)]
*  Yeah, probably not being able to talk to my family. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2281.42s)]
*  But about this country, obviously, you miss Transfamily, but about. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2285.74s)]
*  The American then nothing. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2289.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, things were great. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2292.2599999999998s)]
*  And see, well, I was Watergate, which I'm like, where is this place? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2293.54s)]
*  Watergate is the big thing. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2297.22s)]
*  Seventy three. I did not understand that. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2299.1s)]
*  But politics seem to be very reasonable. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2302.02s)]
*  People are, you know, nice and welcoming. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2304.22s)]
*  When I defected, I was welcome with open arms in Texas. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2306.7s)]
*  And I had everything. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2309.74s)]
*  So back then, nothing. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2313.3399999999997s)]
*  What was it like to go skiing with Donald Trump? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2315.66s)]
*  Well, his wife was a lot faster skier than he was. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2320.1s)]
*  I knew Ivana before she before she even met Donald Trump, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2323.86s)]
*  because she's Czech and she was a friend of a good Czech Czech friend of mine. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2328.46s)]
*  So I met her in New York back in the 70s and [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2331.98s)]
*  they all skied with him a couple of times in in in Aspen. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2334.5s)]
*  And, yeah, with the family. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2337.42s)]
*  Play tennis with him ever? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2340.42s)]
*  No, no, no. Have you seen? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2341.58s)]
*  That is a classic photo of him hitting a forehand volley. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2346.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, it's a thing of beauty. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2350.18s)]
*  Now, in some way, you wear those shorts. OK. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2356.22s)]
*  In some ways, you've been critical of the Trump presidency. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2361.8199999999997s)]
*  Some ways, some ways. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2364.38s)]
*  If you think about structurally, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2367.18s)]
*  how did America get into its current problems? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2369.22s)]
*  What's your explanation? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2374.66s)]
*  Facebook. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2376.38s)]
*  Cambridge Analytica. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2378.42s)]
*  Bots. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2380.58s)]
*  I mean, it was a perfect storm or a horrible storm for for Clinton. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2381.94s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2386.9s)]
*  Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2387.86s)]
*  Still, you thought somehow, you know, but again, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2389.5s)]
*  we knew about the Electoral College. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2392.86s)]
*  Maybe I think I think that system needs to be looked at. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2394.86s)]
*  It's not working. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2398.26s)]
*  If I lived in Hawaii, I would be really pissed because my vote doesn't count, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2399.94s)]
*  because by then the elections decided it should really be one person, one vote, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2402.62s)]
*  regardless of where you live. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2406.58s)]
*  I don't know why geography makes a difference. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2407.58s)]
*  I'm for state rights up to a point, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2410.2999999999997s)]
*  because if you do something here, you're OK. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2413.14s)]
*  And if you do the same thing here, you're a criminal. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2415.66s)]
*  I just don't get that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2417.7799999999997s)]
*  How can it be so disparate, so different from state to state, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2420.06s)]
*  particularly now with the legal marijuana, et cetera, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2422.9s)]
*  or crossing state lines with liquor in your car? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2425.66s)]
*  It's like it just doesn't make sense. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2428.22s)]
*  I'm not an authoritarian at all, obviously, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2430.1s)]
*  but I think the federal government needs to be more responsible [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2432.34s)]
*  for what's going on in our country. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2436.14s)]
*  There's too many things that are unfair in this country. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2438.8199999999997s)]
*  It could be so much better. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2441.1s)]
*  But how did it all happen? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2442.54s)]
*  I think you see the statistics and [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2444.2599999999998s)]
*  you get frustrated because it doesn't make any sense for so many women [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2447.74s)]
*  still to be voting that way. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2451.1s)]
*  People just don't pay enough attention to facts. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2452.9s)]
*  If I talk to a lot of Eastern European or communist demigrades, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2455.7s)]
*  Gary Kasparov, Masha Gessen, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2459.3799999999997s)]
*  I get the sense that they view what's happening in America now [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2461.8599999999997s)]
*  through the lens of their history and a history of fascism and authoritarianism. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2464.9s)]
*  I was born in the United States. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2469.98s)]
*  When I look at what's happening now, I tend to view it more [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2471.54s)]
*  as recreating a version of late 19th century politics, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2474.46s)]
*  where things are very partisan and wild and leaders make different kinds [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2477.62s)]
*  of irresponsible decisions or have strange rhetoric by, say, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2481.14s)]
*  the standards of the 80s or the 90s. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2484.38s)]
*  How convinced are you that kind of Eastern European authoritarian lens [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2487.1800000000003s)]
*  is the right way to think about what's happening in America? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2491.38s)]
*  Because that's how Trump got elected. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2494.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it is very, very similar to that. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2496.86s)]
*  I still get I don't understand this fear. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2500.46s)]
*  You know, we're supposed to be land of the free. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2503.38s)]
*  Yes, brave. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2505.6600000000003s)]
*  But fear is what drives people to make these decisions. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2507.58s)]
*  And I had therapy a long time ago, and the therapist said, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2510.82s)]
*  you don't ever make decisions based on fear because you make wrong decisions. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2514.02s)]
*  But that's what people are. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2517.6600000000003s)]
*  That's how people are voting based on fear so much. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2518.82s)]
*  And I don't know what we're afraid of, because nothing bad has really happened [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2521.62s)]
*  in this country since the Civil War. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2524.7799999999997s)]
*  You really think about it. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2527.54s)]
*  Pearl Harbor. Yes, horrible, awful. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2528.5s)]
*  But compare that to what went on in China, communist countries, whatever. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2530.7799999999997s)]
*  Of course, all the wars in Europe, the World War One, World War Two, Korean War. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2537.06s)]
*  Compare that to that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2540.98s)]
*  And there is no comparison. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2542.06s)]
*  We have not really been touched yet. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2543.62s)]
*  We're so scared here. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2545.2599999999998s)]
*  And of what? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2546.98s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2548.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like this manufactured fear. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2550.3s)]
*  And then people are just blind and they don't. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2552.7000000000003s)]
*  They make these decisions on emotions rather than rational thinking. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2557.02s)]
*  What's your ideal trip to Africa? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2563.54s)]
*  Describe that for us and why it appeals to you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2565.34s)]
*  Well, I spent a lot of time in Kenya and also been in Tanzania, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2568.46s)]
*  going to go a crater and have traveled all around Kenya. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2572.7400000000002s)]
*  So, yeah, just anywhere. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2577.34s)]
*  Just drive. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2578.86s)]
*  Just take a car and drive. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2580.1000000000004s)]
*  And that's actually why I learned to fly, because it's maybe not driving. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2581.86s)]
*  It's safer to fly in Kenya than to drive. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2584.5s)]
*  The roads are pretty bad, but it's magic. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2586.78s)]
*  Anybody that wants to go to Africa, do it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2590.2200000000003s)]
*  Don't think about it. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2592.7400000000002s)]
*  It's amazing. The people are fantastic and the animals. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2594.46s)]
*  It's just magic. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2598.1800000000003s)]
*  Two final questions. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2599.38s)]
*  First, going back in time. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2600.54s)]
*  Yeah. What can you share with us about what you're planning on doing next [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2601.6600000000003s)]
*  with your energy, your organizational managerial and educational abilities? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2605.62s)]
*  Plus your athleticism. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2610.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, maybe get a GED. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2612.14s)]
*  I mean, helping my kids with their homework, I think I could pass, but I don't know. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2618.02s)]
*  Seriously, I do a lot of speaking. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2623.38s)]
*  I do speeches around the world on women's issues, LGBT. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2625.14s)]
*  Still being an activist. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2629.7s)]
*  I'm going to march in on Saturday in Miami. Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2631.02s)]
*  I can't I can't come to Washington, but I'll be marching in Miami. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2634.14s)]
*  Actually, we live about 10 minutes from Parkland, so it really hit home [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2639.46s)]
*  as my daughter was her friends were wondering whether, you know, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2643.14s)]
*  their friends were impacted. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2646.94s)]
*  Of course, everybody was impacted, but if people got hurt. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2650.26s)]
*  So, yeah, I think just keep being an activist, keep speaking out for [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2653.86s)]
*  for the right things. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2659.26s)]
*  I always been a proponent of for the little guy, you know, always [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2660.94s)]
*  was defending the the the little kid against the bullies. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2665.5s)]
*  And so I'll keep doing that because that's that's just who I am. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2669.34s)]
*  Can't help it. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2672.46s)]
*  And final question to the before we get to audience Q&A, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2673.3s)]
*  to the extent you are still optimistic about the United States. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2676.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2679.58s)]
*  What is it that most makes you optimistic? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2680.34s)]
*  Our institutions, but I think the people are waking up. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2683.38s)]
*  I think we kind of slid into [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2686.42s)]
*  complacency and being comfortable, almost lazy. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2689.7000000000003s)]
*  Nothing bad is going to happen. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2693.26s)]
*  But little by little, you know, that that frog is going to get boiled [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2694.58s)]
*  in that water. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2698.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are starting to jump out of the water now. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2698.9s)]
*  So I think people are waking up and getting involved. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2701.5s)]
*  And most of all, the young ones. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2705.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think, again, maybe Parkland may be the the tipping point [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2707.02s)]
*  in a for a horrible reason, but in a good way now that the young kids [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2711.5s)]
*  are realizing that we don't want the old people to decide [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2715.62s)]
*  what our lives will look like 20 years from now or 30 years from now, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2718.38s)]
*  or what they look like now, actually. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2721.18s)]
*  So I think I'm optimistic because of the because of the young ones. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2723.2599999999998s)]
*  Martina, thank you very much. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2728.42s)]
*  Tyler, you need to drink more water. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2737.2599999999998s)]
*  You're not hiring at all. Yes. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2738.54s)]
*  That's the athlete in me. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2743.14s)]
*  We will take questions at two mics. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2745.5s)]
*  I will alternate. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2747.7s)]
*  Please note, these are questions we are here to hear from Martina. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2748.98s)]
*  If you start making a speech, I will cut you off. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2752.26s)]
*  And she, of course, has the option of not answering any questions [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2755.66s)]
*  she doesn't want to. OK, please. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2758.42s)]
*  I'll talk to the tennis team before I got here. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2762.3s)]
*  So there are other questions. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2764.7s)]
*  I'm Martina. Hello. Yes. Question. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2766.34s)]
*  Just want to say it's an honor to to meet you and listen to your speech. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2769.42s)]
*  You're awesome. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2772.82s)]
*  Thank you, George Mason, for having us. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2773.7400000000002s)]
*  Question going back to the big news today [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2775.9s)]
*  and recently about the pay gap and Wimbledon. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2778.54s)]
*  My thought and I guess my question to you is moving forward this year [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2781.94s)]
*  and from now on, will you not do any commentary either with BBC [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2785.58s)]
*  or here in the United States, unless it's guaranteed that the pay gap [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2790.66s)]
*  between you and someone like John McEnroe will be completely decreased? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2794.02s)]
*  Well, it's again, it's not about me and John McEnroe. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2798.18s)]
*  It's about what women should be getting paid compared to men. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2800.5s)]
*  I think transparency is the is the biggest reason why we don't have equal [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2804.78s)]
*  pay or closer to it, certainly because people don't know [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2808.78s)]
*  what anybody else is making. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2813.1000000000004s)]
*  I said I would work for BBC for free. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2814.78s)]
*  That's the only game in town. I really wanted to work. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2816.54s)]
*  I wanted to speak to people in England. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2819.34s)]
*  Wimbledon is has been always broadcast by BBC ever since there was TV. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2822.94s)]
*  It's always been BBC. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2827.78s)]
*  So it's the only game in town. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2828.78s)]
*  And when they tell you this is all there is, so you take it. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2830.34s)]
*  I would probably work for rather for free than get paid one tenth, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2833.54s)]
*  quite frankly, because I really want to. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2837.6200000000003s)]
*  It's not about the money. It's about what's fair. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2840.1000000000004s)]
*  And I don't have the problem with tennis channel. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2842.34s)]
*  I get, you know, I don't have a problem there. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2844.3s)]
*  I think they're very fair. Same with BT Sport. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2847.94s)]
*  I also do some work with them. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2850.38s)]
*  I haven't quite frankly known that it was this disparate. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2852.1000000000004s)]
*  And I think it's across the board for the other athletes, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2856.26s)]
*  whether it's Lindsay Davenport compared to what Andy Roddick's making [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2859.5s)]
*  or Tracy Austin compared to Tim Henman or whatever. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2862.3s)]
*  However, you want to put it, the pay gap is huge [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2865.46s)]
*  and it's a lot bigger than we even thought. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2868.94s)]
*  And it needs to it needs to stop. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2871.34s)]
*  And maybe tennis will be another push forward in the right direction. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2873.7000000000003s)]
*  So it's not about how much we're getting paid, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2879.54s)]
*  but it's about getting paid fairly compared to other people. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2882.34s)]
*  Yeah. Next question over here. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2887.5s)]
*  Hi, Martina. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2890.62s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2892.42s)]
*  It's been a pleasure to hear your comments. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2893.58s)]
*  I have a very practical question and it deals with nutrition [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2895.86s)]
*  and your feelings about nutrition. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2900.18s)]
*  And would you be able to reveal your diet? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2902.02s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because I've I've I don't even want to start. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2905.7s)]
*  Yes, I'll tell you. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2909.86s)]
*  Just the last six weeks, I started this diet called Whole 30. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2910.9s)]
*  Because I was too used to having a drink every night [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2914.82s)]
*  or to this time, I got a little bit bigger and I could. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2919.5s)]
*  And I've been eating less, but I still couldn't shake it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2923.5800000000004s)]
*  And I'm fit. I'm in good shape and everything. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2926.1000000000004s)]
*  But I was just ticked off that, you know, but but most of all, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2928.6200000000003s)]
*  I didn't want to get into a habit of drinking. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2932.6200000000003s)]
*  And but I always I've been eating healthy since 81 [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2935.6600000000003s)]
*  when I really got into nutrition, but I still couldn't shake it. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2938.54s)]
*  But I still couldn't shake it. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2941.94s)]
*  And so this Whole 30 is no no dairy, no alcohol and no grains, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2943.1s)]
*  which means no sugar. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2947.66s)]
*  That's no sugar grains, grains is sugar. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2949.86s)]
*  And I mostly did it just to see what I feel like. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2952.42s)]
*  And I've had much better energy. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2955.66s)]
*  I've also got a coffee, which I didn't need to. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2957.54s)]
*  And yeah, so I've been much, much happier camper. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2960.02s)]
*  And the weight came off without even looking at the scale. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2962.98s)]
*  It just my pants. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2965.82s)]
*  I was like, oh, they're falling off. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2966.86s)]
*  So I feel much, much better. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2969.5s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2971.46s)]
*  Well, mostly proteins and nuts, lots of nuts, avocados and eggs and [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2972.6200000000003s)]
*  lots of veggies. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2979.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Next question. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2980.98s)]
*  No grains. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2982.06s)]
*  Grain is sugar. Yeah. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2982.98s)]
*  Just realize how much pasta is just a filler. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2984.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not very. Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2986.9s)]
*  Anyway, I have two totally disconnected questions. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2988.3s)]
*  OK, quick, quick ones. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2991.7400000000002s)]
*  So I was just wondering what your opinion was of the Billie Jean King [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2992.98s)]
*  movie with Bobby Riggs. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=2998.38s)]
*  And my other question is, what was your favorite place to eat in Charlottesville? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3000.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I don't remember a Charlottesville question [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3004.7400000000002s)]
*  because that was 30, almost 40 years ago. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3011.62s)]
*  So, yeah, that's a while back. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3014.94s)]
*  But the Bobby Riggs, the movie, I was not in the country [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3016.7000000000003s)]
*  because it was in 73. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3021.6600000000003s)]
*  I had just had to leave to go back to Czechoslovakia because of my visa. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3022.94s)]
*  Visa ran out. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3026.1s)]
*  So I did not go to Houston, just read about it in the paper. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3027.2999999999997s)]
*  And I never watched the film. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3029.98s)]
*  I mean, the actual match. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3032.18s)]
*  And I didn't. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3034.9s)]
*  I was invited to these premieres during during the [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3036.58s)]
*  when they were starting them at Wimbledon at the US Open last year. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3040.62s)]
*  But I just couldn't make it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3044.18s)]
*  I was working whatever. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3045.3399999999997s)]
*  And ironically, I finally said, OK, I'm going to watch it on the plane [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3046.7799999999997s)]
*  back from Melbourne, because that's when I catch on all my movies, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3049.8199999999997s)]
*  catch up on the long flights. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3052.2599999999998s)]
*  And guess who's on the flight? Billie Jean. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3053.94s)]
*  She was sitting over there with her with her girlfriend. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3057.1s)]
*  And behind me, behind me is Venus Williams. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3059.62s)]
*  And then John McEnroe was there as well. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3062.18s)]
*  But I think he flew first. We were in business. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3064.5s)]
*  I'm kidding. I don't know. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3067.5s)]
*  I don't know, actually. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3070.22s)]
*  But I didn't realize John was on the plane as well. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3072.22s)]
*  And anyway, so I watched the movie. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3074.8199999999997s)]
*  They took some liberties, but it was it was it was well done. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3076.46s)]
*  Very well done. I thought Emma and Steve Carle were fantastic. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3078.9s)]
*  What's the best tennis movie if I may interject? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3082.94s)]
*  Your favorite? Well, that was good. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3085.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think this one probably would have been the best. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3087.1000000000004s)]
*  And also it had very much a social social message. So, yeah. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3090.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think the tennis was the best in this one from the tennis movies that I've seen. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3095.46s)]
*  Next question. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3100.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm curious what [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3103.5800000000004s)]
*  what trends you've seen in in tennis double strategy over the last [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3105.34s)]
*  10 years, what you see coming up, for example, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3110.5s)]
*  it seems like players are clogging the middle a lot more now and kind of leaving open [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3113.9s)]
*  the shot up the line. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3120.14s)]
*  Well, the biggest thing in doubles is cover the middle. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3121.74s)]
*  So, you know, people cover the line too much [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3124.98s)]
*  and you may get passed once or twice down the line, but you will get 15 balls. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3128.34s)]
*  Go through the middle. You can always blame it on your partner. Right. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3132.42s)]
*  So was your shot. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3135.5s)]
*  But if it's down your line, everybody's embarrassed because it's my line. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3136.5s)]
*  So people guard the line with their life and they leave the middle [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3139.46s)]
*  to open in regular doubles, professional doubles. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3142.42s)]
*  They're better at covering the middle. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3145.58s)]
*  But it's more or less serving volley. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3147.26s)]
*  People are serving and staying back again, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3149.2200000000003s)]
*  because the rackets make it so much easier to hit those ground strokes. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3151.9s)]
*  So you see longer valleys, some fun doubles. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3154.46s)]
*  But I'll go for the old style serving volley. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3157.58s)]
*  But, yeah, serve all is still works if you do it well enough. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3160.42s)]
*  Next question. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3165.54s)]
*  I guess one justification for a different pay scale for men and women [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3167.58s)]
*  in the tournaments in the tournaments is the difference in games [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3172.1s)]
*  they play for finals, three games for women, five for the men. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3176.46s)]
*  Could you comment on that? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3181.06s)]
*  Three out of five sets. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3182.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes, they do that in every round. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3183.7799999999997s)]
*  They've been doing that forever at Wimbledon. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3185.66s)]
*  And then the other slams caught up. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3188.1s)]
*  Then some some men's tournaments were three out of five finals. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3189.94s)]
*  But the rest of it was two out of three. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3193.42s)]
*  Then they realized it just takes too much out of them. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3194.74s)]
*  So all the tournaments now are two out of three, except in the Grand Slams. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3197.42s)]
*  And that's three out of five women. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3201.26s)]
*  They were holding that against us, actually, when we asked for equal prize money. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3204.0200000000004s)]
*  I said, oh, but you only play two out of three and men play three out of five. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3206.78s)]
*  And he said, well, we'll play three out of five. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3210.0600000000004s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, we don't want you to do that. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3211.6600000000003s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3214.7400000000002s)]
*  So we offered I think the men should play two out of three. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3216.5400000000004s)]
*  But that's that's just me. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3218.94s)]
*  That's another story. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3220.5400000000004s)]
*  And also they found that until they slowed down the grass at Wimbledon, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3221.9s)]
*  which was again the last tournament that finally gave us equal prize money, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3226.94s)]
*  the ball was in play longer in the women's matches in two out of three set [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3230.7000000000003s)]
*  matches than the men's matches three out of five. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3234.5s)]
*  So but, you know, you don't get paid for quantity. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3237.0600000000004s)]
*  You get paid for quality. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3240.2200000000003s)]
*  And I think a lot of people when they did actually they did studies. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3241.42s)]
*  Most people came to Wimbledon. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3245.9s)]
*  They've they've done questionnaires and most people came to Wimbledon to watch men. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3247.3s)]
*  But then when they were leaving, they actually enjoyed watching the women more than the men. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3251.9s)]
*  So it depends on who you watch that day, whatever. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3256.1000000000004s)]
*  But the whole point is that we contribute equally to the success of the tournament. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3259.9s)]
*  We're willing to play three out of five, but they didn't want us to do that. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3265.3s)]
*  It's silly. I think, again, the men should play two out of three. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3268.1s)]
*  And because both men and women in play, they should be paid the same. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3271.02s)]
*  End of story. It's the right thing to do, by the way. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3275.14s)]
*  And they were using that with the with the with the Mackinac [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3281.7400000000002s)]
*  also that he does longer matches, but he does women's matches. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3284.1s)]
*  I wanted to do the women's final, but he's doing the women's final. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3286.94s)]
*  And you don't you don't get paid because you talk you talk longer or whatever. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3289.9s)]
*  And I'm willing to do men's matches, but they don't let me. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3296.46s)]
*  So there's that tennis channel. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3300.02s)]
*  I've done a bunch of men's matches, and it's a lot of fun. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3302.06s)]
*  Next question. This is another tennis question. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3305.06s)]
*  I noticed a lot of the analyst will attribute a lot of thinking in the court [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3307.82s)]
*  when there's a shot that is a successful winner. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3313.5s)]
*  Like he said, he said, well, instead of going down the line, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3317.1s)]
*  he obviously went across court and thought very carefully about that shot [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3320.18s)]
*  when often it seems to me they're just hitting the damn ball, as you say. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3325.7400000000002s)]
*  So when you're out there playing, how much of it is the thought process [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3329.98s)]
*  as opposed to just hitting the damn ball? [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3334.22s)]
*  Well, it's both. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3336.06s)]
*  But you have to you have to think very quickly [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3337.3s)]
*  because it happens in a split second, doesn't it? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3340.18s)]
*  And I always said it's better to hit the wrong shot well [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3342.26s)]
*  than hit the right shot badly, because if you overthink it, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3345.9s)]
*  at the end, you may hit the right shot. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3349.06s)]
*  But by then you're like, maybe I should have it over there. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3350.34s)]
*  So just go with your instinct and you play percentages. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3353.3s)]
*  I mean, you see if it, you know, you have a strategy, if it works, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3356.62s)]
*  you don't change it. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3360.3s)]
*  And if you're losing, then you change it. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3361.3s)]
*  So maybe you go down the line, down the line, down the line. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3363.38s)]
*  Finally, they cover it. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3365.94s)]
*  So now you go cross court next time they cover it. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3366.7400000000002s)]
*  So it's always cat and mouse with your opponent. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3368.7400000000002s)]
*  So that's the fun part. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3371.3s)]
*  But sometimes they again, it's it's easy to overanalyze. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3372.78s)]
*  So, like I said, better to hit the wrong shot well [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3376.5s)]
*  than hit the right shot badly. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3379.7400000000002s)]
*  So next question. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3381.94s)]
*  And I think sometimes they're just talking out of their ear. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3384.3s)]
*  Hi, thank you for being here today. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3388.9s)]
*  I watched you when I was a kid and a teenager watching you play [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3390.86s)]
*  was just a huge thrill. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3393.9s)]
*  So thank you. I appreciate it. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3394.98s)]
*  I was going to ask a tennis question, but I'll switch it. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3397.82s)]
*  Gay rights, there's been obviously enormous progress [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3400.38s)]
*  and sometimes pulling backwards. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3403.7799999999997s)]
*  And I wanted to hear what you thought about, you know, in these times, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3405.38s)]
*  what you think are the real are the battlegrounds that people should be fighting now. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3410.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, states rights. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3415.1s)]
*  There have been Michelangelo Senorilla, who is a gay activist [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3416.82s)]
*  and a TV and radio personality, actually wrote a book about it. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3419.7799999999997s)]
*  He thought once we got the right to marry, everybody was celebrating. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3423.18s)]
*  He says, just watch. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3427.1s)]
*  There's going to be so much backlash and so many state laws are going to come up [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3428.3s)]
*  where they will try to roll back what we had just won. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3431.98s)]
*  And that's exactly what's been happening. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3434.98s)]
*  So you just be alert and pay attention to what's going on in your state, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3436.86s)]
*  in your in your county, in your district, whatever. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3440.46s)]
*  And and fight those fight those battles, you know, one by one. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3443.3s)]
*  It's a shame that we still have to do that. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3446.82s)]
*  That's where, again, I wish the federal government would step up [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3448.3s)]
*  and and just make it against the law to make these regulations. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3450.78s)]
*  But they're going the wrong way. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3454.38s)]
*  They're going the other way on that. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3456.5s)]
*  And certainly Trump has not not been helpful in that regard at all. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3457.58s)]
*  So that's an understatement. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3462.02s)]
*  So he held that rainbow flag during one of the rallies, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3464.14s)]
*  but he didn't know was upside down. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3467.66s)]
*  And he says, I'll be your biggest friend to the LGBT community. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3470.9s)]
*  Yeah, if friends like that [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3474.66s)]
*  you run the other way, so you just pay attention and be [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3477.86s)]
*  and get involved on a local level. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3480.34s)]
*  Grassroots changes, change comes from the grassroots [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3482.2999999999997s)]
*  and it comes from the top down. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3485.46s)]
*  It's much quicker for it to happen from the top down. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3486.74s)]
*  But these days we have to do it from the bottom up. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3489.3799999999997s)]
*  So just stay vigilant and stay involved. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3491.66s)]
*  Next question and vote. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3494.8599999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3497.4599999999996s)]
*  Vote. My question is about basketball. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3498.3399999999997s)]
*  And I met you and Nancy Lieberman at Old Dominion University [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3502.7799999999997s)]
*  and in the clubhouse level at a basketball game one time. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3507.2599999999998s)]
*  So it was it was a thrill to meet you all then. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3511.5s)]
*  But did you play basketball in Czechoslovakia? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3516.14s)]
*  And when you came to the United States and I'm thinking. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3520.62s)]
*  I did not. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3525.5s)]
*  OK, you did not. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3526.2999999999997s)]
*  And so did you start when you met Nancy? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3527.22s)]
*  Nancy taught me how to do a layup. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3530.86s)]
*  Yes, I started from scratch. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3532.7s)]
*  And what did you like about it? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3535.2599999999998s)]
*  What was it? What did it do for you and for tennis? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3537.18s)]
*  Well, fitness, obviously, it's a very similar movement. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3540.54s)]
*  And just being on a team rather than by yourself. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3543.7s)]
*  And it was a completely different sport. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3547.7799999999997s)]
*  I also sprained my ankle a few times playing basketball. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3549.54s)]
*  But the pluses were outweighing the possibility of minuses of getting hurt [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3552.18s)]
*  and just love the competition and, you know, two and two or three on three. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3555.8599999999997s)]
*  Full court. That was my favorite. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3560.62s)]
*  You just run and play and shoot and go the other way. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3562.2599999999998s)]
*  Then the combination of of finesse. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3566.22s)]
*  And also, I'm kind of a bit of a mutt in that I should better. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3569.58s)]
*  I should lefty, but I do better layup right handed because it's like a toss on the serve. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3573.7799999999997s)]
*  And I dribble better with my right hand, but and I move better to my right. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3578.98s)]
*  But I should left. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3582.2599999999998s)]
*  So I was I was confusing for people. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3583.4599999999996s)]
*  And because I was in good shape, I ran a lot. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3586.4199999999996s)]
*  So they wanted me on my team because two on two or three and three [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3588.4599999999996s)]
*  really pays off to be in good shape. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3591.14s)]
*  But anyway, I love the sport. I think it's a great game. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3592.54s)]
*  Next question. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3595.74s)]
*  OK, I have a quick question. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3596.8599999999997s)]
*  I also watched you as a kid and it's been great to listen to you today. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3598.66s)]
*  And just one little side thing, I am a high school coach around here for tennis. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3601.8599999999997s)]
*  And I am thinking after hearing your your fitness regimen, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3606.8599999999997s)]
*  that I've been a little too light on my kids. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3610.74s)]
*  And so my question is really quick and it's personal. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3613.5s)]
*  So you may not want to answer it, but you're your kids. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3616.58s)]
*  Do they play tennis? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3619.66s)]
*  They don't love it. They play, but they don't love it, which is fine with me. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3621.5s)]
*  You know, my wife wanted him to be tennis players and I [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3624.22s)]
*  had somebody else work with them. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3627.0200000000004s)]
*  I worked with them sometimes, but they don't love it. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3628.6200000000003s)]
*  And that's OK. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3630.7000000000003s)]
*  The older one likes to sing. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3631.94s)]
*  The younger one likes to dance. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3633.0600000000004s)]
*  So that's OK. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3634.5s)]
*  The younger ones walking around in ballet slippers with the on her tiptoes. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3635.5s)]
*  And she can't wait for her ballet practice. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3639.6200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, that's when you know she when she asked me to play tennis [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3642.5s)]
*  twice a year, I play with her. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3645.9s)]
*  But I don't push it. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3648.46s)]
*  So, yeah, but yeah, physical fitness, if you don't get to the ball, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3649.42s)]
*  you can't hit it so well. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3653.1000000000004s)]
*  And when you get tired, then you start making bad decisions. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3654.62s)]
*  And that goes for real life, too, which is why it's always important [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3656.9s)]
*  to take good care of yourself. Period. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3659.7s)]
*  Next question. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3662.46s)]
*  Hi, I came out in 1976 and cried when you did. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3665.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3668.7799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3670.8199999999997s)]
*  Second factor is lifelong tennis fan. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3672.2999999999997s)]
*  There is so much beauty in your serve in volley game. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3676.1s)]
*  And I know that you're still playing some legends matches. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3678.7s)]
*  And there's such a dearth of high quality video of you playing [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3682.9s)]
*  that I wish that we could encourage someone to get out there and film you. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3687.14s)]
*  Even now. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3692.2599999999998s)]
*  No, it's better to go through the archives [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3693.22s)]
*  because I still serve in volley. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3697.46s)]
*  Just takes me a while longer to get to the net. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3698.86s)]
*  I saw a mosey on down. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3701.2599999999998s)]
*  I saw one film and and you know, there's so much of your game. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3704.3s)]
*  You still thank you. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3707.5s)]
*  All the hands are still there. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3708.3s)]
*  The eyes are still there. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3709.34s)]
*  But the legs. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3710.38s)]
*  But I don't practice it. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3712.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't practice fast, which the fast, which is gone [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3713.06s)]
*  because I just can't get myself fired up. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3715.3s)]
*  But thank you. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3717.26s)]
*  But yeah, it's a shame that they did not have so many so many matches [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3718.34s)]
*  where we're not captured nowadays. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3722.02s)]
*  You can watch the players play just about every match they play, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3725.1s)]
*  especially the top ones. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3728.38s)]
*  It's always somewhere. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3729.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, I come from the days where the VHS didn't even exist. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3731.06s)]
*  First time I saw myself actually hit a ball on in a video. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3735.54s)]
*  I think I was like 16 years old. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3739.38s)]
*  So I remember looking at photos of other players and flipping it [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3741.3s)]
*  so I could see what they look like left handed. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3745.7400000000002s)]
*  So I could compare myself or I would I would mirror myself in the mirror [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3748.62s)]
*  so I could see what I look like right handed and then compare it to the other players [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3752.1s)]
*  because you have an image and being a lefty, I didn't see that. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3755.7400000000002s)]
*  So, yeah, but yeah, there's some stuff on YouTube. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3759.34s)]
*  I think you can catch enough. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3763.02s)]
*  But the quality of the video is not that good. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3764.1800000000003s)]
*  And watching Wimbledon on TV on our black and white grainy, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3767.7s)]
*  you know, screen that was this big. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3772.42s)]
*  You only knew that the ball was there because the players moved that way. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3774.62s)]
*  You couldn't actually see the ball. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3779.06s)]
*  So now they have Hawkeye. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3782.14s)]
*  I'm like, God, I wish they had that in my day. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3783.66s)]
*  I would have won a few more matches and wouldn't have to color my hair [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3785.5s)]
*  because, you know, I lost. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3788.86s)]
*  I got a lot of gray hairs from those bad line calls. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3790.06s)]
*  Nowadays, there's no stress. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3793.46s)]
*  There's no stress about line calls. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3795.18s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3796.58s)]
*  Two more questions. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3797.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3799.14s)]
*  Martina, thank you so much for being here. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3800.14s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3802.42s)]
*  What's the best advice anyone ever gave you about processing a poor performance [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3802.9s)]
*  after a match? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3808.42s)]
*  Well, it's it's it goes back to what happened. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3810.34s)]
*  You know, just breaking down why I lost. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3814.1s)]
*  Was it just a bad day or did I not prepare properly? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3818.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, something broke down technically. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3821.62s)]
*  Was it tactics? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3824.2599999999998s)]
*  Did I get tired? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3825.54s)]
*  Did I not sleep well? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3826.5s)]
*  So there is no better. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3828.5s)]
*  There is no great advice. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3830.14s)]
*  It's just figuring out the problem and then and then figure a solution to it. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3831.22s)]
*  Always staying in the solution. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3836.18s)]
*  And this is what we're going to work on so that it doesn't happen again. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3837.86s)]
*  Just try to minimize those possibilities and and keep keep trying to get better. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3841.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3847.86s)]
*  Last question. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3848.22s)]
*  What is your opinion of PEDs performing and enhancing drugs? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3849.7s)]
*  As far as drug testing in tennis and other professional sports? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3854.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think they do a pretty good job in tennis. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3857.2200000000003s)]
*  They even take blood sometimes. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3860.6200000000003s)]
*  And then they don't just wait up after after the players out of the tournament. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3863.34s)]
*  So they they they test pretty rigorously and they do out of competition testing as well. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3868.3s)]
*  So you have to give them a schedule and it's it's pretty it's pretty intense. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3874.02s)]
*  And I think for tennis, there is certainly there are drugs that would be helpful, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3878.1800000000003s)]
*  but it's such a complex sport that, you know, a drug for, for example, bicycling, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3882.06s)]
*  it's all about endurance. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3889.02s)]
*  It's very specific for tennis. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3890.82s)]
*  It's it's much more than just that. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3892.9s)]
*  But there are certainly drugs that would be helpful and they're trying to do their best. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3895.54s)]
*  But usually there are people that are still ahead of the ahead of the game in that in that regard. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3898.66s)]
*  But we try to do the best that we can. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3905.1s)]
*  It can certainly be better. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3907.66s)]
*  But if people really want to cheat, I think they can still do that, unfortunately. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3909.3s)]
*  Martina, thank you very much. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2iXuSRWKpA&t=3913.7400000000002s)]
