# Jeffrey Sachs on Charter Cities and How to Reform Graduate Economics Education  Convos with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [April 09, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8pEgvzJ7p4)
*  Well, good afternoon.
*  Thank you all for joining us.
*  My name is Dan Rothschild.
*  I'm the Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at the Mercatus Center at George Mason
*  University.
*  Thank you all for joining us for what is sure to be an interesting event, the latest in
*  our conversations with Tyler series with our special guest today, Professor Jeffrey Sachs
*  from Columbia University.
*  The Mercatus Center is the world's premier university-based resource for market-oriented
*  ideas and our mission at the Mercatus Center is to bridge the gap between academic research
*  and real-world public policy questions in Washington, states and local governments and
*  indeed around the world.
*  And today's event is in aid of that.
*  The conversations with Tyler series is all about bringing together world-class thought
*  leaders who are thinking big thoughts about important ideas for conversations with the
*  general director of the Mercatus Center.
*  With that, it's my pleasure to introduce Tyler Cowen.
*  Tyler is the Holbert L. Harris Professor of Economics at George Mason University.
*  He also along with Alex Tabarrok is the co-blogger at MarginalRevolution.com, one of the country's
*  premier econ blogs and with Alex is the co-creator of Marginal Revolution University, an innovative
*  online platform for learning about and teaching economics.
*  For those of you who are readers of Marginal Revolution, as you already know, Tyler's
*  interests are many and varied, which makes him the perfect host for this series.
*  Now I don't know where he and Professor Sachs are going to go in their conversation today,
*  but I'm sure it's going to be challenging, it's going to be interesting and above all,
*  it's going to be smart.
*  So again, on behalf of the Mercatus Center, thank you all for joining us today and please
*  join me in welcoming Tyler Cowen and Jeffrey Sachs.
*  I introduce Jeff Sachs, that's easy.
*  Jeff is one of the world's best, most famous and most influential economists.
*  There's more I could say, but let's start with that.
*  The purpose of these series is to have conversations that you don't find other places on YouTube
*  and to ask probing questions and have a far ranging dialogue.
*  So what I'd like to do is a kind of overview of Jeff's career and thought and try to see
*  how it all hangs together, how the different pieces relate to each other.
*  So what I'd like to do is start with some of the early pieces from the 80s and 1990s
*  and then we'll work our way up to the present.
*  So the first question Jeff, and we'll treat this as a dialogue, but some of your best
*  cited work has been on the natural resource curse, the idea that economies, when they
*  have natural resources such as oil, that can harm their prospects for growth rather
*  than helping them.
*  Now we're in 2015, how do you see this issue today and do you think that has changed in
*  any way since the first pieces you wrote?
*  Well first let me say thank you for having me and I'm really looking forward to our
*  discussion.
*  About 25 years ago I started looking more and more at my own work at how economic structure,
*  geography, resource base and so forth affected development and I've been on a learning
*  curve since then.
*  One of the early works that I engaged in at that point with Andrew Warner and others was
*  looking at this question of how resource wealth and resource dependence one could say affected
*  development and we found back in the 1990s looking for the preceding 25 years or so that
*  the oil rich countries had grown less rapidly, controlling for seemingly other factors that
*  would be relevant and we started to speculate about that.
*  There's now a huge literature from many different points of view, politics, pure economics
*  and so forth and I would say that it's a pretty rich subject and not so simple to summarize
*  but there really is a resource curse for a lot of resource rich countries and I would
*  say at this point looking back that I would put more weight on the political economy aspects
*  probably than the pure market driven Dutch disease aspects which I talked about a quarter
*  century ago.
*  The idea at the time was that if you have resource wealth that pulls you away from more
*  labor intensive and technology intensive industries so you don't learn as much, you don't develop
*  as much endogenous growth.
*  Now I would say if you have resource wealth, well one problem is you're likely to be invaded.
*  You have more vulnerability to geopolitics as well as to internal politics to mess things
*  up.
*  Is this a habit you can kick or is it path dependence?
*  So the price of oil now is quite low and do you think well those countries that have a
*  lot of oil now they're going to be better off because they'll be put on this new development
*  path or is it somehow too late that they're stuck with the bad institutions?
*  Well first I think one of the things that I've tried to emphasize and that I've learned
*  over time is it's always pretty complicated so there are resource rich countries that
*  do very well thank you.
*  There are resource rich countries that have fallen apart a long time ago and never gotten
*  out of the mess so any generalization is fraught with the problems.
*  Norway will do well whether the oil price is high or low.
*  Whether on the other hand last time the oil, world oil price was persistently low, the
*  Soviet Union collapsed, Russia was in near hyperinflation.
*  So different countries under different conditions will adjust to these shocks.
*  Resource rich Norway, Australia, Canada, I wouldn't worry too much about them.
*  Their currencies will weaken.
*  They will find other things to do whereas some of the very vulnerable countries that
*  have never been able to kick the habit of dependence like Venezuela will probably go
*  into a deeper crisis and the Middle East has been in flames now for years and I don't
*  see any easy way out there either.
*  Here's a tension I'm trying to figure out and it relates to a number of issues in your
*  thought.
*  You've written some very interesting pieces lately about how the role of institutions
*  is overrated in predicting growth but institutions seem to play a key role in making the resource
*  theory stick because as you say Norway has done fine, the US in earlier times did fine
*  with a lot of natural resources.
*  So does thinking about resources lead you back to seeing institutions as important in
*  some new and different way or are you still basically skeptical about institutions mattering
*  at all and wanting to look most of all to geography?
*  Do you see what I'm getting at?
*  Of course but I think again I'll say it repeatedly.
*  I've never said institutions don't matter.
*  I've said institutions aren't the only thing.
*  I find often that people take an idea and carry it to an extreme and this institutions
*  matters idea is one of those that I found taken to extremes by causing a kind of geographic
*  blindness if I could say it.
*  Geography obviously matters a lot.
*  Resource base matters a lot.
*  Institutions matter a lot.
*  The world's complex, we're dealing with complex systems and so it's not surprising that different
*  things matter at different times and different places.
*  So of course institutions make a difference.
*  The art of good economics in my view is trying to figure out what's important where, when
*  and in which context.
*  Here's a claim you've made.
*  It's very striking.
*  I think it's one of the most important claims in development economics and personally I
*  think it's true.
*  When you reviewed Asimoglu and Robinson you said if we go to the year 1960 even knowing
*  who the winners and losers have been, much less forget about forecasting, it's very hard
*  to come up with a metric of institutions that predicts which countries end up doing well
*  and which countries end up doing poorly.
*  Now when I read that I tend to think somehow we're mismeasuring institutional quality and
*  we really need a better measure of institutions which we don't have yet and institutions
*  will someday matter again but I'm looking for this in vain and where does your thought
*  stand on this now?
*  Do you actually think there's some deeper understanding of institutions that will rescue
*  this proposition because when you throw out North Korea and some other crazy countries
*  institutions don't really have the predictive power for growth and what are your thoughts
*  on this given that in the cross-country regressions they can do so poorly within the set of semi-reasonable
*  countries?
*  Well, you know Asimoglu and Robinson's book Why Nations Fail was one of my least favorite
*  books.
*  I think it is just a bad book because it takes one thought and tries to drive it as
*  the only explanation of history and that's not a good approach in my view to history
*  which is a very interesting complex tableau and they missed one fundamental point right
*  from the start which is that when you look at development there are at least two fundamental
*  drivers not just one.
*  The one that they talk about is innovation and innovation is being a fundamental driver
*  of growth and there's a lot of truth to that in the history of the world but there's
*  a second fundamental aspect when we look out in the world and say who's doing well, who's
*  doing badly, why and so forth and that's what is sometimes called catching up and the
*  phenomenon of catching up is very different from the phenomenon of forging ahead at the
*  front of the technology horizon and when you take that simple distinction it helps to explain
*  a lot of the post-1960 question that you're asking.
*  The most successful countries in the world in the last 50 years have been basically the
*  East Asian economies and Southeast Asian economies. They don't look, very rarely do they look
*  like the textbook model of Osomoglu and Robinson of the free market economy and so forth. In
*  fact the People's Republic of China they characterize as just well that's an anomaly that is going
*  to collapse in the future so we don't have to explain it now. I think that's a huge mistake
*  and a misunderstanding of the basics. China's in a catching up mode. The institutions of
*  catching up are quite different from the institutions of being the technology leader for example.
*  But just understanding that would give them a little more clarity about institutions per
*  se.
*  And corruption over or underrated as a driver of growth?
*  It depends. Some places are so corrupt you first want to step foot in them and I've
*  had the experience repeatedly when I'm talking to head of state or finance minister and I
*  watch their eyes glaze over and realize they're not interested in what you're talking about.
*  They're in a different game. And those places can be driven absolutely into the ground by
*  corruption. Other places have been corrupt for a long time. I'm thinking of New York,
*  Washington, Lagos, Beijing and other places and you get a lot of economic progress. So
*  in that sense there is no purity in the world and I'm not a fan of corruption for a lot
*  of reasons starting with the ethics.
*  China is massively corrupt and it's grown at high rates right?
*  China has a lot of corruption. First person to say it is President Xi and the US has a
*  huge amount of corruption and it has done reasonably well over the last 200 years.
*  Let me now ask you a question to challenge the audience and we're going to turn to
*  Paul Rosenstein Rodin who's somewhat of a forgotten figure but I think still an important
*  figure at George Mason and maybe for you too. So as you know, Rosenstein Rodin was a development
*  economist. He was one of the pioneers of the notion of the big push of an extended
*  move forward on many fronts all at the same time. But when you look at the early years
*  of his thought, he studied with Mises, he worked with Hayek, he was an Austrian, he
*  was a subjectivist, methodological individualist and he made some kind of theoretical shift
*  in his mind. So what is it that you think that Paul Rosenstein Rodin saw and presumably
*  you think you see it as well that the people today who are still Austrians at the theoretical
*  level, what is it that Rosenstein Rodin saw that allowed him to make that shift or induced
*  him to make that shift at the most basic conceptual level?
*  He was writing during and at the end of World War II and he was saying how are we going
*  to get out of this mess? There are so many pieces that have to be put together. We have
*  to get infrastructure built again. We have to get basic markets operating. There are
*  a lot of interconnected pieces and so we're going to have to move on a lot of fronts.
*  So he was facing a historical situation and I would say that his idea, I'd go back even
*  well, actually it's not back, it was almost contemporaneous with Alexander Gershinkrone
*  who was a very clever economic historian at Harvard. I came as a student just as he was
*  retiring. He was a great mid-century, mid-20th century economic historian. He observed that
*  what countries do for development depends on how they stand in relation to the leader.
*  And this is a point I was making earlier which is that catching up is a fundamental phenomenon
*  in development. And there's a difference of growth which we study as an economy, how does
*  it grow from the question of catching up which is a question for a country that is situated
*  with weak technology, weak infrastructure, weak training and so forth in the face of
*  advanced economies. What should they do? Now that's been a question that's been asked
*  for at least 224 years since Alexander Hamilton sent his book, The Greatest War in the World.
*  It was his letter to the Congress on manufacturing in the United States because he said we have
*  to catch up with Britain and then Friedrich List said we have to catch up with Britain.
*  And economic reformers from basically Hamilton on in countries that were lagging behind the
*  lead said what do we do to catch up? Now you can carry this too far because the insane
*  version of this and the unbelievably destructive version of this was Lenin and Stalin. We have
*  to do anything at no matter what cost of life to catch up or Mao in the great leap forward
*  which is insanity and cruelty. But on the other hand the idea that you do different
*  things to catch up by accelerating the process or by making the big push in a variety of
*  ways has been shown time and again to have a lot of merit. And so it's a balance once
*  more. The first countries to develop Britain and the United States, take the U.S. We've
*  achieved almost continuous 1.8% per year per capita growth for the last 200 years. Not
*  bad if you do it for 200 years. But if you're an impoverished country today and you say
*  what's our aim 1.8% growth? No, our aim is 10% growth because we really need to catch
*  up. And it turned out because of that catching up phenomenon you can make a very, very rapid
*  advance in a way unthinkable for a country in front. But how do you make that advance
*  through pure government just stepping back and letting things happen? No, through a concerted
*  policy to close gaps. That's the difference. I've been reviewing your work including
*  these books and a stack of papers here which is a small fraction of what you've written.
*  I believe they all have your name on them. And what I try to do with thinkers sometimes
*  is boil down what they've been writing to the smallest number of dimensions possible.
*  So if you'll bear with me for a moment I'm going to try to do that with you and then
*  you tell me where I'm off or what you would add to that. So reviewing all the things you've
*  written. You probably know more about me than I do so let's see. Well maybe. Let's see how
*  it goes. But there are two phrases that strike me again and again. One is when you mention
*  your wife Sonia and talk about differential diagnostics and the other is what you call
*  the epoch of the Anthropocene which you could think of as the time when human beings are
*  in the world in an active way. So when we start with primitive society everything is
*  determined by geography and resources. And economic development in a sense is an ongoing
*  process where human beings impose their will and their reason on the world in a kind of
*  planning or volunteeristic fashion. And then there's a belief that first this needs to
*  be done in a differential way not the same recipe everywhere but a belief in the power
*  of human reason to perform these differential diagnostics to turn this era when humans are
*  on the earth into a time when we're no longer ruled by resources and geography and the prevalence
*  of malaria but brought into an era where human reason is in some sense running the show.
*  And if I had to boil down my reread of you into a very short bulletin that's what I would
*  say. Now do you agree with that? How would you change it and what would you add to that?
*  Well that's pretty good first of all so I would subscribe to that summary. I should
*  explain this idea of clinical economics as I've called it or differential diagnosis.
*  When you're married to a pediatrician as I have been for 35 wonderful years you get
*  up in the middle of the night a lot when patients call with a very sick child and I've listened
*  to my wife take an oral history thousands of times perhaps and it's a wonderful art
*  first of all because a mother calls with a crisis of a baby or young child usually a
*  high fever and the first thing that is important to know is that there are a thousand possible
*  etiologies of that fever. So my wife doesn't say institutions she says it depends let's
*  hear your problem oh you're in a desert you're here you're this no when it comes to the
*  child it could be something as normal as a common cold or something as devastating as
*  meningitis and the purpose of a differential diagnosis is two things first is that it's
*  it is of course to try to get to the core reasons so that you can make a proper prescription
*  based on a proper diagnosis. Second it's done in a way that you're minimizing serious
*  risk. The first question always that my wife asks is is the baby's neck stiff or do you
*  notice that because that's one of the symptoms of meningitis and if that if she's if the
*  mother answers that way the next point is I'll meet you at the emergency room don't
*  stop just go because it could be something that is fulminant and life threatening immediately
*  if it's not that then it can go on for an hour but by the way it's not just an hour
*  of questions it's an hour of sequence questions down a decision tree and it's fascinating
*  to watch and I wish as economists we had those basic skills in bread I certainly didn't
*  learn them and it took me a long time of seeing lots of patients to see that one needs that
*  same kind of approach so that's what I mean by differential diagnosis and why it's so
*  annoying to me the one explanation fits all viewpoints because now I've seen a lot of
*  places a lot of crises a lot of challenges and one of the things that I discovered was
*  how poor our profession is at times in having that sense that the problem that you saw over
*  there is not the same as the problem that you're seeing here now let me push on this
*  a bit yeah see if I if you can convert me into being more of a Saxion so one of my worries
*  is that the doctors are not actually in charge it may be the lawyers which is we're in a
*  law school but still if I may say in some ways a step down and to some extent you have
*  people voting on the baby not all of whom even know who the baby is or what the baby
*  symptoms are so the differential diagnostics may exist in a kind of platonic realm but
*  you're more optimistic about them than I am so what would you tell me to address my skepticism
*  and make me more of a Saxion given that I have this reluctance to embrace your view
*  the way you hold it well I think I get what you're driving at and I do have a fundamental
*  view of at least how I want to proceed professionally and but it's also based a bit on a theory
*  of change and tell us that theory and I believe that knowledge matters and that the more clarity
*  the more evidence the more appropriate an analysis the more likely we can find a good
*  outcome to things so many people are cynical I tend not to be I'm sometimes accused of
*  being gullible as a result or being too soft in the face of whatever but I believe that
*  there's a way to reach an agreement typically among pretty conflictual and often pretty
*  antagonistic actors I tend to believe there's a way out of a crisis and I tend to believe
*  that a lot of what poses as either pure zero some struggle or a harsh ideological conflict
*  is often resolvable by good clear ideas or good clear evidence or a good clear game plan
*  so you're very optimistic about the power of human reason I believe that's where we
*  should put our bets at the different claims the I believe we should put our bets on human
*  reason it's all we have but I'm not necessarily that we don't have to even disagree because
*  we're going to act the same way let me mention this book reading this book it really cleared
*  up for me I think a lot of the things you believe it's called to move the world JFK's
*  quest for peace came out last year it's received attention but less so from economists for
*  obvious reasons and it's a book about leaders sitting down and just doing something and
*  basically getting it right is that fair to say solving more or less solving the Cuban
*  Missile Crisis diffusing tensions avoiding nuclear war right it's a book yes of this
*  remarkable last year of Kennedy's life which included the Cuban Missile Crisis and then
*  have negotiating the partial nuclear test ban treaty and it's basically I find it a
*  story of tremendous insight and very moving also but it's a story if I could put it in
*  pure conceptual jargon it's a story of finding a way to the cooperative outcome of a prisoner's
*  dilemma and that's to my mind a crucial structural feature of our lives which is that
*  we face constantly this challenge of finding agreement and we face constantly the logic
*  of defection as it's called in the prisoner's dilemma or the non-cooperative outcome that's
*  worse for everybody and the question is what to do about that and the cynics say well the
*  world's bound to disagree and the idealists say the world will always agree or we should
*  always act that way and I find fascinating and compelling the idea that we should try
*  to find ways to move to cooperation knowing how fragile that is and this story it really
*  fits your model of change that's why reading the book it was like a light bulb went off
*  in my head well for me it also went off in my head as I learned more about this which
*  is that Kennedy and Khrushchev stumbled into nuclear war and they were in the middle of
*  nearly the end of the world in October 1962 and Kennedy made his share of terrible mistakes
*  and our USG which I'm usually not too much of a fan of made its share of terrible mistakes
*  whether it's being pigs or other things and one by one we stumbled not to the desire of
*  either of these leaders to the point where we were within the hairs breath of total annihilation
*  and so many stupid things happen in this world as almost happened again some pilot gets lost
*  over Alaska and flies over the Soviet Union or Russian local commanders in Cuba have the
*  power to fire nuclear weapons you know we're so close to the edge so the Cuban Missile
*  Crisis is diffused I think with real humanity by Kennedy and by Khrushchev and then they
*  both basically reach the intuition this is insane the way we're acting this is crazy
*  and they find a way to reach an agreement next year and it's an agreement in which
*  typically the right on both sides that they face or the hardliners the nationalists on
*  both sides say you can't agree with each other and they find a way to reach an agreement
*  so to me it is a paradigm of how we can stay alive in this world and actually get somewhere
*  if I thought more problems were of an evolutionary nature had very large numbers of players didn't
*  have clear channels of communications didn't have elite advisors but were more of just
*  a big messy splat should I then be more pessimistic about differential diagnostics or do you think
*  that as a model of social change still is going to hold well for me the biggest most
*  complicated mess that we're in that is like the one you're describing is climate change
*  which in my now forty three years of thinking about economics so it's a long time is the
*  most complicated mess that I can imagine it's got every attribute of just a terrible terrible
*  problem it's global it's long term it's uncertain it's got vested interests it's got hugely
*  unequal payoffs it's got everything wrong with it as a problem and yet so a lot of people
*  do say there's no chance we're just you can't really do much if you ask me where do I see
*  that I say we can solve this problem there is a way to do it I would define solving it
*  at this stage as staying below the two degrees Celsius warming which governments have agreed
*  but not honored as an upper limit of warming and I'm taking an approach of how I think
*  I can contribute to that in a very particular way and that way is by helping to define more
*  clearly what that path involves and managing a fifteen country project for the UN on defining
*  pathways that satisfy that so to my mind that reflects at least my style of what I believe
*  is the way to do this which is to say well what does the solution look like it comes
*  back to what Schelling called a focal point for bargaining here's where we could go I
*  think that is very important to identify in messy situations here's where we can get to
*  and don't you see for all of us that's an improvement that's better than the mess that
*  we're on and I believe if you say that enough and you're clear enough about it you'll actually
*  get there or not really but you'll have the best chance of getting there and that that's
*  a style of problem solving that we should try to use in these non cooperative games
*  that we play so called which is that there is no magic answer there is no one leader
*  that defines the solution we have to actually agree on something and it seems to me to be
*  a good idea to try to agree on something to pick a success from the past let me mention
*  Poland my opinion Poland has gone very well it's a great country it's been a success
*  if I made the following claim would you agree with it that you Jeffrey Sachs have done more
*  for economic liberty through the medium and history of Poland than almost any other economist
*  alive today true or false I'd say that things I recommended were that was good advice I
*  gave back then and I'm proud of it and it worked out and it was a very remarkable period
*  of my life and very remarkable moment and it was exactly one of these periods when you're
*  just struck at the complexity and the mess and one needed to find a way out of that and
*  just to tie that strategy in with how I'm explaining my general approach actually you
*  know I made recommendations for a significant rapid change of the economy and I think that
*  the economic institutions structure and politics that had a very big effect in the internal
*  dynamics of what was happening and the international dynamics but the basic idea of course was
*  not mine at all the basic idea was in the historical moment and the basic idea was also
*  solidarity movements idea and here's what I mean I was asked at one point write a plan
*  and it was for me an unbelievable moment which I remember as vividly as anything I remember
*  because I said I'll send this to you in a couple of weeks it was one of Lech Wales top
*  advisors said I need it tomorrow morning and so one of the great life experiences that
*  is the lessons of four years of Harvard all-nighters so I pulled an all-nighter and I wrote a plan
*  for transforming Poland from a communist central planned economy to a market economy and if
*  anyone's interested I'll send you the document which I recovered from a box sometime a few
*  years ago and what he told me was he said I don't care what you put I mean you have
*  to explain it but this has to be about Poland's return to Europe that was the message was
*  like given a term paper or a one-nighter write your essay on how Poland can return to Europe
*  well for me that defined everything first it was the right idea it was why I was there
*  it was why I was wanting to help solidarity at the time it was what I believed in but
*  it also defined they had a clear vision we want to be a normal country in Europe and
*  they are right and they are now completely it's totally normal is one of the leader
*  one of the greatest leaders of our time human rights Adam McNich said we're boring you
*  know they went from the great drama of revolution to being a boring country in Europe but the
*  point I want to make Tyler is that the endpoint was clear for them well everything else fits
*  once you have an idea of that compelling focal point then I said okay you know like the guy
*  carving an elephant out of ice take away everything that doesn't look like an elephant take away
*  everything that doesn't look like a European normal economy and then Russia which I blame
*  only on the Russians by the way but they never had a comparable endpoint in mind is that
*  fair to say I think there are two things I blame a lot of it on Dick Cheney so not just
*  on Russia Russia itself by virtue of Russia 11 time zones of the Eurasian landmass does
*  not have a fixed focal point and half of Russian history is how we're a unique civilization
*  the third Rome and half of Russian history is being part of Europe and being part of
*  European civilization they've never settled that question until now but the other difference
*  which I found I didn't understand it then almost at all by the way and it took me 20
*  years to understand it actually was how weird it was that in 1989 and this is geopolitics
*  which I didn't understand as it was happening in 1989 I made recommendations for Poland
*  and I said many you know several unusual things like don't pay your debts get debt cancellation
*  you need emergency billion dollars on this date and so forth and everything I recommended
*  actually ended up happening with US government support then in Russia two years later I was
*  asked by Gorbachev and then by Yeltsin to help them because they saw what was happening
*  in Poland they liked that they wanted something similar so I said exactly the same things
*  and the US government kept saying no no way no way and I kept saying but that kept working
*  there and it was and I didn't understand it in some deep sense for a long long time
*  how weird this was I knew it wasn't the difference of economic advice I understand what a financial
*  crisis is culturally weird you mean no how weird it was in the historical moment that
*  things that had worked extremely well had shown themselves where I had had Brent Scowcroft
*  and Bob Dole and others strongly supporting it all of a sudden just no support from Washington
*  the IMF saying we're not going to do this and I said but Bob Richard Irvin sorry you
*  did that two years ago in Poland we're not going to do it why flat okay what's the
*  what's the lesson of this quite important actually it's a little bit off off topic
*  but very important we didn't want to help Russia in 1991 we wanted our unipolar world
*  I didn't know that at the time for me I wanted to help Russia this is a chance for freedom
*  democracy market economy normalcy Yeltsin defined he said December 11 when I met him
*  the first time 1991 we want to be a normal country I said I will help you Mr. President
*  I we didn't want that in this country so what I didn't understand was everything I said
*  about Poland was immediately accepted because it was good advice and because Poland was
*  going to be a bulwark of NATO everything I said about Russia didn't matter whether it
*  was good advice or not Russia was on the other side but China did it without us without American
*  help for the most part so what what is it there about Russia that meant Russia couldn't
*  do it so the problem was not like a Khrushchev Kennedy dialogue but Russia must have failed
*  in some other way where China more or less did not and what what is that element many
*  things first of all Russia faced in 1991 in extremely acute financial crisis and the first
*  if you haven't lived through a deep deep deep financial crisis it's hard to understand
*  what it is now we've lived through something mild like that in 2008 which was frightening
*  enough but I've now seen them many times and studied them for my whole career and they're
*  very fulminant they're like that meningitis epidemic they absolutely can rip a society
*  apart before you turn around Russia had that it had that for all sorts of reasons but one
*  was that the price of oil had declined to ten dollars a barrel and Gorbachev had borrowed
*  tens of billions of dollars from 1985 to 1991 and ran out of money and so they ran out of
*  reserves at the end of 1991 so this was a macro macro crisis and it was a very bad one
*  and I the same thing had happened in Poland in a different time dimension but by 1989
*  so that's why I called for debt cancellation that standstill on debt payments and emergency
*  stabilization fund so the first point is financial crisis is in and of itself a distinct category
*  of pathology Russia had it China thank goodness for them didn't have it Russia needed help
*  on a financial crisis so that's number one by the time they got out of the financial
*  crisis which was several years later because we completely stuck it to them in amazing
*  ways and allowed the crisis to be fulminant for a number of years the reformers were gone
*  the corruption was completely out of control so I don't want to exonerate the Russians
*  for the irresponsibility and so on and the lack of good strategy but often in the historical
*  context to solve a problem you need more than just you need both sides operating there
*  are other serious differences very major differences that are worth just mentioning we could go
*  into length but there's a big difference of being an industrial urban industrial broken
*  Soviet economy which was the industrializing eventually which you know had so overgrown
*  the industry heavy industry and it was in a lot of collapse versus being an agrarian
*  impoverished country as China was in 1978 so the pathways were bound to be very very
*  different the geography is different by the way because China is just filled with people
*  who could do low-cost labor right at the ports on the east coast of China whereas for Russia
*  it's almost basically a landlocked landmass that was running off of petroleum which had
*  collapsed in global price which had collapsed in the physical facilities in the countryside
*  with collapsing steel mills collapsing everything was a rust it just looked like a waste dump
*  in 1991 when you went around Russia absolutely cannibalized airplanes at every airport just
*  rusting away ton after ton of steel rusting away wherever you turned cement melting away
*  wherever you turned the place had just been a heavy industrial machine for the military
*  industrial complex for decades and let's do some quick question and response I'll
*  name some things you tell me if you think they're underrated or overrated charter
*  cities concept haven't seen any result of it are you hopeful powers of human reason
*  power is a human reason khrushchev kennedy sit down look cities are important if you're
*  talking about Paul Romer's concept yes among others I think I think they're and I have
*  to put it this way I'm happy for the idea of cities to say we should do something different
*  I'm not happy to say we're going to take an extra territorial place in your country
*  it's not going to be governed locally it's going to have an external board there are
*  lots of specific features that never struck me as politically realistic and they didn't
*  turn out to be realistic so export import bank overrated or underrated I'd vote for
*  it you'd vote to keep it I'd vote to keep it even though it's corporate welfare yeah
*  okay and anthropologist because it basically sells useful things to places that need useful
*  things and I believe that in general our international capital markets underperform
*  their role of financing international flows so I think we need institutions to overcome
*  the inherent shortcomings of international finance anthropologists anthropologists they're
*  often critical of economists and development you're an economist so am I in a very broad
*  sense you're representing the profession a lot of anthropologists criticize what economists
*  do at a pretty broad level are you persuaded by what they say or not first of all I think
*  that anthropology in the form of getting a very deep texture thick description of a society
*  is a very important kind of approach one of many second we need an anthropology of economics
*  in the original literal sense of the word which is a theory of man much better than
*  we have we have an 18th century theory of humanity in a world of 20th century evolutionary
*  psychology neuroscience and and a century of psychological understanding so we need
*  a new anthropology in our field the economy of Mexico overrated or underrated it's probably
*  accurately rated which is and really strangely underperforming for a long time with a lot
*  of difficulty but a hundred million people living in a kind of middle income stasis and
*  probably really facing the the curse of so far from God so near to the United States
*  the paradox that somehow the U.S. has created as many problems as it's created opportunities
*  it has created a militarized narcotics trafficking and war on drugs for example which has been
*  devastating for Mexico in modern times if I said this the core problem in Mexico is
*  there's too much labor in the informal sector productivity in the formal sector is often
*  remarkably high Mexico will become number three for auto exports they're going to pass
*  South Korea but you can only squeeze so much more in productivity gains out of the formal
*  sector and moving from the informal sector to the formal sector for labor is a slow process
*  it goes on slowly that's what we see and to accelerate that Mexico needs in some ways
*  to deregulate would you agree or disagree I don't know Mexico is a little bit I would
*  say just stepping back a little bit of a mystery for me why it hasn't done better in development
*  let's talk about Africa now you must know Danny Roderick's work he and I maybe you
*  too he's worried about premature deindustrialization that in the old days countries like the U.S.
*  would have over a quarter of their labor force working in manufacturing with middle class
*  jobs often be democratic and then they would deindustrialize the new world would be a little
*  wave of emerging economies were often seeing them deindustrialize at 10 to 15 percent of
*  the workforce being in manufacturing and it may be that service sector jobs for cultural
*  economic reasons some reasons don't give you the same kind of enduring increasing returns
*  ongoing self-reinforcing economic growth so when it comes to Africa or other parts of the
*  world are you worried about premature deindustrialization not very much why not you know I don't think
*  that there's any magic to manufacturing what there is crucially is a need for all developing
*  countries to export you need to export because you need to import technology manufacturing
*  has been a route to export earnings to earning a place in the world that allows you to import
*  the technology which 99.9 percent comes from outside your country so the question to ask
*  for Africa is how is it going to pay its way in the world not whether it's going to have
*  manufacturing or not and that's why by the way import substituting manufacturing was
*  no no great help for countries that pursued that to an excess what has worked is export
*  oriented manufacturing so maybe it'll be export oriented services mining agribusiness
*  and other things in general if I ask the question is Africa disadvantaged by having to catch
*  up today versus having to catch up 25 years ago net net I'd say better off now because
*  the basic tools for catching up with the information age are stronger now than before but when
*  you say mining I worry about your own resource curse when you say services India has done
*  this to some extent as we all know but if you look at Indian service exports they're
*  often done out of a kind of feudal bastion almost companies which build their own roads
*  their own infrastructure almost like small private cities and if you're inside that sphere
*  it works pretty well for you but it's actually a very small segment of the Indian population
*  and that space they have a head start there so if you think what percent of the Nigerian
*  workforce can be employed exporting services I mean do you think there's an argument it
*  could be more than three or four percent I think the question of how any low income country
*  pays its way in the world as I said is an is a real question if it weren't for that
*  question there is no shortage of identifiable jobs that Africa needs for the coming two
*  generations it needs teachers and it needs doctors and it needs construction workers
*  and it needs engineers and it needs a public administration and it needs everything because
*  it's coming from poor rural at overwhelming lay agriculture so I'm not worried about
*  the job route but what I am worried about is the balance of payments basically which
*  is that like any of us we thrive if we can sell our services somehow and that's true
*  at a country level as it is at an individual level and if you are a in an environment where
*  you have nothing to sell you may have a comparative advantage but if you have nothing to sell
*  it doesn't matter everybody every place has a comparative advantage but it doesn't
*  necessarily make you prosperous so I worry very much about places like Chad Niger Central
*  African Republic Mali because they're landlocked they are in incredibly difficult physical
*  geographic conditions very dry drying most likely warming massive disease burden no
*  most of them with no easy natural resource base too far from ports to do any kind of
*  assembly operations as a stepping stone development so just extraordinarily difficult it's why
*  I also worry about Africa Africa's demographic trends because obviously I think a lot about
*  the difficulties of development and you're you're mentioning some but I think they're
*  going to be as hard as it is for Africa now with with 1 billion people in in Sub-Saharan
*  Africa Africa is going to have 2 billion people before the middle of the century on the current
*  trajectory and it's going to have around 4 billion people on the so-called medium variant
*  fertility trajectory that the UN population division puts forward and I find sustainable
*  development in Africa in those terms not feasible I couldn't answer that question
*  what is a viable path so when you think about the problems of development in very poor difficult
*  conditions as much of Sub-Saharan Africa has right now the best thing going forward is
*  this tremendous room for catching up and that means a lot of leapfrogging technologies
*  and the fact that there is a true phenomenal wonderful powerful information revolution
*  underway of which were just in the early stages were still on the the first slope of the S
*  curve in that and that's great but there are huge headwinds of which I would say demography
*  and climate change are two plus the traditional facts for a lot of Africa disease tropical
*  if very difficult tropical environment and 14 landlocked countries all of which make
*  this a very special problem.
*  Let me give you another Danny Rodrik argument he says that once countries get a foothold
*  in manufacturing their productivity levels converge pretty quickly but that in agriculture
*  it takes much longer you probably looked at the same numbers it at least seems true to
*  me do you agree with this and do you think it's a major problem facing Africa and if
*  so what should they do about it?
*  Well it's an example of the ecological context and geography being important the reason you
*  can get manufacturing convergence of productivity easily is that those are standardized technologies
*  usually part of international value chains the specs and the equipment and the machinery
*  don't come domestically they come internationally the procedures the everything about the production
*  systems are basically part of an international system when it comes to agriculture in a completely
*  different world what counts is your soil your pests your climate conditions your crop varieties
*  locally and that's why technological diffusion in agriculture is much more complex you cannot
*  simply take most of the time something that worked here and planted here the miracle of
*  the double miracle of the Indian Green Revolution was actually two miracles one was that crop
*  yields went up quickly but second that they were from seeds from Sonora Mexico that Norman
*  Borlaug had taken to India and low and behold after one year of a little bit of experimentation
*  on how to plant them he and MS Swaminathan found that you could use Mexican seeds in
*  the Indian context in the Punjab so the point that Roderick may be emphasizing here is or
*  finding implicitly is that technologies diffuse at different rates depending on their capacity
*  for standardization and manufacturing is typically a very standardized global process you can
*  make the phones if you're making the phones you're making the same phones whether it's
*  in Thailand or in China and Foxcom or wherever it is whereas if you're controlling disease
*  your disease burdens are different your ecology is different if you're growing food it's
*  different and therefore the context is much more complex of all the wonderful music in
*  Africa you must have heard a lot of it what's your favorite drums from which part of course
*  everywhere no it's beautiful you and basically it's a truism and obvious but how much of
*  American music is African music so we have we live on a culture that came from Africa
*  through the Caribbean to jazz to so much and when you watch African music you see so much
*  of the heritage roots and improvements of culture and music that you see here from all
*  countries what's your favorite novel or which novel has influenced you the most and how
*  has it shaped your thinking and how does it tie into the other points we've been discussing
*  Peter Thiel said Lord of the Rings and Master and Margarita I'm a complete sucker for Dr.
*  Zhivago and what is the show about Russians and their future I love the basic idea that
*  in the midst of this revolution Zhivago said somebody has to just live and so it's the
*  most human wonderful story I am a complete sucker for it China and Chinese demography
*  what will happen with China now and what do they need to do what's happened of fundamental
*  significance for the world is that East Asia has become the third growth pole in the world
*  or arguably the second because for the first 200 years of modern economic growth it was
*  all the North Atlantic you could call that two regions or one depending on how you want
*  to define it but it was the US and Europe that defined 90% of the technological advance
*  that created the underlying dynamics to which the whole rest of the world would engage in
*  catching up or integration or falling under imperial rule or whatever it was now because
*  of the long history of Japanese development because of the 50 year history of Korean and
*  Taiwanese Hong Kong Singapore development and especially because of the post 1978 scale
*  of China's achievement East Asia is a absolutely key transformative growth pole of the world
*  and this I think is a fundamental geopolitical and historical and economic significance but
*  is China crashing now there's a real estate bubble a lot of provincial debt funny numbers
*  excess capacity what's your take my take is that China will be a great and successful
*  country in the 21st century summers and land Pritchett say China will slow down and grow
*  at 4% if they're lucky do you agree summers and land Pritchett have been wrong about China
*  for 20 years and they continue to be so you can and Krugman too they all there was this
*  feeling in Cambridge for some reason 25 years ago we don't like East Asia too much I'm
*  caricaturing just a little bit and China's a bubble the myth of the East Asian miracle
*  remember Krugman's article and so forth they just got it wrong time and again they have
*  failed to understand and same with Osomoglu it's the same story it doesn't fit our model
*  exactly so it can't happen it's got to collapse it's not right it's happening that's the
*  story of our time it's happening that's one and a half billion two billion people two
*  billions say including other parts of Southeast Asia they're on an upswing and that's great
*  it's wonderful it's the most significant scaled improvement of material conditions in the
*  history of the world in a short period of time and it's deep and it's great civilizations
*  great cultures great capacity and you think they'll keep growing at 7% or not too far
*  from that number I think that the general idea of Robert Barrow from 20 years ago that
*  every time you approach by half the way to the frontier you lose about two percentage
*  points of growth is about right and it will apply to them and of course what's your biggest
*  disagreement with Krugman today well today yesterday's column please tell us more he
*  wrote a ridiculous column yesterday but again but what do you disagree with it's an interesting
*  story yesterday he wrote about how horrible the UK government has been and how they're
*  going to possibly win an election by telling the story that they've done a decent job
*  economically he's had a kind of venom for the government my response which I'll publish
*  soon is called something like Krugman's anti-Cameron vitriol because it really is vitriolic and
*  what I did was just put the UK recovery next to the US recovery and they look almost identical
*  and he loves the Obama recovery and he hates the UK and he says one's awful one's great
*  it's ideology it's not fact driven and you're more skeptical about fiscal stimulus than
*  he is right well he has told his readers two times a week for five years the simplest way
*  version of the crudest Keynesian model which is the way out of a downturn is fiscal stimulus
*  I don't I've worked on macroeconomic adjustment programs in dozens of countries and for 35
*  years I don't buy it and so I think he really took a complicated subject and said there's
*  one answer and it comes back to the same approach differential diagnostics yeah and basically
*  by the way he did in my view two things wrong he misdiagnosed the 2008 crisis and second
*  then gave the wrong prescription to it and the misdiagnosis in my view is that it was
*  not a Keynesian animal spirits crisis meaning that suddenly there was just a collapse of
*  investment and you needed fiscal stimulus to undo it it was two things I would say it
*  was if you want to you know if you want to classify it it was a Hayekian displacement
*  from a credit boom but even that wasn't enough to lead to a crisis it was Lehman Brothers
*  failing in September 14 2008 that drove a financial panic and addressing a financial
*  panic is a condition that needs to be addressed as its own pathology and when you that's
*  my view that if you approached it that way because I remember arguing with Summers that
*  weekend and many weekends after that approach it as unlocking the financial panic not as
*  the need for reaching a 1.6 trillion dollar deficit in 2009 just get credit going again
*  in that case I think Bernanke by the way did the right thing which was flood the market
*  with liquidity make extraordinary purchases QE all the rest I thought was the right policy
*  in 2008-9 not the fiscal stimulus because I didn't think it would work I didn't think
*  it was necessary I thought it would lead to big diversion of attention and public investment
*  actually from longer term things which in a way is how I would interpret our recent
*  political history in other words Obama used his political capital for the wrong thing
*  in that fiscal stimulus but in any event I have disagreed with Krugman all through
*  these years about this and he kept saying we're in a depression we're in a depression
*  and then when we started to recover I said we're recovering and no no we're still
*  in a depression and then when we really recovered he said just as I said we recovered because
*  we had this 2009 stimulus we recovered in the context of a significant fiscal cut actually
*  not what he recommended because fiscal policy wasn't the decisive element of this business
*  cycle we have about five minutes left I'll give you two questions and you can divvy up
*  the time for them as you wish the first is to tell us a bit about your new work on rise
*  of the robots and also do you view this as a description of what's happening already
*  or a prediction for the future and second tell us how to fix graduate education and
*  economics the floor is yours we'll also learn something about your priorities.
*  So robots.
*  It may be the same answer for both.
*  Very quick yeah robots could teach our classes too very quick on robots fascinating I'm
*  a you know I'm a techno file and a techno believer and I do believe that we are in a
*  very rapid ascent of information technology and I believe that it is displacing lots of
*  jobs and that it is one of the reasons for the low wages the stagnation of real earnings
*  in the economy because the path of manufacturing employment which we talked about has shrunk
*  considerably chronically more will come it will also in it will also spread through the
*  service economy as well you don't need baristas in Starbucks we will walk in soon to a Starbucks
*  and our iris will be scanned and your default mode of a mocha latte venti will come out
*  automatically of a machine and you'll take it out the other door and they'll predict
*  which days you're going to come even right.
*  Pardon me.
*  They'll predict which days you're going to come.
*  Yeah they'll have a very good idea they'll welcome you by name of course as you arrive
*  but we were expecting you were ten minutes late is everything okay Mr. Sass and because
*  Google will know where you are any moment anyway so that's coming and it will transfer
*  transform fundamentally the labor market now the interesting conceptual question is
*  is this a good thing or a bad thing now as economists we should say instinctively it's
*  a great thing are you kidding we can have the robots do all the work for us and I believe
*  that's what we've hoped for ever since leaving Eden you know when we were condemned to work
*  in the fields ten thousand years ago in the Neolithic Revolution we've been trying to
*  escape heavy labor and if the robots will do it fantastic but there is this actually
*  deep conceptual question which is what is it there is something right actually theoretically
*  about the argument that the demand for labor falls the wages decline and that can actually
*  lead to a downward spiral in our economies and so I have another I have a paper that
*  from last year with Larry Kotlikoff showing how that works I have another paper coming
*  out in a couple weeks that I really like showing in an overlapping generations context how
*  you can get weird outcomes but what's always true is that with enough government intervention
*  redistribution of various kinds from old to young for example from capital owners to labor
*  owners of course you can make everybody better off because of pure technological change by
*  definition if properly handled can make everybody better off so this question of how we're
*  going to handle this transition is a really interesting one I believe it's happening
*  I believe it's a fascinating subject for analysis and research and I believe it's not been studied
*  in very much depth yet and that leads me to the second question because it is a good segue
*  what do we learn in economics and I believe not the right things and I'll take just this
*  question in my view whether it's the geography questions or the manufacturing question that
*  you ask about or the robotics or whatever it is what's fascinating for us in our real
*  lives and in our societal choices is the change that we're constantly living in during this
*  past 230 years since Watt gave us the steam engine and we've been in 230 years of relentless
*  change technological change structural change societal change cultural change and yet our
*  economics models are basically static meant to be timeless and if we really want to understand
*  the world we need to go deep into understanding what Baxter is doing or how Watson Baxter
*  the robot or Watson or what really is changing technologically now what would you do with
*  them so economics we avoid that I think conceptually because if you study anything too specific
*  it's out of date in 10 years so we study general principles I think that's epistemologically
*  the weakness of our field because we want to be the four underlying natural forces of
*  the social universe rather than studying specifics so more like the anthropologists no more like
*  the biologists so if what and Watson and Crick had written their 1953 paper saying assume
*  N base pairs and they can they can match by N times N minus one over two combinations
*  it wouldn't be a very good model of DNA but they actually said there are four base pairs
*  and there are two natural matchings and it happens to be a double helix and we're going
*  to study the detail out of that for the next 40 years yeah it's arbitrary you know there
*  could be other DNA but we're going to study this one now economists don't do that because
*  we have a harder job actually in some sense which is that we're not studying a stable
*  environment we're studying a changing environment so whatever we study in depth will be out
*  of date we're looking at a moving target to compensate for that by never getting into
*  detail has been our approach but we're always behind the curve then we never have good answers
*  when they're needed and tell us and that's what I would like us to study I would like
*  economists to be working with engineers to be working with public health to be working
*  with the medical professionals so that we're actually working on the real systems of our
*  time and adding our pieces to that but understanding and studying that so that we have an answer
*  to robotics not a pure theoretical model which is nice and fun but something that can be
*  helpful on that we will close the formal discussion thank you Jeff thanks we have a bit of time
*  for questions we take those at the two mics and I will alternate sides we accept good
*  questions only of course also please if you have a question make your way to the microphone
*  while people are going to the mic Peter Becky I see you in row two is there a question off
*  hand you would like to ask while you have the chance okay yes on this side should I
*  introduce myself first okay my name is Millette Daniel and I'm currently in the master's
*  program for international commerce and policy my question is regarding robotics potentially
*  or futuristically speaking taking over what would be like the low skilled jobs at first
*  what do you think the implications would be on immigration the effect on on immigration
*  due to the like changing labor market well you know yes the robotics are a kind of immigrants
*  so they're competing with they're competing with the other workers that provide some services
*  that are being replaced by by the machines or by the artificial intelligence system so
*  there is a big distributional effect in in my view those who own the robots as it were
*  whether it's Larry Page and and Sergey Brin or others make a fortune and those who own
*  the labor that is being substituted see a real decline of their income now again conceptually
*  the idea that machines could do the heavy lifting for us is a good thing for society
*  and I had I don't know if it's a real insight or not but I went to Virunga National Park
*  in Rwanda a couple of years ago to visit the great apes the gorillas and you spend
*  this remarkable time in the bamboo forest watching them what do they do all day they
*  play they lie around they eat some bamboo shoots a little sex now and then and they
*  lie around they eat some bamboo shoots a little sex now and then basically it's a
*  pretty leisurely existence we're told by anthropologists that that's not so much unlike hunter gatherer
*  societies in the pre-neolithic we got into a we got into a different mode about 10,000
*  years ago became sedentary human populations rose and for the next 10,000 years people
*  broke their backs trying to stay alive growing food so we got into a kind of mode where basically
*  very very very hard labor and the big quest of modern times is actually to get out of
*  that hard heavy physical labor that's what everyone in the world wants and as soon as
*  you can get out of agriculture people do that's why we're down to one percent of our labor
*  force in agriculture it's very hard work and when you watch people bent over for eight
*  hours in the fields in Africa today it's no joy for their lives it's extraordinarily
*  difficult I say all of this because what machines do what smart machines have been
*  doing for 200 years is allowing us to ease that physical burden and what robots we've
*  had robots for a long time now they're just getting smarter and smarter because they have
*  microprocessors now and artificial intelligence they're allowing humanity to escape from
*  a very heavy load so in principle this is a nice thing this is where we would like to
*  go but if it leads to turmoil massive inequalities of power and income and wealth or by the way
*  the other dystopian possibilities that which George Orwell depicted we already have a mass
*  surveillance state in this country probably not so far from here I hope they're listening
*  I expect every time I pick up the phone I used to say I know hello NSA I know you're
*  listening and then I was told it's probably six intelligence agencies listening now all
*  that's happening is like all the things we discussed I believe that artificial intelligence
*  robotics is real deep transformative potentially for the good possibly for the bad and therefore
*  a matter of analysis and choice on this side California governor Brown has recently discussed
*  water issues in California when I'm down in Texas they have dry lakes around Austin and
*  they're rationing the last two or three years around there I think you mentioned Africa
*  and the dryness in the countries how is water going to impact our global economies now and
*  is that being so the the water issue is a pervasive global issue colleagues of mine
*  published in PNAS a few weeks ago and then another article one on the fact that with
*  climate change the models show that the American Southwest and Great Plains are likely to dry
*  very very significantly during the 21st century the climate models basically show massive
*  water problems in many places in the world and for two big reasons many dry places now
*  which are often on the descending zone of convective forces like the Hadley cell become
*  drier with climate change because these convective forces become more powerful and second in
*  general with higher temperatures of apple transpiration is faster so the soils dry out
*  all of this means that water crises will intensify even without the climate change water stress
*  is pervasive because population increases and agricultural demands are huge we have
*  60,000 major dams in the world diverting runoff already and that means that places famous
*  places like the Aral Sea which dried out irrespective of the climate change in the past then I can
*  tell you about the recent research and it absolutely comports with what I see with my
*  own eyes in many places Syria had a huge drought the biggest in its modern history from 2006
*  to 10 it led to many social ramifications that contributed to the explosion of violence
*  starting in 2011 and this fact of these ecological crises turning into social catastrophes I
*  think is a very real phenomenon and we should not presume that somehow we'll just be able
*  to handle this stuff because I'm told constantly crisis leads to innovation and solution and
*  the truth is that's sometimes true and sometimes crisis leads to catastrophe.
*  What I'm going to do I think we have time for two more questions I'll take the two
*  sequentially and then Jeff can address the two together as he sees fit so don't answer
*  the first right away a question here a question there and then back to Jeff.
*  Yes.
*  Given that a goal of economic development policy is to help low income countries catch
*  up what do you believe the XM banks role and export subsidies more generally have an economic
*  development especially with the knowledge that many of the beneficiaries of XM assistance
*  are firms in countries with rich economies like Mexico, India, Hong Kong.
*  And the second question.
*  You said that economics should in a sense be more humble about its models and economists
*  tend to think that there's a certain knowledge of economics that they know that they have
*  a value added do you see that that is justified that economists their economic way of thinking
*  has some value added?
*  So I guess the question on XM bank I'll just make it more general the big returns that
*  to investment in the coming decades in my view are largely in the low and the middle
*  income countries not surprisingly because their capital scarce because they have a big
*  capacity to catch up they have a big human need also and so in an idealized world a tremendous
*  amount of finance would flow from the savings in high income countries to capital stock
*  in low and middle income countries of course some of that happens for instance to China
*  or to Mexico in the past but it's relatively constrained because there are huge institutional
*  barriers not the least of which is getting repaid for these loans when they're cross
*  border.
*  So institutions which facilitate that kind of international capital flow can be very
*  good at global improvement in my view we have too few of those that's why I'm constantly
*  arguing for both more aid which are grants but also more financing through institutions
*  because I think both of these can improve the human condition make the world safer help
*  poor countries get out of their crises and so forth and XM bank is a very good example
*  not my favorite institution but I think it's fine I think it should be improved there are
*  many specific issues of this financing which I'm not too keen on but I would like longer
*  term 20 or 30 year loans for infrastructure mainly to low income countries and XM bank
*  is a little bit of a model for that but we could do better.
*  In terms of what do economists know a lot is the economic growth is a very important
*  is the answer there is really a lot of powerful insights into two kinds of issues that are
*  core to economics one is managing scarce resources is a general problem and the second is how
*  markets function and so both of those are provide a wealth of useful knowledge for
*  human betterment but what economists tend not to do is to get into the details as it
*  were and we think that the general knowledge is sufficient and that I think is a mistake
*  because as I've tried to describe in our conversation now and as I've learned in 35 years of work
*  in the field in more than 125 countries the context is essential because we're dealing
*  with very complex phenomena and the complex phenomena do not lend themselves to slogans
*  or to easy answers or to single solutions they're more like engineering problems or
*  agronomy problems or health problems you have to understand the context the technologies
*  you have at hand the choice sets that you really have in order to be constructive in
*  this now there may be room for a few pure theorists in a field like this in my life
*  I've met a few brilliant geniuses very few who could sit in an office and think great
*  thoughts and contribute to the world it's a very small number by the way and then I've
*  met lots of people who generalize which doesn't move me because I don't find it helpful I
*  find it distracting or confusing or misguided or misplaced and so for most of us mortals
*  I think the deep engagement in real problems is crucial I wouldn't want to train doctors
*  without the medical students walking the wards with their mentors I don't like training
*  economists without them grappling with real problems in real places and learning the complexity
*  of the interacting physical technological political economic natural systems it's
*  the complexity of these interacting systems that defines how we need to respond we're
*  not training students that way we're training them in general principles or in very fancy
*  way statistical exercises that actually miss the point and just a final word about that
*  we have so much statistical machinery to ask the question what can you learn from this
*  data set but that's the wrong question because the data set is always a tiny tiny fraction
*  of what you can know about the problem that you're studying and so if you want to know
*  about the problem get out there and learn about it and don't think that you're going
*  to find it in your data set and for that we need a different kind of epistemological approach
*  and a different kind of teaching approach as well I want our students out on the hospital
*  wards as it were but that means being out in the world working and solving problems
*  and dealing with people across many different fields and many different parts of our social
*  systems to be able to aggregate to and integrate into meaningful holistic solutions.
*  Jeff has a new book out the age of sustainable development he'll be doing signings outside
*  at the reception and Jeff thank you again for so much of your time.
