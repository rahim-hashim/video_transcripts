# Chef Mark Miller on Food as the Ultimate Intellectual Exploration  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [January 25, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UltpI_b5iU)
*  Welcome to this installment of Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today the guest is Mark Miller, who is one of the most extraordinary food minds of our
*  generation.
*  It's hard to even summarize what Mark has done.
*  I think of Mark as the modern founder of Southwestern cuisine.
*  He's well known for having been the driving force behind opening Coyote Cafe, which transformed
*  the Santa Fe dining scene, and Washington, D.C., where we are now in the Panda Gourmet
*  Restaurant.
*  Well, Mark is best known for Red Sage, a Southwestern restaurant that was one of D.C.'s best for
*  a long time.
*  Mark has written numerous books on food, on salsas, on chili.
*  He has the very best book on tacos.
*  If you've ever seen a famous poster of all those chilis, the chilis poster, well, Mark
*  did that.
*  Mark's been connected with a lot of restaurants.
*  He originally studied anthropology at Berkeley, and I think of Mark's contribution as synthesizing
*  anthropology, cooking, studying food through books, studying food through practice.
*  He's lived in 20 countries, traveled in over 100, and he understands taste and sensation
*  and context of food, its anthropological setting, combined with all this fantastic real world
*  experience.
*  And on top of all that, Mark has been a food consultant for more companies than I can name.
*  That's just my very brief introduction to Mark, and it doesn't begin to do him justice.
*  We'll start the conversation in a moment.
*  As our questioner for today's segment, we also have with us Megan McCardle of Bloomberg
*  View.
*  Megan is a longstanding friend of mine.
*  In addition to her writing on politics and economics, Megan was arguably the first, very
*  first economics blogger, and she is deeply involved in the food world.
*  Megan, to me, each year writes the single best guide to kitchen equipment, what is new
*  out each year.
*  Anyway, we'll start by chatting with Mark, and then Megan will come in with some questions.
*  So food worlds.
*  I'm very interested in how you think about food worlds, and this contrast between the
*  food worlds of China, Japan, Tokyo, and South Korea.
*  You told me you thought Saul had the most interesting and creative food world of those
*  three, and tell us why you think that.
*  I've been traveling to all three countries for approximately 40 years or more, so I've
*  really seen them transform themselves, and I've also seen how they adapt and how they
*  acculturate other international influences.
*  So I've been going to Japan since I was a student at Berkeley, since 1969 was my first
*  trip.
*  I've been going to China since the 70s.
*  Saul is the one that I know the least, but I've been following it for about 15 years.
*  Recently, in May, I went to the Big Saul Food Show, where I actually ate 100 food products
*  I had never had before, which is interesting.
*  But the other thing that happened was, I realized that Saul had moved in terms of its transformation
*  of plasticity and creativity.
*  There's a restaurant called Mingles that every single dish was incorporating Korean ingredients,
*  but in a very creative, modern way.
*  And they were not afraid to move their food outside of the traditional vortex of what
*  was seen as Korean food, and they were using Korean ingredients in a new way that was authenticating
*  a cuisine.
*  Now in Japan, for instance, and they were doing pizza, they were doing coffee, they
*  were doing very good pizza that's almost as good as you'd find, for instance, in Italy.
*  In Japan, when you go to eat pizza, whether it's Neapolitan, either in Tokyo or Kyoto,
*  you find that they get to a certain level of the form of it, but the flavor and the gestalt and the aesthetic,
*  they can't quite get at it.
*  They remain Japanese.
*  The homogeneity of Japanese culture is its strength, it's also its weakness.
*  In China, maybe I've been going there and I've seen some data of one of the big companies
*  that had 7,000 restaurants, we're seeing that they're using the Western restaurants in order
*  to create a sense of modernity and identity.
*  Whether they'll really use it for their own personal things right now, there is no other
*  alternative.
*  That social space that's open from children through going out, through celebrations and
*  weddings and the Western brands are the markers for special.
*  So Korea though, I was surprised that first of all they've moved so quickly.
*  The last time I was there was four and a half years ago.
*  I would have thought to get to this level would have taken them 20 years.
*  Plus the level of Italian, coffee, pizza, modern Korean, French was all exactly where
*  we would be in the United States.
*  We'll get to Japan and China, but more in Korea.
*  The alley food in Seoul and the rest of Korea seems so good to me.
*  So if I walk down a back alley, there will be 20 different places I want to eat.
*  Most of them will be outstanding.
*  It might for instance be some of the best fried chicken in the world.
*  I would agree.
*  But what's the structure of the food world in Seoul and other parts of South Korea that
*  have given rise to that?
*  Well, I think that what has happened, it's sort of like Samsung versus Sony.
*  If you actually look at those technological giants, which one has been able to maintain
*  and innovate.
*  And for some reason, you know, Sony lost its way.
*  We remember when Sony was the innovative center of electronics.
*  And yet today, it's Samsung.
*  I mean, not given not the last one that came out.
*  But basically, I think the Koreans are forced out of their comfort zone because they have
*  North Korea on their border.
*  They have China to compete with being aggressive and they have the finesse of Japan.
*  So their context of competition just in their own backyard is such that it makes them that
*  they can't be in there.
*  Japan is staying alone.
*  It's in its own comfort zone.
*  It's going to stay there.
*  China wants to move and be global, but it's a big stretch.
*  So you think Japan in a way has painted itself into a corner of perfection.
*  You can have very, very good French food in Tokyo, arguably better than Paris.
*  It won't ever be getting any better.
*  But it'll be the same French food that I would have eaten in Paris in 1980.
*  Or you can have a quite good Mexican mole in Tokyo, I found.
*  Or Singapore laksa you can have in Tokyo.
*  And the person who makes it might have studied in Singapore for five or six years.
*  They'll come back with the perfected recipe, but there's no other connection to that food
*  world.
*  In Mexico, if we look at, for instance, part of Mexican food like when Enrique Cosme in
*  New York is embracing modern Mexican and yet doesn't want to learn ancient traditional
*  Mexican.
*  And yet it's moving beyond its roots and it's becoming Mexican, whereas Mexico before was
*  trapped in looking at Spain, looking at the US, and looking at other identity systems
*  to validate its own food supply.
*  Give a good example.
*  Mezcal, my good friend, Ron Cooper, was out of Delmague.
*  That's a company 20 years ago that Mexicans would not drink mezcal because it was associated
*  with peasant Mexican.
*  And today, when you go to Mexico City, the only thing you can drink is mezcal because
*  people want to be Mexican.
*  And it's trendy even in Washington, DC.
*  And chocho in Korea.
*  So the problem was Korea was always in Japan's shadow.
*  And they were basically beaten down and defensive.
*  And I think right now they're not.
*  So we just had a dialogue with Fuchsia Dunlop, who's written on Chinese cooking.
*  The food world in China now, how do you see it?
*  Is it getting better, getting worse?
*  Is it headed to become large corporations as in America making a lot of soulless food?
*  Or is it still on the way up?
*  That's a difficult question because restaurants that I know in Fuchsia now, like Jesse, which
*  is an old restaurant in Shanghai, I was there recently and I've been going to that same
*  restaurant for 20 years from when it had four tables by one family.
*  Now they have multiple, but still.
*  What Fuchsia talked about though is going to stop them is the level of status of someone
*  joining a cooking profession.
*  In Tai Fong, the dumplings have gone down.
*  So what's happening now is even though they have this great tradition of cooking, the
*  workforce is either coming straight from the countryside without being trained.
*  The restaurants are making a lot of money because the people who are going there don't
*  have trained palates.
*  And so they just open up and be better.
*  So a traditional restaurant that takes a lot of training and to go into that, you're
*  not going to find the workforce.
*  So I think that they're going to go through a period right now of probably, I would call,
*  mediocrity.
*  But doesn't the low status of cooking in China in some ways protect them?
*  So it keeps pretensions out of the food world.
*  It means people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds can become cooks.
*  You can have a grandmother or a grandfather being a cook.
*  You can walk along in Shanghai and find a place where they make dumplings and they simply
*  roll them.
*  And no one there thinks of what they're doing as an art.
*  But that ultimately enables free entry and gives people a bit of the freedom that they
*  don't have in Tokyo.
*  And thus, I would say you should be more optimistic about food in China.
*  The dumplings that I used to see on the street stone, again, I've been going to Shanghai
*  since the 70s, late 70s.
*  They were all over the place.
*  Now they're very hard to find.
*  The Chinese government is afraid of basically health reasons, is now controlling where food
*  is basically exhibited and where food can be bought and sold.
*  And so a lot of the shops have moved into some of the department stores, for instance,
*  and are there.
*  But there used to be one amazing bao made out of smoked tofu and bitter greens and mustard.
*  And I would just wait for my next trip to Shanghai.
*  And for 15 years, I would go to the same place.
*  It was in the French Quarter, same corner, and they had the best bao.
*  And it's gone.
*  And I looked all over, and I can't even find that bao.
*  Or I can't find a noodle where I used to put out my hand with coins, and people would say,
*  they didn't have money then.
*  And I used to go to the wet markets and just look at what other people were eating.
*  And the last time I could do that was like maybe 15 years ago.
*  I haven't seen a noodle, like a hundred noodle stands.
*  In Mexico, you can still see it.
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  But even there, street food is being pushed out of Mexico City somewhat.
*  But you go to a bus station in Monterey, and you can see the most best tacos in the world.
*  And we will get to that.
*  But let's see.
*  Anyway.
*  For Asia, for now still.
*  Let's say someone comes to you.
*  Mark Miller.
*  You've been to over 100 countries, eaten in them for decades.
*  They say, I have two weeks to do a food tour in Asia.
*  You should pick for me three cities.
*  What are your selections?
*  I would pick...
*  I know I would pick Chong...
*  Well, no.
*  I would pick Seoul for sure.
*  Okay, Seoul.
*  You've covered.
*  I would probably pick Bangkok.
*  And a toss up between...
*  And I would pick Tokyo.
*  And you would pick Tokyo.
*  Yeah.
*  So Bangkok.
*  Say someone's in Bangkok.
*  They don't speak Thai.
*  They're puzzled.
*  They don't know what they're doing.
*  They don't have a Thai friend.
*  Conceptually, how should they think about finding the best food in Bangkok?
*  Go to the night markets.
*  The food on the street is just amazing.
*  It's probably the best in the world on the street.
*  It has the most variety.
*  It's the freshest.
*  The Thai people also are very clean.
*  I've never been sick once.
*  I've been eating food on the street forever.
*  The largest market in the world has 15,000 booths.
*  Probably you can just spend four hours and eat 100 dishes.
*  My record in Bangkok one day is 14 restaurants and 75 dishes.
*  And I actually ate them all, not tasted them.
*  So just get a hotel...
*  And probably spent less than we'd spent in Washington one night.
*  Get a hotel in that part of Bangkok and just go eat there.
*  Yeah, I would go...
*  There are some good books.
*  There's a street hawker guide.
*  There's some good bloggers who are out there.
*  But I would not be afraid.
*  And the thing is, is always with street food is always go...
*  So the night food is the night food.
*  The day food is the day food.
*  But even some of that has moved into malls where the Thai people go.
*  And they'll do a som tam for 50 cents or a dollar and a half.
*  And you might see a thousand people.
*  If a thousand Thai people are eating there, it's safe to eat there.
*  But I have a bias against malls when it comes to Southeast Asian food.
*  I tend to think malls are worse than street food.
*  No, but in Kaila Lumpur, they went through the entire country and they picked the best
*  street food and put it into the mall so that people could experience the best of the entire
*  country in one place.
*  That's the reason that people go to the hotel.
*  And also when you go in Singapore, the Hyatt and Hess streets, they're actually...
*  They have 27 chefs, each from different parts of Singapore, running each station within
*  that one dining room.
*  Malaysia or Singapore, which has better food?
*  Well they're very close.
*  I would say Penang is really interesting.
*  I would say right now though, Singapore, like Korea, is finally getting out of its straight
*  jacket.
*  There are some really modern young Korean chefs that are incorporating Southeast Asian...
*  Singaporean chefs you mean?
*  Singaporean chefs.
*  They know Chinese food, they have access to the best ingredients, they know Western food,
*  and they have their own tradition from Malaysian to the original...
*  Help me there, the straight cuisine.
*  The Peranakan cuisine.
*  Peranakan cuisine, which is...
*  I always think that those cuisines that are older and...
*  If they have great weavings, they have great cuisine because I always say, you're looking
*  at one mentality.
*  If they had a rich aesthetic tradition, I know that they had really interesting food.
*  So take Indonesia, they have great weavings in Indonesia.
*  I lived in Ubud in 1970.
*  But I'm often disappointed by street food in Indonesia.
*  It seems just the quality standards, a bit like the Philippines.
*  Yeah, but the great dishes like Balinese duck that has 28 ingredients in it, it's amazing.
*  It's amazing dishes.
*  It's hard to...
*  Those temple foods, those festival foods, I remember three days at the Feast of the
*  Temple...
*  The Feast of the Coconut Goddess, there were 127 dishes made in those three days.
*  Let me ask you some questions about chilies.
*  Those are...
*  No, but the variety and richness, and we come back here to the United States and you have
*  a hamburger and a hot dog.
*  Let me ask you some questions about chilies, the area where you've probably had the greatest
*  impact of all food areas.
*  So here I have some mulatto chilies.
*  If you look at a lot of food recipes, if you make a Mexican mole, you will use more mulattoes
*  than any other kind of chile.
*  Not always, but quite typically, say in the Rick Bayless recipe.
*  Yeah.
*  Why is that?
*  What is it about this chili?
*  Well, first of all, you have to...
*  Do what you want.
*  You've got to open...
*  First of all, you have to open them up because 90% of all chilies are mislabeled.
*  That's one of the problems.
*  So that you may...
*  Whatever it says on the package may or may not be true.
*  The point is, is that mulattoes, when you hold them up to the light, like this, see
*  it's more...
*  Do you see it's more purple and more reddish?
*  Yes, I do.
*  Or cordovan.
*  That is not a mulatto.
*  So they defrauded me.
*  Yeah, that's an ancho.
*  Okay.
*  Because a mulatto will be more coffee-ish and more dark tones.
*  What a mulatto will do is actually have those flavonoids that are coffee and chocolate.
*  And those in a mole are the undertones of the wide sort of structure, the wide foundation
*  of those flavors that we really like.
*  Now the fruit tones and the capsaicin, so the spicy tones, are your basically accessories.
*  The ancho is always the workhorse because it carries the most fruit.
*  The mulatto carries the coffee and chocolate, which is those more or less fermented, umami,
*  more complex sort of flavonoids.
*  And then we throw in some guajillos or arbols to brighten it all up and get it going.
*  So if I make a Mexican mole with these fraudulent mulatto chilies, what exactly will go wrong?
*  You're a super taster.
*  You can tell the difference.
*  What will be missing?
*  Well, the thing is that, can I, I'm going to taste this for a second.
*  We can all taste together.
*  First of all, whenever you taste the chili, you notice there's a vein here.
*  You want to stay away from the veins always.
*  They contain 60% of the capsaicin.
*  So you always stay away from the veins and even if you can't see them.
*  The other thing is, this is old, you know, and this is what's called a grade C chili.
*  Yes.
*  It's small and it's dried and it's last year's crop.
*  So they lose their perfume.
*  They're like flowers.
*  They lose.
*  So you, what you end up is you end up with the capsaicin.
*  So this is a little bit bitter.
*  Do you notice?
*  Correct.
*  Like bitter tea, a little bit like lap sang chuchong.
*  There's a little bit of that smoky, woody, mushroomy flavor.
*  Where's my coffee and chocolate?
*  Where is it?
*  It's not here.
*  So if you use this in your recipe, you'll say it didn't come out well.
*  You know what you didn't do?
*  You didn't taste your ingredients.
*  So you're not going to get that wonderful warm flavor that mulatto is supposed to have.
*  And if I want a real mulatto chili, how do I actually get one?
*  Even that 90% of it, according to you, is fraud.
*  Or at least misleading or someone made a mistake.
*  You need to recognize when just the plus.
*  Okay, the other thing, when you buy chilies, the thickness of the flesh is the most important
*  thing.
*  So all fruits, where do the tannins come from?
*  Skins, seeds, and stems.
*  So the thicker the flesh, the least percentage of tannin.
*  And that's what Mexicans do.
*  They look for the most pliable.
*  They look how thick it is.
*  And when you hold it up to the light, they can tell how ripe it was before it was dried,
*  how much fruit flavor is going to be there.
*  Those are the big premieres.
*  So when you're using a mole, you're really reincorporating fresh fruit complex tones
*  into it.
*  The chilies, the last thing they're looking for is heat.
*  That's the last thing they're looking for.
*  Now, two other chilies.
*  And also, you notice it's still bitter on the palate.
*  And it tastes a little bit like the fruit leather that's kind of stale.
*  This one claims to be an ancho, but we're happy to hear your revisionist take on it.
*  This is bigger, for one.
*  It's bigger.
*  Yeah, and it's a little bit darker.
*  It's got that really dark, dark, dark, almost blackish-brown look.
*  You need to hold them up to the light, because that tells you.
*  So that's red, like an ancho.
*  It's pretty even inside.
*  There's no mold.
*  If you get one moldy chili out of 40, it'll ruin the mole.
*  A lot of people don't look for them.
*  And when you rehydrate them, you taste the one.
*  So this one, the leather again, should taste like a fruit leather.
*  Don't think chilies.
*  See, what we're talking about with fuchsia, the paradigm and what you have in your head
*  when you go after the taste is what you will taste.
*  If you think chilies can go for heat, you need to think fruit leather.
*  Which fruit do you get?
*  Tell me the fruits you get.
*  What spice do you not?
*  Which fruits?
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  Is it cherry, apple, blackberry, blueberry?
*  It's like a maybe apple, maybe cherry.
*  Not blueberry, not blackberry.
*  No, but it's definitely like cherry.
*  It's actually black cherry or sour cherry.
*  And it has little bits of what it is in this.
*  And there is this blackberry current cassis almost, like the French cassis flavor at the
*  bottom.
*  The point is that when you work with ingredients, I don't care if it's chili, coriander.
*  I have four different coriander, from Indian to this, or cumin.
*  When you cook an ethnic food, a poor chef, and I work in Guelma, what they're doing is
*  they're controlling their palate.
*  It may look like those ingredients are not important, they're not expensive, but they're
*  very, very important.
*  And that's why, this is not a bad intro.
*  I would say B plus.
*  And here's supposedly a pasilla.
*  Tell us the difference.
*  Well, this is, it should be pasilla and anger, it should be longer for one thing.
*  And it should be really get those black currant, black fruits, blackberry.
*  When you, again, think black fruits.
*  Is this just an ancho?
*  Have I brought you three packages of anchos, actually?
*  Maybe.
*  Yeah, that's what it is.
*  That's what it is.
*  Ancho everywhere.
*  A little thicker.
*  They are really wide then.
*  Yeah.
*  A little bit.
*  This was, the second one was the best one.
*  Second one was the best one.
*  Most fruit, most fruit tones, freshest, and less tannic.
*  But you don't want like a bitter wine or a bitter, you don't want tannins.
*  And what's your economic theory of why these different chilies get mixed up and they're
*  all anchos?
*  More like, notice the amount of liquors though.
*  The amount of black liquors in this one.
*  The reason is, is that the wholesalers basically, part of it is they're run a lot of times by
*  non-Mexicans.
*  Even if they're run by Mexicans, they only know the chilies that they grow up in their
*  region.
*  Like I'm teaching in a seminar in Mexico City at the end of the month.
*  Yes.
*  And they literally take out chilies and hand them to Mexicans that don't know what they
*  are even though they're from another area of Mexico.
*  How many different kinds of chilies do you know?
*  I once had a collection of about 250 in my garage.
*  But they're not, some of them are the same.
*  Like Arbol's, interesting story.
*  So I was traveling around Bhutan.
*  Yes.
*  And I was going from town to town.
*  I had the chili book, this book with me.
*  Yes.
*  And there's this myth in Bhutan that chilies come from Bhutan.
*  The chili book, there it is.
*  And so I would show them that they're not from Bhutan and what they are.
*  And I started tasting them.
*  Then the next village I would go in, everybody was waiting for me.
*  All the kids and the chefs.
*  They would say, can I see the chili book?
*  Are there really chilies outside of Bhutan?
*  Are there chilies in the rest of the world?
*  Can you tell us about chilies?
*  And every town I went to it was the same thing.
*  But here a whole culture grows up with this history that they actually have had chilies.
*  Of course the Portuguese brought them into Thailand and then they migrated through the
*  trade routes into Bhutan.
*  And that's how they got there.
*  And they're only the cayenne varieties.
*  They're only the arbols and so forth.
*  They don't have any of these chilies.
*  Even if you grow these chilies, for instance, let's say you grow these chilies in Washington,
*  D.C., it won't have the right flavor because it won't have the right ultraviolet, which
*  has to be grown in the mountains, above 4,000 or 5,000 feet.
*  And it doesn't have an alkaline volcanic soil.
*  That needs to be in the central valley of Mexico, makes the best anchos and pasillas
*  in the world.
*  And when you go to the market, San Luis, that one village in that one place makes the best
*  particular.
*  In what state is that?
*  In the state of Mexico.
*  State of Mexico.
*  Yeah.
*  It's amazing though that they know their chilies.
*  Now there's a debate in Mexico right now.
*  You probably know about this, that China is exporting cheaper chilies to Mexico.
*  They are.
*  But some of the Mexicans don't like this.
*  How will that play itself out?
*  What's going to happen?
*  They don't have the flavor profile.
*  Part of it is they basically are undercutting the market.
*  So you see them in Oaxaca.
*  There are anchos there.
*  I can tell.
*  They're very bitter.
*  They're very alkaline-ish.
*  They don't have a good flavor.
*  But people are buying them because of economic necessity or that they don't really know the
*  difference.
*  But when I work in Sweden with spice companies, I'm not allowed to buy Mexican chilies, which
*  really offends me, because of the micro levels of bacteria that are on them and they're not
*  radiated.
*  So we can only use, in Europe, for instance, radiated things.
*  They have to come from Peru.
*  We don't buy them from Chile, but we buy them from Peru.
*  But all my sauces, I then have to adapt because I don't get great anchos or great malados.
*  But you can adapt.
*  Now, here's a jalapeno pepper, very popular in the United States.
*  I can even go into a giant or Safeway supermarket, and they will have these.
*  They seem to my untutored palate to at least be serviceable.
*  Why is the jalapeno so popular in the United States?
*  It's probably because basically it's the Chile of northern Mexico, where most of the
*  migrants' workers come from.
*  And it was part of the Tex-Mex tradition.
*  It's very simple.
*  You can use it fresh mostly, just right away.
*  It doesn't require, you can cut it up, use it in salsa frescos.
*  You can put it in a blender.
*  You can cook it in eggs.
*  It's a very Chilean.
*  It has, for me, a lot of flavor that is more akin to the green bell pepper with heat.
*  I prefer poblanos, which I think are richer.
*  And the poblanos, you know, is the predecessor.
*  We have one right here, yes.
*  The poblano, and this is actually where the bell pepper is, you know, well, it's a Chilean
*  yucatan, but this has much more depth.
*  It doesn't taste like green pepper.
*  It's not gaseous.
*  And it has what I call real green chili flavor.
*  There's only two in the world that have New Mexico, the true green chili, grown at high
*  altitudes.
*  If you grow it at low altitudes, it's the Anaheim.
*  This one, again, grows in Mexico.
*  Roasted, I think it's supreme.
*  Now, interesting, no one else...
*  This is one of my favorites.
*  No, in China, they don't use it.
*  They don't grow it.
*  And even when I see it in the markets in China, I went through China with a chef once, and
*  we bought the chilies and we would roast them and actually put them into China.
*  We took over the restaurant because I got tired of eating the food that they were...
*  So we were actually near Kashgar or something.
*  And they couldn't believe of the flavor of a roasted chili that was cleaned without washing
*  and then strips of it put in a stir-fried lamb dish and how actually good it was.
*  Here's a habanero, splendid orange color.
*  What's this good for?
*  Nothing?
*  Isn't it too hot?
*  Well, it's big, which bemoans me that it might not be the right one.
*  So well, it's got good smell.
*  So okay, the habanero is in the Shinaise family, the tropical family.
*  You want to use it for its tropical tone.
*  So what you do is you open it carefully.
*  The capsaicin hits your nose here.
*  You don't actually have to touch it.
*  You can feel it right there.
*  You should know the heat of everyone.
*  Go easily across the nose.
*  Now here though, you get a wonderful orange mango papaya scent.
*  Now this roasted and with the seeds and the veins taken out, reducing the heat by 60%,
*  it's still going to be hot because I have 20% left in the flesh, is going to actually
*  round out and pull up all that beautiful tropical aromatic.
*  And that will make that pineapple or salsa or jerk, that'll make it wonderful.
*  You smell the tropicalness.
*  Don't touch where it is.
*  You want to smell and think orange, mango, fruit, pineapple.
*  It's amazing.
*  What's the most underrated chili in the world?
*  Most underrated chili in the world.
*  I would probably say the poblano.
*  I can do a hundred dishes.
*  I can do a hundred salsas with this one chili.
*  How about from Peru, the yahi amarillo?
*  That might be one of my favorites.
*  Rucotos and yahi amarillo.
*  There you go.
*  And what makes them special?
*  Well, they don't have the depth and complexity.
*  They're more jungle-y.
*  Chilis don't like high nighttime temperatures.
*  They like cool nighttime temperatures.
*  The ricotto, when you have a terradito though, I mean, you've got to be in ceviche heaven
*  when you were just down in Lima and I go there all the time.
*  Those chilis though, when you make dried sauces out of them, they don't have a marriage of
*  complexity like the Mexicans.
*  The Mexicans, kind of like when you're in Bali and you're looking at a weaving from
*  1900 that's a triple e-cut, the complexity per not per this is just what Mexicans attain
*  with their sauces.
*  The pre-Columbian Peruvians have every single method of weaving and yet the Mexicans, the
*  reason I'm attracted so much to Mexican food is that they literally have probably the most
*  complex uses of spices and chilis in the world.
*  No question.
*  Nobody.
*  In Mexico, where's the best region to eat?
*  I would still say the three regions.
*  I like Puebla.
*  Yes.
*  I think Puebla is underrated.
*  I like the mole verdes in the morning and the mole amarillos of the seven moles.
*  The mole amarillos there is better than Oaxaca.
*  People talk about Oaxaca.
*  Oaxaca is good but not in the city of Oaxaca.
*  It's a little overrated now.
*  You have to get outside.
*  The place that has the Pesilla de Oaxaca, the great smoked chili, the best smoked chili
*  in the world, smoked for three days with seven different hardwoods, requires nine hours in
*  a Land Rover to get to that village.
*  So that chili is being still made by one village in the entire world.
*  Nobody makes it.
*  They won't show it to anybody.
*  Even Diana Kennedy has not seen it.
*  We've all been to the village.
*  So you still have products today in Mexico that are actually not only the world class,
*  they don't exist anywhere else in the world.
*  And the Chinese could never duplicate it.
*  Never.
*  So let's say you can pick not a city but one village in Mexico.
*  And I'm going to send you there for a week and all you can do is eat.
*  Which village do you pick?
*  Um, I'll make that into a two-way seat.
*  Hmm.
*  In the old days, I would have said Merida, but not anymore.
*  I would still say, I like Puebla today.
*  Near Puebla.
*  Puebla, yeah, that area.
*  And you take on pre-Hispanic Mexican cuisine.
*  So it has a lot of insects.
*  It has fried worms.
*  It has mosquito larvae.
*  And those were, as you know, they cleaned the canals.
*  They actually got rid of the diseases that way.
*  The most interesting thing though, you know what it's about?
*  Is we actually went to the museum and looked at the pre-Columbian matates that were done
*  for the nixtamal.
*  Yes.
*  And guess what?
*  What?
*  They were never washed.
*  They were never washed.
*  Why is that?
*  So they all, when you nixtamal corn, it becomes more nutritional because you free up all
*  the amino acids.
*  Yes.
*  So the Italians have polenta, they got pellegra.
*  Yes.
*  So, but what happens is people talk about how fat Mexicans are or how pre-diabetic.
*  The reason is, is that they are using a post-industrial diet that wasn't, probiotics were put back
*  in.
*  So traditionally the matates were never washed.
*  They had levels of probiotics in there that were put back in.
*  And the women, for the texture inside the tortillas, would use wild grasses that actually
*  contain the largest amount of wild yeast.
*  So the reason you look previous to 1925 in Mexico, there's no diabetes, is the probiotic
*  and digestibility.
*  One of the reasons is of the masa itself.
*  So let's say we send you back.
*  But also the flavor changes.
*  I was up in the mountains with the woman and I had the best tortilla I've ever had in my
*  life and I couldn't figure out why she was getting this flavor.
*  She had a 500 year old farm.
*  The reason was, what happens when you use probiotics in yogurt and ice cream?
*  You change the flavonoids.
*  So essentially, not only was it about health, she was making a more complex flavor and interesting
*  dish.
*  So what I go to villages for is to study those perceptional patterns of how and why are they
*  getting more complex flavors.
*  They don't buy things on Amazon and go to the store or go to Whole Foods.
*  They are actually using their body as this window of opportunity to create complexity.
*  So I send you back to central Mexico in the middle of the 18th century.
*  A, how good is the food?
*  And B, how recognizable is it like?
*  1750, let's say.
*  How recognizable is it like, in your opinion, what we would get in the outskirts of Oaxaca
*  today or near Puebla or in Guerrero?
*  Well, it depends what class you are.
*  We'll say that you're in a ranch in northern Mexico.
*  You have enough money to buy what you want.
*  I would say it's probably very similar to what, except for the step for Maseca intervention
*  in 1925 after the revolution because the government wanted to control the food supply and that's
*  why tortillas are so cheap.
*  That was the same thing in France.
*  When you go to France today, why buy baguettes at the price they are.
*  But the food, in terms of the, what the Spanish brought was pigs.
*  They brought obviously pig, sheep, beef.
*  Unfortunately, it ruined the ecosystem of the pre-Columbians, which was not dependent
*  on rooting animals, the same thing they did in the Caribbean, as you know, for trade.
*  Europe could not grow its own food.
*  Europe, if you take Columbus leaving, 30% of the people were starving to death without
*  warfare.
*  In the end of the 1915 century, 50% of the people were dead.
*  In New York today, why can I not get good New Mexican green chili at a restaurant?
*  Can't they just put it on a plane and fly it over?
*  I would pay twice the price, but it's not good.
*  Why is this the case?
*  Well, maybe it's not roasted then, correctly.
*  Maybe they're using, you need a fire roaster.
*  It needs to be done within the same time that it's picked and it comes at the end of the
*  season in terms of the...
*  The best time is at the end of August.
*  Now, there is a chili that's even better, which is called the chile pesado, which is
*  the red chili.
*  This is from New Mexico?
*  Yeah.
*  When the green turns red, the ristras, right?
*  That chili, before it gets dried, is actually fire roasted and then peeled and then dried.
*  That chili is sublime.
*  It's called chile pesado.
*  Now, we're losing, even in New Mexico or Mexico, that tradition came up from Mexico.
*  It was north of Monterrey.
*  What I'm afraid of is we're beginning to lose the palette and those ingredients.
*  When you talk about a historical dish, what I always think is...
*  When we look at masa, which chef ever told you that you must put the probiotics back
*  into...
*  No one ever told me that.
*  A lot of chefs in New York are talking about organic corn, but they're not talking about
*  really resurrecting the complexity of the flavor of the native people.
*  You know why?
*  Because they don't go to the villages, they don't eat there, and they don't use their
*  brain to think about how are these people achieving that level of complexity.
*  They're not shopping for it.
*  What are some shoppers today?
*  Here's a piece of purple corn.
*  I bought it in the United States, but as you know, in Mexico, there are many colors of
*  corn.
*  It's vastly superior to even good corn we get in this country.
*  What's the future of corn?
*  Is the future of corn that the varieties from Mexico somehow will be replicated, spread,
*  evolved and innovated upon, or is the future of corn a kind of monoculture where most of
*  it is boring, a few strains of it taste good but are not really that interesting, and the
*  colors of corn in Mexico eventually disappear?
*  I did the corn posters after the Chile posters, and there are 8,862 varieties of corn.
*  You know all of them.
*  I don't know, but they're in the University of Seattle, in the G, whatever, the cryo.
*  The point is that I think that corn has a lot of ... North American Indians grew 400,
*  so corn, even in the United States, before the winter wheat, we always ate cornbread.
*  Corn was a big part of our culture, not just for ethanol.
*  I think because of what's happening in the United States about natural, I think that
*  once people put their palates and really queue them up and they can tell the difference in
*  varieties is when we're going to get much more varietal sort of differentiation in the
*  market.
*  If I give you six varieties of corn and I tell you to eat them and you can't tell the
*  difference, then you probably are unwilling to pay for them.
*  If I gave you six varieties of red wine, one is a Bordeaux from the first growth and one
*  is basically from Trader Joe's, and you can't tell the difference, well you probably don't.
*  But this happens that a lot of people can't tell the difference with wine, but we still
*  market the different strands.
*  Maybe people are fooled or it's a placebo effect.
*  But people are interested in change today and what's happening in that place and time.
*  Let's say that the 400 varieties of Native American corn come back to North America.
*  Let's say that you're in Portland.
*  There might be varieties that can only grow in Portland, only grow in Maine, only grow
*  in New Mexico.
*  The point is that corn, you will probably like, for instance the microbrew industry,
*  we talked about that in Portland.
*  If a community wants to engage its food culture on the community local level, it can be amazing.
*  Portland has 400 beers.
*  Why can't they have 30, 40 varieties of corn just in Portland?
*  It'll come.
*  There'll be a corn restaurant in Portland that'll say, you know what, we are not growing
*  the corn that everybody else has.
*  We do this and we have recipes from all these cultures that use corn from the Andes to Mexico
*  and we're going to open a corn restaurant based on corn that did grow.
*  One of my growers in New Mexico, when I first opened the restaurant in Santa Fe, can't grow
*  this, can't do this, can't do that, can't do anything.
*  Elizabeth Berry, my grower, grew 482 varieties of beans without electricity on land that
*  was essentially the Anasazi used to use in the fourth century.
*  These bean pots, do we actually know how many beans or the variety or what a diet was?
*  Native cultures, Frans Boas, we get into that, but he collected 254 salmon recipes.
*  A coqutile book would have been 3,000 recipes.
*  The average American housewife does 79 in her lifetime.
*  So who's richer?
*  We now move to the underrated versus overrated segment of the talk.
*  You're free to pass on any of these, but I'll just shoot out a few things.
*  You tell me if you think they're underrated or overrated.
*  The Michelin dining guide.
*  Overrated now.
*  Why?
*  It's too status-orientated.
*  It's dated.
*  I bet you the average age of the inspector is over 30.
*  I don't trust anybody in a company if the mean age is over 35 anymore.
*  I think that they're out of touch.
*  I think they're replaying old themes.
*  I think the Michelin guide is about status, a reification of a belief system in a particular
*  food and culture system that was based on the aristocracy.
*  The fast food restaurant Chipotle.
*  They just got knocked today.
*  Their stock just went down.
*  They're closing their chop houses, which I knew they would.
*  They can't do that.
*  Chipotle had a good space.
*  It did a lot of education.
*  They developed Neiman Ranch, for instance.
*  The problem with every big food company, not just Chipotle, you have 2,000 restaurants.
*  You say you're cooking the food, but the food comes from two plants from a factory like
*  Minyat that does 200,000 pounds a day.
*  The public transparency, are you actually cooking the food or are you manufacturing
*  it?
*  I think every big food chain is probably going to face this gestalt of where if you're cooking,
*  you can't be a chain.
*  I think the era of big food companies is actually over.
*  A company like Starbucks used to develop, you would go into a town and you'd see Starbucks
*  and it was familiar and known.
*  Now all you have to do is like, oh, I'm in Columbus, Ohio.
*  Coffee, oh, this guy is doing Fair Trade, interesting Guatemala blend.
*  Oh, I'm going to go there.
*  That information is-
*  You don't need brands, right?
*  You don't need brands anymore.
*  The consumer used to have brands as guide and trust.
*  Today there are other ways of developing that.
*  We're in consumer level three.
*  This consumers are defining brands and how brands get used.
*  I think that the idea of brand is probably, you're an economist, it's dated.
*  I agree.
*  The idea of brands is in some ways on the way out.
*  You're a big lover of the culture of the American West.
*  There's a lot of movies about the old west.
*  The movie High Noon, overrated or underrated?
*  No, underrated still.
*  Gary Cooper is amazing.
*  I mean, I think that those are epics.
*  I think that that's our mythology.
*  Of America.
*  Of America.
*  And those are our heroes.
*  Those are our gods from Zeus, our gods from Olympus.
*  We need those.
*  We always need something like that to grow up with.
*  Otherwise we're left with whatever's on TV.
*  Maybe this is a loaded question, but Southwestern cuisine, now is it overrated or underrated?
*  It's not appreciated.
*  So it's underrated.
*  Why?
*  Because it's hard to get the right ingredients.
*  It was difficult.
*  It takes a lot of time.
*  Yeah, it was just too difficult and the chefs today are not interested.
*  You have to translate three great traditions.
*  For me to do modern Southwest, you have to know Mexican.
*  You have to know Native American.
*  And you have to know the history of the European influence on the Western traditions, things
*  like the cattle drive and those things.
*  You have to know all three traditions and all three ingredients.
*  I had to read 400 books just to write this book and it took a lifetime.
*  That's your Red Sage book.
*  Red Sage book.
*  But I think that even chefs in my own kitchens, for instance, even after 11 years, could still
*  not make some of the sauces after 11 years in the kitchen.
*  Some of the sauces have 30 to 40 ingredients and each ingredient each time has to be tasted
*  because an eggplant, when you're in Japan, why does it take 15 years to be a good tempura
*  chef?
*  Because that eggplant in June is tighter, has less water, is less bitter than the one
*  in August.
*  It has a different batter, a different temperature.
*  So that 20 courses will require that chef to make exactly over 75, 85 decisions for
*  each meal he does through each week of the year.
*  One sushi bar I go, he knows 1,900 varieties.
*  So if you're a good Southwest chef, I don't think, I don't, you have to know at least
*  40 or 50 chilies.
*  You have to know all your spices, your beans, your vegetables.
*  You have to know game.
*  You have to know drying and roasting.
*  Probably you need to have three or four or five hundred recipes under your belt.
*  What's the most underrated European cuisine?
*  I think, I think Hungary, I've been going to Budapest.
*  I think it's, I would say right now, Budapest is on fire.
*  I'm having great food, great wine.
*  I think it's amazing.
*  I love the peppers there too.
*  And they love the chilies.
*  Have you been to Kalashka, to the Chili Museum?
*  No, I have not.
*  It's amazing.
*  I think that, and they're doing amazing things.
*  And they, you know, I would say right now the, London is always exciting because it's
*  the most international, most open.
*  But I have had some great food.
*  I've had meals in Budapest for 40 euros that equal anything in Paris for 400.
*  And the most overrated cuisine in Europe right now?
*  Haute French cuisine.
*  Haute French cuisine.
*  Especially in the central part of Paris that's the more of the historically dated sort of
*  tried and true.
*  I think that even a good, finding good French bistro, I was in Paris, you know, is difficult.
*  I think that, I think that they're in an identity crisis.
*  I think that the French themselves are, again like the Japanese, they're trying to reinvent
*  themselves, but they don't want to let go.
*  And the younger chefs, the best we went to, which is the hottest restaurant, it's a Japanese
*  chef who's lived in Paris.
*  He's got this gastro-modern thing that's going on three months.
*  And he's only serving cocktails, no wine.
*  And I took some older French people and they just couldn't get it.
*  They thought that it was an abomination.
*  He had taken, he wasn't interested in French cuisine.
*  He was reinterpreting where French dining and authenticity is in 2016.
*  So the younger chefs are concerned with authenticity.
*  And the authenticity of that experience for their guests is more important than an authentic
*  technique and recipe.
*  Where in the world do diners have the most advanced, exploratory, best palate?
*  At the macro level, not for one particular thing.
*  U.S.
*  U.S.
*  Why do you say that?
*  Because they're just the most, they have the least hangups about identity systems with
*  food.
*  We used to be food morons, right?
*  No, we were food ignorant.
*  Food ignorant, okay.
*  That means you can't learn.
*  Okay.
*  I think we were, and then we were intimidated by, we were kind of colonized by the idea
*  of European culture and French food, Chinese food.
*  And we were, I came from French-Canadian and I was told, also as immigrant groups vie for
*  status and the power within a society, they generally refer to the third, so the Italians
*  didn't like the French, you know, I lived in Boston.
*  My grandmother, if she saw a piece of garlic, she would have disowned me.
*  You know, and I think if you're, but the point was, I think right now as a multicultural
*  society and the chefs are traveling, they're opening and what's happening in the media
*  is that they're, and because of the immigrant populations, people experience those levels.
*  And the younger immigrants, we're into our third generation, so Cassia for instance,
*  third generation Vietnamese in L.A.
*  We've got the big Red Up New York Times, I've been there a couple times.
*  You get other chefs who are extending their own traditions.
*  You know, you talk about Slanted Door, you talk about Cosmé in New York City.
*  What we're beginning to understand is what I have fought for my whole life is ethnic
*  food is as complex as any expensive French restaurant is.
*  Or often more so.
*  Now you teach classes in tasting appreciation, is that correct?
*  Palate coaching.
*  Palate coaching.
*  With companies generally.
*  And you try to teach the executives or the workers or who is taught?
*  We try to teach everybody.
*  Depends, most importantly, if a brand has to have a brand since, we won't get into
*  branding but let's say that I'm working with the culinary department.
*  Just the culinary department.
*  What we want to do is bring the marketing people in.
*  We want to bring the consumer research people in.
*  We want to bring in the culinary people because we want a lexicon of what are we describing?
*  What is the experience?
*  We're not creating a product, we're creating an experience.
*  What is the consensus for what we like and don't like and what's good?
*  So women.
*  Women have a different palate than men.
*  If I know that the objective consumer jerky, for instance, more women are eating jerky.
*  Women don't like to chew.
*  We know that.
*  The point is women also like more natural flavors, not as much dramatic flavors as men.
*  Once we know this fact and we bring everybody in and we create jerkies, we would go through
*  ... If we have, for instance, a hamburger.
*  Six layers in a hamburger is 36 possibilities of eating it.
*  So one of the things, like next time you eat a hamburger, just put it upside down.
*  Take your favorite hamburger from your favorite brand and put it upside down.
*  You'll see that it eats completely different.
*  All the fat receptors are now in a different mode.
*  It's almost like turning something to a mirror.
*  So the experience and expression of it is completely ... People don't think that food ... Everybody,
*  I watch people in a restaurant.
*  You know what they do?
*  They eat and they take a glass of beer or wine.
*  They're drowning it out.
*  What you do is you light up and set the stage, take the beer or wine first, and then use
*  the flavors.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, because ... But people have bad ... They have bad taste habits.
*  They're not trained to taste.
*  And what's another of a bad taste habit that a lot of Americans have that you could ...
*  No attention span.
*  No attention span.
*  No attention span.
*  So we make them put it in their mouth.
*  First of all, texture, temperature, movement, and flavor.
*  Which one is first and second always by the semi-automatic nervous system?
*  You have no control over it.
*  Tell us which ... Okay, first one is texture.
*  Anything you put in the mouth.
*  Second one is temperature.
*  So obviously, if it's crunchy and hard and hot, you're naturally not going to understand
*  the flavor.
*  Your brain is just going to activate.
*  It's the defense system.
*  Is it too hot?
*  What is it?
*  It's a foreign object in my body.
*  So yeah, I'm going to be really upset.
*  So the point is that if you get it ... That's why sushi is kind of interesting, because
*  sushi comes out of this acceptance in Japan of the body and scent and sensual.
*  And so it's a movement into projecting sensual ... I know we're getting off, but the sensual
*  space of how we use our body.
*  So Chihiro talked about crunch.
*  What's interesting to me would be about the psychology of why do we have that, because
*  they choose to do something and they choose to not do something else.
*  But anyway, if you put something 10 seconds in the middle, then chew, because you get
*  the retronasal.
*  There's two parts.
*  Smell first.
*  First of all, smell, like in a wine thing.
*  Get the right software in your head.
*  So is it a fruit or is it a hot dog?
*  Get the right ... Chew for a few seconds, then stop, and then the enzymatic response
*  is 10 to 15.
*  Some flavors take 30 minutes to develop on the palate completely, but I always take 10
*  seconds and then chart.
*  What I'm going to ask you, is it a fast flavor or a slow flavor?
*  So lemon is fast.
*  Pork fat is slow.
*  Is it long or short?
*  Okay, so for instance ... What do you mean long or short?
*  Okay, a glass of wine can be very long or it can be very short.
*  But raisins, we always start with raisins.
*  We take something that people know.
*  So is a raisin long or short?
*  Actually, it's long.
*  How many ... Then we go for ... So it's fairly slow.
*  It's fairly long.
*  And taste occurs over time and space.
*  Do not use cognitive systems for sensual perception.
*  What you're doing is vocabulary is symbolically compressed in order to be expedited in terms
*  of the way we communicate.
*  However, it does not communicate sensual.
*  Otherwise, we would have no paintings, poetry, or music.
*  Well, once you tell people not to use words, you have to activate other cognitive perceptual
*  systems.
*  So, no words.
*  No words.
*  Body temperature.
*  Body temperature.
*  Don't chew.
*  Minimum of 15 seconds.
*  And then, memory is important.
*  What I want you to do then is taste it the second time because what you will have missed
*  is that basically it's gone by.
*  You're going to fill in.
*  You know when you scan and you read?
*  Yes.
*  You can actually see, understand by scanning.
*  The brain scans known flavors.
*  It fills in complexity.
*  You taste it 200th of a second.
*  You have 2,500 taste buds.
*  Each one has 10,000 nerve endings.
*  Those 2 million perceptions per second, your brain is going to have to figure out where
*  to put them and how to categorize them.
*  Unless you have preset categories and scan really quickly, so memory, you've had it and
*  I let you do it the second time.
*  You will see that you can fill it in and you'll be able to get the richness, the complexity,
*  and the length of the flavor.
*  But by telling people taste occurs over time and space, just that sentence is the first
*  one I always start with.
*  You have to move into that perceptual way of thinking about taste.
*  It is not immediate.
*  It's not cognitive.
*  It's not electronic.
*  It's not oral.
*  It occurs in the enzymatic response of the body for breaking down the flavonoids.
*  It takes time.
*  What people don't give me is time.
*  They don't give you time.
*  They don't give me perceptual time.
*  How much does the culinary cutting edge depend on context?
*  Let's say we took a Mark Miller equivalent of 50 years ago and fed that person, not a
*  very young you, but someone your age now, 50 years ago, who knew the foods of that time,
*  fed that Mark Miller the culinary cutting edge of today.
*  How much would he be able to appreciate it?
*  A lot.
*  A lot.
*  A lot.
*  Yeah.
*  I think because the context of using the body and perceptual space remains the same.
*  I may have changed from Elenya, from shape and ease to Elenya to, you know, we're talking
*  about generations of restaurants.
*  I think that chefs or I think that what culinary art does is it moves our ability to move our
*  perceptional sense of exploring the world just as a weaving or a painting does.
*  And it creates other realities that we may not have actually realized that we're there,
*  but we're there.
*  When I talked about chilies, I was the first person.
*  Now why was I the first person to write a book that chilies had flavors?
*  They've been eating chilies for 5,000 years.
*  I went to Robert Mondavi, we did a seminar, and I proved to him that they were like grapes
*  and that when you blend chilies in a mole, it took as much art and complexity as a winemaker.
*  And he was actually shocked, but he said I was correct.
*  But he had never thought, but he had never tasted, right?
*  So don't go in with the wrong perceptional.
*  Don't think that chilies are hot, for instance.
*  Sometimes I wonder about this.
*  You're what, in my opinion, what is sometimes called a super taster.
*  You can taste fine gradations and different flavors and items.
*  A level beyond how much other people can.
*  Even people who might call themselves foodies, right?
*  You have some special sensory ability.
*  Well actually, the term, and you can read how we, super taster is about the number of
*  actual taste buds per centimeter on your palate.
*  And actually I am not biologically a super taster in terms of the number of receptors
*  that I have.
*  I don't think that Baron Bernsen, you know, who's one of the greatest art critics or,
*  or actually had extraordinary eyesight.
*  But you're maybe better than a super taster.
*  It's at the cognitive level rather than on your tongue.
*  What I try to do is, remember the book The Shallows came out.
*  I try to do deep tasting, like deep reading.
*  Are we looking for patterns that exist within the perceptional space that I wasn't looking
*  for before?
*  So all of taste is about part of its memory, part of its perception, part of its connecting
*  those complexities.
*  I would be also, interesting enough, I'm slightly handicapped because I have a little bit of
*  auditory processing disorder.
*  So what happens is when I was a child, all of the world around me was categorized into
*  taste.
*  I don't, I can hear fine, but it creates cognitive dissonance.
*  I can't drive the car.
*  The point was, because I learned that my brain can actually look at taste and actually make
*  the world around me sensible, that when I looked at a raisin, people said, what do you
*  mean that there's more flavors in a raisin?
*  I says, no, pay attention, listen, listen carefully.
*  If you ever listen to like a harpsichord, people can't, their attention span has to
*  be so precise that it's a difference of a fortieth of a second.
*  Now when you play another electronic music, you don't develop that skill set.
*  How many different flavors or kinds of soy sauce can you distinguish by taste?
*  I've done a panel of 40 at a time.
*  I think that I've done, I've had a kitchen home of up to 70 at a time.
*  And you can tell one from the other.
*  By saltiness, by sweetness.
*  They all have a characteristic profile of complexities of umami, as we might call it,
*  the flavor, dark rich tones.
*  If you put 10, if you put, if you put 15 cabernets in front, I mean, I can still tell
*  you can do that.
*  Anybody can do that.
*  So we generally don't think of shoyu or soy sauces as being that complex.
*  So when we taste it, we don't, when we have, if I tell you this is an $800 bottle of wine,
*  you turn on your complexity sort of perceptional scan.
*  But I tell you that this is a Mexican taco.
*  You don't turn it on.
*  You already prejudiced.
*  I do.
*  But yeah, you do.
*  You do.
*  So soy sauces to me or when you're in Japan, the pickle on the table will tell me within
*  20 miles of where you grew up and where you live.
*  And the shoyu at the sushi, each great sushi house, not sushi bars, actually blends their
*  own shoyu.
*  And I can tell not only whether you're from Edo, but what generation are you from?
*  The 30s, the 40s or the 50s of what generation did you actually grow up to actually believe
*  that that was the style of the shoyu?
*  And if you're in Kyoto, these people, Japan is really good that way because it is literally
*  those 40 regions are so maintaining that isolation that you learn the differences from going
*  from one to another.
*  I can go from, I can take a train of two hours in Japan and cover more culinary differences
*  than you can the United States.
*  Thank you for those wonderful remarks, Mark.
*  With that, I turn the questioning over to Megan McCardell of Bloomberg.
*  Well, it's a little weird being the only questioner.
*  Talk about why you talked about how women and men's palates are different.
*  How is their cooking different?
*  I mean, there is an editor I know now at Eater, was it Sivor then, who said that male cookery
*  was all sort of knives, guts, and fire.
*  Knives, spice, and fire, I think was how she put it.
*  And that often seems like a fair characterization to me.
*  My guy friends really want to load up the heat.
*  I remember having a guy tell me that the secret to really good cooking was just dump Cajun
*  seasoning all over everything.
*  How do women cook different?
*  Well, I mean, we're not going to get into developmental theory here.
*  No, no.
*  What are the characteristics?
*  I can tell you that the general broad strokes, women are essentially more concerned with
*  internal experiences.
*  They are more motivated to talk to someone at a dining room table, and a guy will look
*  at the television, and you get four guys, and the four women will talk to each other.
*  The point is that early on, there's a better internalization of the phenomenological world
*  inside the body.
*  So they actually begin to recognize those characteristics of things that are what I
*  would call body perceptionally.
*  So that tends to be a little bit more subtle.
*  It tends to be a little bit more in time.
*  And they don't like the transformative process as much as understanding the, I'm going out
*  of line, but they would prefer to accept the flavor personality as is and understand it,
*  rather than change it into something that I do.
*  So like Fuchsia said, if you took that carrot, that pork, that kidney, and just made it spicy,
*  that's what guys, they want to change it and transform it.
*  They want to create something new.
*  They want to actually not allow, if you allowed nature to take its course, then you wouldn't
*  be cooking.
*  You don't have the heat.
*  You're not transforming the spice.
*  And so we're women, except for Lydia Shire in Boston, she's the only one that I could
*  never tell.
*  Women tend to actually believe that the ingredients should be left alone, Alice Waters,
*  or that school of cooking, and that you can literally coax natural ingredients into something
*  that's complex and satisfying and sophisticated and healthy.
*  And it's sustainable.
*  It's even better.
*  But man, I believe that if we go that too far, that we're not going to learn how to
*  make mole, that we're not concerned with other black bean soups.
*  I would rather learn how to make, when I lived in Guatemala, every woman in the village
*  made black bean soup.
*  Not one of those women ever told me, you know, I go to the market and buy organic black beans,
*  so mine's better.
*  Not every woman knew how good her black bean soup was.
*  The best woman in the village, she was 37 steps.
*  And she really got me going.
*  I traded to her We Appeal.
*  Now, women tend to be more focused and more creative and more subtle.
*  It doesn't mean that they're not as rich a tradition.
*  It just means that it's a different level of recognition.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  Mezcal or tequila?
*  Chichacapa by Del Magay is my favorite mezcal in the world.
*  And when it's tequilas, I still go for silvers, unless you represent in a margarita.
*  You should always use silvers, because they don't have any wood.
*  And if you're using fruit, whether it's a mango, strawberry, or anything else,
*  that idea of the gold coin or the upscale, that's just a marketing ploy
*  to make more money.
*  But it makes them more money, but it makes worse margaritas.
*  I mean, mezcal, though, was and is a native tradition built on extreme attention to nature.
*  And it's only wild agaves.
*  Each one of the palenques that Ron uses only can produce 400 cases a year.
*  And it's totally out of that village and that tradition.
*  And even though those 20 villages are within 100 miles,
*  they might as well be like two continents apart, because they express the whole world of...
*  You put five painters in Paris in 1900, and you get different paintings
*  in the same building in Montmartre, right?
*  Your favorite guilty pleasure bad food?
*  Oh, it's not a bad food.
*  It's ice cream.
*  Ice cream is God's gift to depression.
*  What flavor?
*  Any particular...
*  Oh, I like them all.
*  I happen to like cold.
*  I have a very sensitive palate, so I won't eat any hot soups or teas or things.
*  I always eat cold.
*  When I can get it, and that's preferable.
*  That would be my preference.
*  And if you had to say hot fudge sundae, how's that?
*  So I am someone who...
*  We talked about this a little earlier.
*  I have never been able to stand the taste of cooked fish,
*  and I have been trying because it's good for me and my husband loves fish.
*  But that fishy flavor makes me gag.
*  How would you advise someone like me?
*  Obviously, this is a broader question than just fish.
*  As someone who has something, I'm generally pretty willing to eat almost anything,
*  but you have that one thing or you have a couple things
*  where you're desperate to be able to tolerate it.
*  How do you go about learning?
*  Well, we talked earlier that I don't eat cooked fish at night
*  because the enzymes in your body change, and I only eat raw fish and churros.
*  But you actually may be the super taster because super...
*  No, super tasters tend to have...
*  And the problem with parents who don't realize the child,
*  they become very fixated and they like things that don't like things
*  because there's so powerful sensations for them.
*  Children in particular don't really know what to do with that category.
*  So if they had something that was green, that was very bitter,
*  that's why they won't eat green beans and won't...
*  They associate, then the entire category is something that they're going to be defensive of.
*  Your question about cooked fish would be,
*  have you ever tried like flame-broiled sashimi in a sushi grill?
*  Yeah, like a seared tuna, right? That's basically raw inside.
*  Yeah.
*  It just has... Yeah, I can totally eat that.
*  It's when it's like I cooked salmon or something.
*  No, but how far has it cooked? Do you know how many degrees?
*  No. I'm not daring enough to cook my own fish because I hate it.
*  Flavonoids develop and change over every two or three degrees.
*  That's why it's a misnomer. The more you cook meat, it's going to get...
*  No, the more livery it's going to get. Fish is exactly the same.
*  So what you want to do is get a piece of fish and find out...
*  130, I bet you the higher on the more objectionable flavonoids have not developed.
*  It's cooked. 135 is cooked. It'll go up five.
*  But I would just go home and do salmon and halibut.
*  I would start with halibut because it could be the oils.
*  It could be a combination of oils and flavonoids.
*  Or we could just make a really spicy fish when we go to Contra Mar
*  in Mexico City and just put red and green chili and throw it on the grill.
*  And I bet you would eat it. It would be wonderful.
*  The sous vide revolution. How do you feel about that?
*  Well, I've been working with it a long time. I worked with American Airlines in the 80s, 90s.
*  I worked with Cuisine Solutions. It is an amazing technique.
*  And it tends to be overused by chefs who believe that a perfect texture
*  is preferable to a more complex uneven.
*  Now the brain... Actually, it's wrong though.
*  Because the brain doesn't know what it is. It knows what it's not.
*  So teaching flavor is not teaching what that ingredient is.
*  It's teaching what it's not.
*  So if I have a sous vide piece of lamb and it's not crusted and it's not browned and there's no
*  my yard and then it's not... When you look at lamb and it has a rosé 50 percent,
*  it will start darker. It'll be more my yard. It'll be cooked.
*  What the brain then has four or five different perceptional zones to actually understand and
*  appreciate and differentiate. A sous vide piece of lamb that's pink all the way through with one
*  texture with no my yarding and no flavor of the lamb developed because it never went high enough
*  will actually won't be lamby enough and it'll taste like a lamb piece of bubblegum or a sponge.
*  Now I use interrupted sous vide. So I do a Chinese squab that I put an intensity.
*  I used to brine it for 48 hours with 14 spices, mainly cumin and chilies to get it all the way
*  through the squab, then roast it and then deep fry it like the Chinese. I found it by sous videing
*  it. They went in by 24 hours. So the fresh was squab was better. Then I cook it sous vide at a
*  different higher temperature even after it's in brine and then I fry it, deep fry it. So I find
*  that what I call interrupted sous vide as a technique which takes the... You get intensity
*  without preserving some freshness. So let's say that I did scallops and I do them sous vide. My
*  scallops are cooked for exactly 18 minutes and with a wine dinner I want to match the chamomile
*  in a sauvignon blanc. Well how do I do that? Actually I actually put in some fresh chamomile
*  with the scallops, cook it sous vide and the aromatic profile goes through. I made a little
*  to start. I do this and that and that sauvignon blanc with that is amazing. What is the biggest
*  mistake that people make when they go into a southwestern restaurant and sit down and order?
*  They want chips and soul so that's a big mistake. Why? So explain this. Well I mean it's a
*  phenomenon that they first of all they get it free. Second of all chips are usually done poorly
*  and then the salsa is usually done poorly. It's a good excuse to sit there and drink beers and
*  margaritas which is you know I don't need that excuse. But what you're looking for is something
*  that comes into let's say buffalo. We eat more buffalo. I was cooking buffalo. It was difficult
*  to sell back in the 70s and 80s. We know it's healthier. We know it has less cholesterol.
*  And the other thing is you want intense small portions of food. You don't want to you know so
*  when you're looking at a southwest menu you want to look for the sauces, the complexity.
*  You want to look for things that would probably take you that some things have been cured.
*  Like even red sage. What was the first thing that we did? We actually did a carpaccio of
*  venison. We had a tartar mixed of venison and buffalo with sage. We made you know that was on
*  the first menu at red sage in 1990. Now if you go around the United States 25 years later you
*  don't find that anymore. So if you were if someone came to you this is a game my family used to play
*  in the car. Someone comes to you and says I'm a fairy. You are only going to be allowed to eat
*  three foods for the rest of your life. Three dishes. Three specific dishes. So not like tacos
*  but a kind of taco. You don't have to worry about nutrition. You don't have to worry about
*  calories but you have to pick three foods and those are the only three foods you can ever have
*  again. Which three foods? Certainly lobster because I grew up in that part of the world,
*  Nova Scotia. Cooked in seaweed you know with butter, drawn butter you know. I would say you
*  know my short dinner which is lobster clams and you know they're all the one meal. They're not
*  three foods. Everyone always tries to like. Oysters, fried clams you know but lobster for sure.
*  I would say my second one would be yes. I would oh boy I would something spicy and I vie between
*  Thai and Mexican you know is my two favorite spicy cuisines in the world and I would
*  I would probably say a Mexican sort of you know amazing sort of taco with great salsas and the
*  right kind of you know tortilla. The third thing I might say would be surprisingly probably just
*  the chaleta de bue you know a five-year-old cow northern Spain roasted completely correctly
*  and the umami of each piece of meat is is better than any other meat that exists in the world.
*  Well there are better richer things in Japan but that part of northern Spain is just amazing.
*  What part of northern Spain is that? It's outside of Borgros. Okay. Yeah and it's extension of the
*  Basque area. Those are working cattle and you saw the film on you know the world world of steak I'm
*  sure and um and there's one that I like in in Barcelona which actually has does the espadrilles
*  out of out of the sea cucumbers too but I think that the honesty of French of Spanish food even
*  though I went to El Bolí many times about seven or eight times still remains uh cuisine that those
*  are those we talked about the ham that Fuchsia found we talked about ham in the dolomites. I
*  think that we we look culturally for our I think that we're always searching for those foods in
*  our environment that we give us pleasure that extend the body into that space and that elongate
*  our perceptional way of interacting with the world. So when someone talks about three-year-old tabugo
*  it's not that it's that expensive and it's that complex and that's interesting that it requires
*  so much of you to actually perceive it that you are more alive you are more there the ham is more
*  there that sense of presence is there and I think that's what great that's what a great chef can do
*  you can stimulate that sense of being there and we're losing that the virtual reality that's
*  happening we're losing our sense of being in presence. Korean tacos. Korean tacos I know Roy
*  so that's not fair I know Roy personally I think it's a good example of what Roy calls authentic
*  food he grew up in LA Roy Choi is Korean he is LA which has a lot of Mexican food and the sense
*  of combining his own interior reality into a projection on that plate to me is perfect
*  food what a chef should always be doing I'm not Mexican and the reason that I created Modern
*  Southwestern I think it would be a lie for me to do a Mexican restaurant Roberto Santa Benes
*  at Fonda was a good friend and a partner of mine a salsa company is Mexican from Mexico City and
*  does cook great Mexican food and I think that you you can learn but you should not co-opt an entire
*  culture or identity you you know I was at that I was a Chez Panisse and I didn't want to cook like
*  Alice Waters anymore so I was after you know it wasn't it's nothing wrong with Chez Panisse but
*  it wasn't my food and I was always arguing about it sometimes but the point is when a chef really
*  understands the world and ingredients and can bring that reality to his dining public that's an
*  amazing you know explosion of creativity and emotion and theater and it's wonderful right
*  if you had to sum up your food if you had to say if you had to in a couple of sentences say
*  this is what this is what my food was and why I needed to go do or is hopefully or is no no no
*  when I met when you left Chez Panisse this is what we all created the menus of Chez Panisse
*  it wasn't else but even then no I was there for a couple it's only because I might one of my
*  advisors didn't sign my thesis anyway I was supposed to be there for two weeks so I think
*  that my food is is a personal exploration of my own exploration of the world and I look at the
*  world through my senses mostly through taste sometimes smell I'm not a bad nose and what I'm
*  trying to do is understand not only the world we live in but sometimes past cultures I try to look
*  at pre-Columbian weavings I try to get a list of all the pre-Columbian foods and we see for instance
*  at Centrale which is a very famous restaurant Lima today that that complexity of these chunas and
*  this and things that grow were probably used and and stimulate the problem is do we actually have
*  the palette to actually go back wouldn't you like to live in I don't want to just see a Rembrandt
*  painting or I love the fifth I love it you know this I want to actually go back and eat the food
*  that he was eating in the markets and the cheeses and the things that were done because I want to
*  try to understand where that painting came from not only the psychology of the artist so when I
*  read a cookbook or I go to a restaurant I'm trying to understand the person or the place or the culture
*  fast food so you know the dark side well but can it be done well it is done well I mean fast food
*  is done well in Japan the places I go I eat udon I walk in it's being made by hand it costs two
*  dollars I decide what I'm going to put on top and I have a bowl and I've timed it it's 18 seconds
*  McDonald's it's a lifetime you know Starbucks Starbucks is 8.4 minutes that is too long takes
*  too long robot chefs I'm currently in the fast food but you know you've seen these machines now
*  that they're going to have that's going to like dice everything and it'll you know won't need any
*  human interaction at all what do you think of that probably would anybody notice
*  I really you know I think fast food I think that our model in the United States because of the real
*  estate and economics of it is completely wrong I think that a chef should open a restaurant at 10
*  seats I think he should charge 100 and I think he should make 150 and he should not pay rent or have
*  labor or have overhead or costs and what you should do is honor the tradition of respecting
*  the individual so in Japan they have this policy of not first customer there's a policy of not
*  taking you because they don't know how you're going to act they don't know who you are they
*  don't know you're also eating with you're not eating with you're eating with seven or eight
*  other people as an ensemble you're not completely separate so the idea of of re of
*  so the idea of of re-instituting cultural and social space and bonds and honoring the chef is
*  here and put something down there's no waitress there's no menu the point is is that that's the
*  reality of you and that's a personal connection it's like your mother the point whether it's that
*  point to me is that we have to go back to understanding that food is very part of our
*  psychological sense of space our body sense of space our pleasurable sense of space our own
*  cultural identity and if we let other people take over that by organic or this or labels or price
*  then what we've done is given that part of our lives up and I don't know that we're I'm just
*  saying this there's 300 noodle places in Kyoto nobody charges more than 10 or 12 dollars they're
*  all really good they're all a little bit different and guess who doesn't do well change the charge
*  10 for noodles that they have to pay high-end real estate like ishinoja there's two of them in
*  Kyoto I've been going to care for 50 years I've never been I'm never going to go there's no reason
*  to go chains only exist when the local community doesn't provide the same service so in a street
*  food market it's accessible so I can eat in Thailand a quail for 75 cents that same quail
*  in Washington DC or New York City will cost me like 18.95. Megan, Mark, thank you very much.
