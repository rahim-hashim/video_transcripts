# Conversations with Tyler 2024 Retrospective  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome to the 2024 Conversations with Tyler retrospective, where we look back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=0.0s)]
*  at past episodes, take listener questions, review Tyler's pop culture picks from 2014 [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=9.92s)]
*  in this case, and cover numerous other topics besides. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=16.02s)]
*  I'm Jeff Holmes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=20.36s)]
*  I'm one of the producers of Conversations with Tyler, and of course, I'm joined with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=21.36s)]
*  the man himself, Tyler. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=24.44s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=25.88s)]
*  Hello, Jeff. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=26.88s)]
*  Thank you for having me on the show. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=27.88s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=29.4s)]
*  So we did 30 episodes this year, Tyler. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  It's not a record, but you know, it's a pretty full slate when you look over this list of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=34.54s)]
*  episodes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=40.04s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=41.04s)]
*  Well, and there's the new podcast with Alex Tabarrok. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=42.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=44.32s)]
*  So it's a lot of episodes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=45.32s)]
*  I thought we had a very good year. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=46.32s)]
*  You know, each year you think, oh, it's not going to be that good this year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=48.32s)]
*  But this was very good. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=51.28s)]
*  Only a few weak episodes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  Yes, and we'll get into underrated episodes and most popular, but I'm glad you mentioned [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  the Marginal Revolution podcast. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  We just released the last episode of season one this morning that we're recording this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  Give the listeners a sense of season one of the Marginal Revolution podcast, what you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=69.84s)]
*  and Alex are hoping to do. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=74.0s)]
*  Why should they check it out? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  We had what, seven episodes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=77.2s)]
*  So it's all economics, unlike Conversations with Tyler. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=78.88s)]
*  On neither one of us interviews the other, we go back and forth. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=82.72s)]
*  And Alex and I have worked together now for about 35 years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  So we have a good sense of each other, good rapport. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=90.44s)]
*  And we just dive into economics. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  And a bit like Conversations with Tyler, we talk as we would talk to each other pretty [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=95.32s)]
*  much. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=100.28s)]
*  So it's like a window into actual conversations. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=101.28s)]
*  Yeah, for me, an alternate title of it was going to be GMU Lunch, because I think it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=104.36s)]
*  captures the spirit of you two, sometimes with a group of other professors, are just [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=110.0s)]
*  like-minded folks going out and having lunch and talking about. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=114.28s)]
*  There's more shrieking at lunch because you have Ryan Kaplan and Robin Hansen there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=117.48s)]
*  But it's like the calm version of GMU Lunch, the calm cooperative version. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=121.24s)]
*  And Alex on his post on the Options Pricing Theory episode today also asked people to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=125.76s)]
*  comment with ideas for season two. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=131.4s)]
*  So if you want to propose a topic for season two of the Marginal Revolution podcast, head [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=133.44s)]
*  over to the Marginal Revolution blog and find that post and leave a comment there. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=137.72s)]
*  And just to be clear, Conversations with Tyler will continue as it has been, and we hope [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=142.52s)]
*  to do even more episodes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  So no basic change in this product. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=148.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=152.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=153.16s)]
*  So returning to CWT, let's go over top episodes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=154.16s)]
*  So first, top by download. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  I know the answer you don't, but as you look over the 29 episodes, it's 30, including this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=159.88s)]
*  one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=166.68s)]
*  Which one do you think was our most downloaded episode this year? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=167.68s)]
*  And we're talking about just audio downloads. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=170.96s)]
*  We're not counting you two. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, to paraphrase Peter Thiel, I'll say never bet against Peter Thiel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=174.0s)]
*  He likes to say never bet against Elon Musk. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  So I think Peter typically is the most downloaded episode for many people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=180.8s)]
*  And that's my pick. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  And that bet pays off. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=186.84s)]
*  He is number one. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=188.36s)]
*  He broke the first day, first week listening records for the show. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Actually several people broke listening records, but he's on top. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=195.64s)]
*  John Hite would be my number two pick, which was contentious people of fights, arguments, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=200.48s)]
*  debate, different from a lot of the other episodes, hot topics. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=205.28s)]
*  John took that all in very good spirits. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=209.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=211.4s)]
*  Jonathan Hite is number two. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=212.4s)]
*  So you're two for two. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=213.4s)]
*  Do you want to try to round out the top five or maybe the top three? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=214.4s)]
*  I think they're pretty predictable through the top three. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=217.68s)]
*  I think I'm just guessing here, but Mark Andreessen is always a good pick to be a top [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=221.08s)]
*  download. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=226.68s)]
*  Am I right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=227.68s)]
*  You're wrong because keep in mind that was a panel audio of the A16Z event. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  So that's not a full on conversation with Tyler episode. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=235.8s)]
*  So he did not make the top five. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=240.24s)]
*  What would be another guess? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=242.24s)]
*  Kyla Scanlon? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  After that, it's hard for me to say. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  Nate Silver, I guess, would be my guess. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  Toby Lutka? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=250.36s)]
*  Nate Silver. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=251.36s)]
*  Nate Silver. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=252.36s)]
*  You threw out a couple of names. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=253.36s)]
*  You were answering a little bit, but I'm going to take Nate Silver. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=254.36s)]
*  That was number three. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  And then rounding out the top five, number four was Patrick McKenzie. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=257.32s)]
*  Number five was Paul Bloom. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=261.12s)]
*  So all of those are very close within maybe a thousand downloads of each other. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=263.72s)]
*  So we're pleasing people too much. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  Is that the lesson? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  I sent out an email to our newsletter about this and I think you have to say it's a little [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  predictable. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=279.16s)]
*  It gets maybe a little eclectic towards the end, but this was very much fan service, I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  think, these top five. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=285.56s)]
*  So it would be nice to see maybe a less well-known person cracking that top five, but something [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=288.26000000000005s)]
*  for us to aspire to next year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=295.32000000000005s)]
*  Moving on to underrated episodes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=299.24s)]
*  So episodes that weren't necessarily breaking download records, but are still very, very [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=301.32000000000005s)]
*  good. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  You could think of them as a personal favorite. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=308.36s)]
*  I've got my picks. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=310.88s)]
*  Do you want to throw out a couple? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=312.24s)]
*  Well, one underrated episode was Masaki Suzuki, because most people don't know enough about [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=313.56s)]
*  Bach to really love what he said. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=318.72s)]
*  Plus he had an accent that may hurt downloads a bit. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=320.6s)]
*  But that one I was very fond of. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=324.36s)]
*  Fareed Zakaria. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  You got to see the real Fareed. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=327.64s)]
*  Even his son loved the episode. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=330.12s)]
*  I don't know how many downloads it got, but it has to be underrated. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=331.56s)]
*  Michael Nielsen. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=335.56s)]
*  Most are underrated. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=338.72s)]
*  Tom Tugentot, who did not make it to be head of the Conservative Party, but someday still [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=339.72s)]
*  might and certainly ought to be. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=346.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=348.44s)]
*  Those are good picks. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=349.44s)]
*  Masaki Suzuki was a fan mention as well. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=351.48s)]
*  A favorite of my wife's. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=354.72s)]
*  So check that one out if you haven't. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=356.92s)]
*  I would also throw out Steven Kotkin. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=359.4s)]
*  So pretty recent episode. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=361.98s)]
*  Kotkin performed very well. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=363.68s)]
*  That's one of the best episodes of all time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=365.48s)]
*  But it clearly just established itself in the pantheon. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  You think about Lazarus Lake in the past or Richard Prum, which were some of my favorites. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  Just as soon as you listen to it, it's a clear favorite. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  If you check out the YouTube comments, many people are commenting that it's their favorite [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  Steven Kotkin interview. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=385.0s)]
*  People are still listening, so that will climb in the numbers. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=387.24s)]
*  And Paula Byrne was a tremendous episode. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  Paula Byrne was another pick of mine. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=391.88s)]
*  That one just released last week, but it's definitely tracking low. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=395.64s)]
*  And I would say, look, you've got Hardee's marriages, why they fell apart, couples counseling. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  What's not to love about listening to someone who does couples therapy? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=407.12s)]
*  And also the story of the poison pen letters and how she flushed out this maybe jealous [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=411.46s)]
*  academic who was harassing her via very cleverly written letters and mailing them to her and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=417.36s)]
*  other people. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=423.02s)]
*  It's the funniest CWT episode of all time, I think. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  And she's the one who's funny, not me. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=427.74s)]
*  Yes, producer Sam Alberger told me after the recording that it's probably the most he's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=429.58s)]
*  heard you laugh in an episode. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  And he was cracking up as well during it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=435.74s)]
*  So check that one out. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=437.88s)]
*  The last one I add was Alan Taylor. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  I joke because I feel like Alan Taylor is also squarely in the CWT kind of interest, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=442.38s)]
*  area of interest. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=450.78s)]
*  It's history and this episode covers like Revolutionary War history, War of 1812. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=451.94s)]
*  We've got a lot of males, I think a lot of dads and what dad doesn't love military history [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=457.58s)]
*  speaking as a dad. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=462.32s)]
*  So check out Alan Taylor. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=463.73999999999995s)]
*  Another one I'll throw out that was mentioned by fans is Kyla Scanlon. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=466.85999999999996s)]
*  So she wasn't like a, I'm not sure if she cracked the top 10, but she was mentioned [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=469.41999999999996s)]
*  by fans and people particularly appreciated how she kind of turned the tables on you and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=475.34s)]
*  it ended up being an interview of you almost as much as it was an interview of Kyla. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=480.58s)]
*  Great rapport and charisma. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=485.58s)]
*  And she of course is a big star and will continue to climb. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=491.58s)]
*  So those were my picks. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=493.62s)]
*  Listeners, if you have yours, you can still send them in. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  Let me know. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=497.82s)]
*  I'm always curious to hear which ones spoke to people. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=498.82s)]
*  I like the Christopher Kirchhoff episode and how he never said the word um. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=503.34s)]
*  You might edit out an um here and there with Christopher. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=508.3s)]
*  You don't need to edit. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  It's just you get it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=512.54s)]
*  Word for word. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=515.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=516.62s)]
*  I, I, I love that episode for me. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=517.62s)]
*  It was something I know very little about. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=519.66s)]
*  So it was one of those. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=523.12s)]
*  And this is military technology for those of you who don't know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=524.12s)]
*  So the world of procurement and defense and defense technology is not something I know [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=527.74s)]
*  a lot about. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=535.5s)]
*  It is one of those just big door opening episodes or it was for me at least. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=536.62s)]
*  And becoming increasingly important. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=541.02s)]
*  I'm sorry to say it has to. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=542.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=545.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=546.7s)]
*  Let's uh, let's jump into some listener questions. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=547.7s)]
*  We have a lot. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=550.3s)]
*  So we had this one guy who wrote a long document of like very good, very detailed questions [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=551.3s)]
*  to me and he sent it to you. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=555.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=557.94s)]
*  His name is David Kramer. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=558.94s)]
*  I picked, I've got three questions I pulled out. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=559.94s)]
*  He probably has, I don't know, 30 questions. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=562.62s)]
*  They're all very good. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=565.26s)]
*  I'll link to it in the transcript. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=566.34s)]
*  First question from David Kramer. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=568.78s)]
*  I know you think that cinema is the great art medium of the 20th century. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=570.78s)]
*  Do you think there's a chance for video games to eclipse that? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=575.18s)]
*  He asked a couple of questions about video games and I like something we don't talk about [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=578.46s)]
*  on the show a lot, but it's something I think about too. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=582.46s)]
*  On their current trajectory, I don't see that happening. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=585.78s)]
*  I even have people in video games telling me that the seminal games are now all a bit [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=588.9s)]
*  old and it's becoming more derivative. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=593.26s)]
*  So there's something about video games. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=596.66s)]
*  It's too context specific to the person playing it and doing it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=598.3s)]
*  And it doesn't quite manage to generate narrative and vision in a way that is intersubjectively [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=603.06s)]
*  understandable where it could become part of a canon. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=609.26s)]
*  So I'll say no on that one. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=612.14s)]
*  But you don't play video games. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=613.7s)]
*  No, and they've had a lot of time to establish themselves aesthetically. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=615.3s)]
*  And again, the numbers on usage, revenue, everything off the charts, that one cannot [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=619.74s)]
*  deny. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=624.62s)]
*  But in these other areas, I don't really see that they're climbing or have established [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=626.1s)]
*  much of anything. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=630.7s)]
*  Well, one way you could think about the success of video games is how vibrant the subcultures [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=631.7s)]
*  are around video games. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=638.0600000000001s)]
*  And one thing that I get immense joy from is, particularly on YouTube, is there are [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=639.88s)]
*  so many sub genres of criticism or analysis on YouTube about video games. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=646.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think there's something very, for me, very resonant about today where, for instance, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=652.2199999999999s)]
*  there's YouTube channels that just take a look at these big virtual worlds that are [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=658.14s)]
*  created in video games. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=661.38s)]
*  And they say, where do all the rivers go? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=663.16s)]
*  And they try to map the river systems or they try to map the power infrastructure. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=665.5799999999999s)]
*  And there's this feeling you can get where as you're exploring these worlds and you're [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=670.9399999999999s)]
*  always kind of wondering, was this intentional or was this an accident? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=675.14s)]
*  And it can give you a weird feeling of almost the transcendental or something that you're [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=678.86s)]
*  walking around kind of wondering, was this touched by the creator? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=683.98s)]
*  And I find so many of those sub genres so interesting, even if I never play the games [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=688.54s)]
*  myself. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=693.86s)]
*  And I think actually the criticisms and the analysis that you see is really high quality [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=694.86s)]
*  in a way that I don't think many people appreciate outside of video games. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=700.14s)]
*  But I would sooner say that shows the growth of YouTube criticism as an amazing genre, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=704.3s)]
*  which it is. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=708.62s)]
*  So in classical music, there can be recordings that sell three, 400 copies at most. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=709.62s)]
*  And then the number of people who listen to someone doing the critical review of the recording [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=715.3399999999999s)]
*  can be tens or even hundreds of thousands. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=719.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's weird, right? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=722.5799999999999s)]
*  But I think that's the future. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=724.64s)]
*  Are there any people who do critical reviews of CWTs on YouTube? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=726.06s)]
*  Is that a genre yet? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=730.38s)]
*  I haven't encountered it, but I heartily encourage it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=731.9s)]
*  Which sweater did Tyler bring this time? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  Would it be the star? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=738.02s)]
*  They talk about all the weird little things in the episode? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=739.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=742.62s)]
*  I would subscribe to that channel. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=743.62s)]
*  It would get more listens than an actual episode, perhaps, right? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=745.7s)]
*  Possibly so. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=749.22s)]
*  I think it touches on some of the things that we've mentioned even with LLMs and like Econ [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=750.22s)]
*  Goat, the site that we created last year where we published your book and had this AI companion [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=755.06s)]
*  where more and more you can engage with the thing without consuming the thing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=763.54s)]
*  So it might be the criticism on YouTube, or it might be that you ask the LLM to kind of [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=770.8s)]
*  give you the summary and you might get more value out of the derivative product than the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=776.14s)]
*  product itself. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=779.9s)]
*  How about YouTube criticisms of LLMs giving you derivative summaries? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=781.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=786.06s)]
*  We'll just keep following that all the way down. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=787.06s)]
*  Second question from David Kramer. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=790.6999999999999s)]
*  Which cultural code once cracked caused you the strongest update for you, either from [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=792.9399999999999s)]
*  admiration to horror or vice versa? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  Well that's going to be something when you're young, right? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=801.4s)]
*  Almost certainly. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=804.3s)]
*  So when I moved to Germany when I was, I guess, 22 years old to spend a year there, and I [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=805.3s)]
*  had hardly ever been abroad before. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=810.82s)]
*  I'd been to Oxford and London, but in a way that doesn't count, and just had to live there. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=812.94s)]
*  And that was incredible. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=819.1800000000001s)]
*  And every day there were new puzzles to think about and figure out. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=820.1800000000001s)]
*  And I would say in the mid 80s, West Germany then as we called it, was at a kind of peak. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=823.62s)]
*  That is you could go there and wonder, was this a better country, better way of life [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=829.1400000000001s)]
*  than the United States? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=833.0600000000001s)]
*  And you wouldn't be sure. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=834.74s)]
*  You wouldn't really ask that question today. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=836.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, Germany is in trouble in a number of regards. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=838.1s)]
*  But that was just a fantastic year and the most thought provoking year of my life. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=842.1s)]
*  And it was all about cultural codes. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=846.7s)]
*  I also leased a car and drove around a lot to Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=848.26s)]
*  course, other places. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=852.9s)]
*  I haven't heard that part of that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=854.38s)]
*  You leased a car? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=856.26s)]
*  Well, the dollar was very strong back then, right? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=857.26s)]
*  It was right before it plummeted. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=860.94s)]
*  So when I started in Germany, it was like 3.45 marks to the dollar, which people now [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=863.82s)]
*  will forget. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=868.9000000000001s)]
*  But that was an incredible exchange rate, like 2X for the dollar, what it should have [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=869.9000000000001s)]
*  been by PPP. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=873.86s)]
*  Last question from David Kramer. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=876.1s)]
*  Which major branch of traditional art do you have the least native or I think I would say [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=878.0200000000001s)]
*  intrinsic appreciation for? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=882.7s)]
*  Well if by art, that includes music. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=885.86s)]
*  I think Renaissance music, I'm more skeptical of than many people. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=888.62s)]
*  I think it's not until Monteverdi that music truly starts to reach its peaks, that the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=892.9000000000001s)]
*  means are just too limited. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=897.7800000000001s)]
*  And I really quite like or even love William Byrd, Palestrina. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=899.46s)]
*  At the end of the day, for me in music, there is a break with Monteverdi and then Bach. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=903.1400000000001s)]
*  Or I just think it attains much higher levels. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=908.94s)]
*  And a number of people I know will wince to hear me say this. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=912.38s)]
*  But it is my view. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=915.38s)]
*  I just recommended some Renaissance church music to someone. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  I feel like I actually have a higher than normal or higher than average appreciation [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=921.0999999999999s)]
*  for. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=927.6999999999999s)]
*  Which feels weird for me to say that. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=929.6199999999999s)]
*  I don't feel like I have a deep appreciation of many genres of music. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=931.3399999999999s)]
*  But thanks to, and I think you just linked to this again, but thanks to the game, I mentioned [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=934.9799999999999s)]
*  this on the podcast at least a couple times. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=938.9s)]
*  But thanks to I think of Civilization IV, I was playing that game and they play a lot [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=941.38s)]
*  of Renaissance music during the Renaissance period of the game. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=945.18s)]
*  Which composers do they play? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=948.18s)]
*  A lot of choral works, which I find really transportive. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=949.5s)]
*  That's a very good work. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=957.9000000000001s)]
*  And yeah, the music in general is very good. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=959.3000000000001s)]
*  But I actually, a friend of mine was asking for some recommendations. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=962.1800000000001s)]
*  I said, check these out. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=969.3000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=971.9000000000001s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=973.9s)]
*  One listener, Tom, emailed and just had a bunch of questions about demographics and [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=974.9s)]
*  kind of analytic stuff, which I can answer. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=980.98s)]
*  So how many people bail on episodes? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=983.5799999999999s)]
*  On average, people listen to about two thirds of the episodes. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=987.74s)]
*  So when you aggregate everyone's drop off, on average, people are listening to about [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=991.26s)]
*  two thirds of the episode, which is pretty good. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=996.22s)]
*  And that's been very stable for many years. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=999.74s)]
*  Delta between like most popular and least popular. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1002.78s)]
*  YouTube is changing this. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1005.9399999999999s)]
*  Certainly the algorithm drives, you know, virality or popularity more on YouTube than [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1007.9s)]
*  the podcast. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1014.3399999999999s)]
*  So if you just talk about audio downloads, the Delta is not large. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1015.5s)]
*  You know, you might have a 20 or 30 percent difference in downloads between, in say the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1019.5799999999999s)]
*  first week or first month, between Peter Thiel, who was number one this year, and, you know, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1024.26s)]
*  the middle of the pack. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1030.3799999999999s)]
*  And even at the bottom of the pack, it's not much more of that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1031.86s)]
*  On YouTube, it can be, you know, 10 times as many downloads just because once you get [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1034.4599999999998s)]
*  caught up in the algorithm on YouTube, it sweeps you away. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1039.06s)]
*  So right now, someone like Stephen Kotkin has, you know, 10 times the views of Paula [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1042.5s)]
*  Byrne just because Kotkin took off like wildfire and not as many people checking out Paula [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1050.1799999999998s)]
*  Byrne. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1055.54s)]
*  The best rate in getting potential guests to accept, you know, probably like 80 percent, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1058.22s)]
*  probably like implicitly, it's the people we don't ask because we don't have an in [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1064.7s)]
*  with them or we don't sort of know how to reach them that would raise that failure rate [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1069.18s)]
*  higher. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1074.46s)]
*  But for the most part, when we actually get in touch with someone, they say yes. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1075.46s)]
*  There are a few exceptions to that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1079.18s)]
*  Is it hopeless to try Magnus again? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1080.9s)]
*  Someone asked about Magnus. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1083.66s)]
*  We've gotten very close. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1084.74s)]
*  I mean, I think in front of him, I think he's seen it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1086.1399999999999s)]
*  Or is that your impression? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1089.26s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1090.26s)]
*  Or his father has, which probably is more useful, perhaps. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1091.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1094.4199999999998s)]
*  But yeah, we can certainly try again. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1095.4199999999998s)]
*  Let's try again with Magnus. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1097.34s)]
*  I'm willing to fly to him. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1098.5s)]
*  If you Magnus, if you're hearing this, he's not hearing it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1099.9399999999998s)]
*  If someone I'm hearing him, but he's not hearing this. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1104.1s)]
*  If if someone knows Magnus has a connection, please let us know. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1107.26s)]
*  Similarly with Paul McCartney. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1112.1399999999999s)]
*  Someone was asking about Paul McCartney. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1113.5s)]
*  That's a true long shot. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1115.54s)]
*  I don't think we've gotten anywhere near Paul McCartney. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1116.54s)]
*  But if you happen to know Paul, you know, let us put us in touch. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1119.26s)]
*  Put us in touch. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1124.86s)]
*  We're more than happy to have him on. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1125.86s)]
*  How often do we get solicitations from people hoping to be guests? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1128.94s)]
*  Now it's like every day. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1132.58s)]
*  And I'm sure you get some to your email. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  We get some to the generic every weekday for sure. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1137.22s)]
*  Yeah, to the CWT. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1139.94s)]
*  And they're typically boring. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1141.18s)]
*  There's here's my new book. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1142.18s)]
*  And you must think this is a hot topic because corporate America is talking about it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1143.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1147.9s)]
*  There's my new book on the impact of tech on America's youth or something. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1148.9s)]
*  Very cliche, generic topics. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1154.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, nothing, nothing against the people pitching them, but they're usually not at [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1156.7800000000002s)]
*  all targeted to this show. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1160.9s)]
*  And so they're kind of going for more of a more of a topical business or news podcast [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1163.3000000000002s)]
*  than us specifically. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1173.06s)]
*  If the person is actually targeting us more specifically, and it's clear they're actually [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1175.22s)]
*  they've actually done a little bit of homework about the show. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1179.9s)]
*  I will definitely look at it and take a closer look at the guest. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1183.1s)]
*  But when it's a generic one, I don't even I don't even spend a second on it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1188.22s)]
*  I delete it immediately. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1192.58s)]
*  I know that's tough. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1194.18s)]
*  I know when you're pitching lots of shows, that's that's tough to do. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1195.18s)]
*  But they should make a case that the person is an impressive polymath, even if they've [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1199.06s)]
*  done nothing and have no book. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1204.3s)]
*  Yeah, that we would consider. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1205.86s)]
*  Yeah, the person has done something very strange. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1207.58s)]
*  I mean, perhaps with their their body, like we're trying to get this woman who has climbed [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1211.3s)]
*  Mount Everest right more than anyone else. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1215.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1217.62s)]
*  We should try her again. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1218.62s)]
*  I know she didn't respond, but I don't think it's a waste of time. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1219.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1226.82s)]
*  How would you rate the current development of your previous ideas that you've popularized [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1228.1799999999998s)]
*  on the blog? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1232.82s)]
*  How subsequent events vindicated or called into questions ideas such as the Great Stagnation [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1233.82s)]
*  Average is Over State Capacity Libertarianism. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1237.58s)]
*  That's from GK. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1240.06s)]
*  Well the Great Stagnation, I think, was seen as radical when I stated it in 2011. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1242.34s)]
*  It's now widely considered to have been true. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1247.82s)]
*  I think it's over. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1250.5s)]
*  Not everyone thinks it's over. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1251.74s)]
*  with AI and advances in biomedical science that ended a few years ago. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1253.78s)]
*  But I think that one turned out very well. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1258.3799999999999s)]
*  Basically, Average is Over is a story in the works. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1261.06s)]
*  Will artificial intelligence boost or lower income inequality? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  That we don't know yet. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1270.8999999999999s)]
*  But the predictions I made in my book Average is Over that AI would be the next big thing [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1272.18s)]
*  and it would all be about how well can you work with AI. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1277.3s)]
*  That's done very, very well. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1280.46s)]
*  So I think I deserve more credit for those predictions, in fact. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1281.9s)]
*  And state capacity libertarianism. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1286.8600000000001s)]
*  I still hear the phrase all the time. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1289.26s)]
*  Like Vivek once reached out to me a few months ago and he said, oh, I love state capacity [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1292.7800000000002s)]
*  libertarianism. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1297.16s)]
*  Let's meet and talk about this. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1298.16s)]
*  Now we'll see what comes of that. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1299.8200000000002s)]
*  But when I wrote that post, I was convinced like this was going nowhere. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1301.76s)]
*  And it's still a thing. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1305.5s)]
*  So I'm not saying it's a thing that will succeed. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1306.8200000000002s)]
*  But I think as libertarianism more narrowly has scattered and diffused, it's one of the [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1309.92s)]
*  strands that's still alive. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1315.4s)]
*  So I'm hopeful. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1317.28s)]
*  Another question. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1318.8400000000001s)]
*  You are in a sense both an insider and an outsider to the econ profession. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1319.88s)]
*  What parts of the profession do you feel are most underrated and most overrated? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1324.04s)]
*  I think I'm mainly just an outsider, not an insider. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1328.72s)]
*  The thing that is most overrated is just entry barriers in terms of bureaucratization are [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1334.68s)]
*  higher and higher. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1343.2s)]
*  You have to have gone to a very good undergraduate school, have letters of recommendation from [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1344.8200000000002s)]
*  highly credible people, maybe have done a pre-doc. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1349.04s)]
*  And that's ruining it for people. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1352.5600000000002s)]
*  I know at least five truly talented individuals who are teenagers at first thought they wanted [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1353.96s)]
*  to become economists. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1360.38s)]
*  Then learned what was involved and just thought I'll never really quite be able to get anything [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1362.5s)]
*  done going this path. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1367.58s)]
*  And now they're all doing other things. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1369.48s)]
*  And in no case do I feel like I should be nagging them telling them, oh, you really [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1371.9s)]
*  should have done economics. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1375.76s)]
*  They probably shouldn't have. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1377.18s)]
*  So that's the biggest problem. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1379.3400000000001s)]
*  Many people are aware of it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1380.72s)]
*  But it's one of these I'm aware of it and not going to do anything about it sorts of [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1382.56s)]
*  issues. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1386.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1387.5s)]
*  Now what's most underrated? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1388.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1393.58s)]
*  I mean, the quality of the median paper is pretty high. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1394.58s)]
*  I don't know if it's underrated, but just the standards and the care you have to put [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1396.54s)]
*  into it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1401.22s)]
*  But that's related to the entry barriers being higher. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1402.22s)]
*  So it's a trade off. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1405.18s)]
*  I think economics is a lot less fun and actually less impactful than it used to be. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1407.38s)]
*  The Biden administration relied much less on economists than the Obama administration [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1413.02s)]
*  did. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1418.42s)]
*  Trump will see what happens, but I would bet against academic economists being highly influential [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1419.82s)]
*  there, maybe in very indirect roundabout ways, but not in the standard sense that they're [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1424.86s)]
*  given credit and invited in on the red carpet. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1429.54s)]
*  So as a profession, I mean, we're losing status and influence and that should be a radical [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1432.9s)]
*  wake up call. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1437.48s)]
*  And I don't see that we're heating it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1438.48s)]
*  We're doubling down on previous strategies and we're going to regret that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1440.14s)]
*  A lot more economists should be doing podcasts is one way to put it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1445.46s)]
*  And why should they not be excellent at it? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1449.46s)]
*  If they're smart people who have things to say, they have plenty of experience giving [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1451.5s)]
*  seminars, teaching. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1455.3400000000001s)]
*  They should be great at doing podcasts. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1457.3400000000001s)]
*  A lot of them are not, frankly, looking back at past history, but that itself tells you [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1459.0200000000002s)]
*  something. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1463.6200000000001s)]
*  Relatedly, another question from Steve. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1464.6200000000001s)]
*  How should places such as the Mercatus Center measure success? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1467.5s)]
*  He talks about the Cato Institute. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1471.96s)]
*  When they report, they list a bunch of their outputs, op-eds, congressional meetings, so [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1474.1s)]
*  on. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1478.3s)]
*  But how do you map that to your mission? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1479.3s)]
*  Well every nonprofit does and should create reports and metrics. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1482.26s)]
*  But ultimately, my view is if you've really succeeded, you know it without measuring it. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1486.46s)]
*  And it's just obvious. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1491.78s)]
*  So take Ralph Nader. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1494.18s)]
*  I don't agree with a lot of what Ralph Nader did, but he's, I think, still around and he [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1497.0600000000002s)]
*  had a big impact. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1502.6200000000001s)]
*  And I could go out and measure Ralph Nader in different ways, but I don't need to. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1503.6200000000001s)]
*  Peter Singer. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1508.9s)]
*  Has Peter Singer gotten his way on most issues? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1509.9s)]
*  I would say no. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1511.9s)]
*  But has he made many more people vegetarians and probably influenced pro-animal legislation? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1513.22s)]
*  I would say definitely yes. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1520.14s)]
*  And I've never measured that. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1521.8200000000002s)]
*  So it's when you don't need to measure that you have real successes. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1523.34s)]
*  What are our successes say in the past year at Mercatus that you think you just know it [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1526.98s)]
*  without having to measure it? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1531.3s)]
*  We've changed minds, changed behaviors or attitudes. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1533.4199999999998s)]
*  Well it depends what you mean by the phrase at Mercatus. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1536.8999999999999s)]
*  So Hester Pierce used to work here. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1539.58s)]
*  She studied crypto for us. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1541.8999999999999s)]
*  She has since become a commissioner at the SEC. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1543.76s)]
*  Due to her heroic efforts, crypto is still alive and well. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1546.52s)]
*  It's a Hester Triumph, not a Mercatus in the narrow sense triumph, but that's exactly [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1550.54s)]
*  the kind of thing we should be trying to do. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1555.5s)]
*  Someone said on Twitter recently that there's no limit to what you can achieve if you're [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1558.52s)]
*  willing not to get much credit for it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1563.76s)]
*  And I think that should be our attitude to some extent. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1566.52s)]
*  It is our attitude. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1569.1399999999999s)]
*  And what would Mercatus be without its people, to paraphrase? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1571.1399999999999s)]
*  Someone else. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1575.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1576.06s)]
*  Which guests have had the biggest impact on you in the past year? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1578.66s)]
*  That's from Alan Wright. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1581.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1582.66s)]
*  Impact on me. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1585.3000000000002s)]
*  Maybe even in your research. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1587.5400000000002s)]
*  The collective set of guests take up most of my time. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1588.5400000000002s)]
*  That's impact. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1592.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1593.8200000000002s)]
*  But you couldn't pin that on any one guest. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1594.8200000000002s)]
*  Who is the most? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1597.22s)]
*  Masaki Suzuki invited me to his Handel's Messiah concert on December 20th and I'm going to [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1598.22s)]
*  go. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1603.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1604.66s)]
*  So that's impact and I'm sure it will be magnificent. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1605.66s)]
*  That's wonderful. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1607.38s)]
*  Who is your most difficult prep, you think, looking over this list this year? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1610.6200000000001s)]
*  Most difficult prep? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1615.42s)]
*  Oh, it's probably Stephen Kotkin. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1616.42s)]
*  That took the most reading. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1618.5800000000002s)]
*  And then Alan Taylor. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1619.74s)]
*  They're the two historians. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1621.14s)]
*  Almost always historians are the hardest. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1623.0800000000002s)]
*  But another difficult prep was Philip Ball, who wrote so many books on science. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1626.2800000000002s)]
*  Science you can't prep for. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1634.8600000000001s)]
*  You can just read more books. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1636.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1637.82s)]
*  And if you're an economist, you know some history anyway through economic history. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1638.82s)]
*  But a body of work in science, it's like, oh, do I start reading a biology text or something? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1643.22s)]
*  So he was hard as well. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1648.3s)]
*  Another reason Kotkin and Alan Taylor are underrated then is you've got to make Tyler's [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1651.64s)]
*  prep worth it. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1658.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1659.42s)]
*  Well, I learned more from doing those people. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1660.7s)]
*  So say when I did Joseph Stiglitz, I had already read his major pieces, indeed many [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1663.96s)]
*  of his minor pieces over the years. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1669.18s)]
*  It hardly took any prep. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1671.48s)]
*  But I learned less too. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1673.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1676.88s)]
*  Another guest that's had a big impact on you, Rick Rubin. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1678.3s)]
*  This is related to that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1681.6000000000001s)]
*  If you were a DJ in a different life, what kind of music would you play and where would [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1683.28s)]
*  you perform? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1686.54s)]
*  Also what would, same question for DJ Tyrone. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1688.0s)]
*  This is from Bart DeRuys. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1691.8s)]
*  Well I love music of all sorts. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1694.1599999999999s)]
*  I've done some DJing for Rick and I played for him a lot of what is misnamed world music, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1696.12s)]
*  but from different countries such as Madagascar or Pygmy music or, you know, Algerian rap [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1702.54s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1708.24s)]
*  I love playing Paul McCartney for people. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1710.6s)]
*  I feel I know that area very well. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1713.04s)]
*  We have an episode coming up with Ian Leslie and he'd better be ready because I'm ready. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1715.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't need to prep for him. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1720.04s)]
*  He has this new book coming out on John Lennon and Paul McCartney. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1721.64s)]
*  I feel I've never been more ready for an episode. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1724.72s)]
*  So I think good DJing, you should surprise people and mix in a lot of different things. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1727.96s)]
*  And Tyrone would feel the same way. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1733.5600000000002s)]
*  But what would his artist be? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1736.3000000000002s)]
*  Maybe he'd just play atonal music for people, but Tyler would do that too. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1738.5200000000002s)]
*  So Tyler and Tyrone merge when it comes to music. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1742.5600000000002s)]
*  Tyler has a little more empathy for the group. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1745.92s)]
*  I'm not sure about that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1749.0s)]
*  Any update on Jonas, the person in Ethiopia you supported? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1752.3200000000002s)]
*  He and his wife had another baby. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1757.24s)]
*  The war is over in the immediate sense. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1760.0800000000002s)]
*  Their food problems have been alleviated. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1763.76s)]
*  He does not have enough money to complete his house, which is a big problem for him. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1766.74s)]
*  They're back on their feet, but it's very tough. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1771.24s)]
*  And tourist demand for the business he wanted to create has not materialized because of [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1774.0800000000002s)]
*  the war. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1778.36s)]
*  And he's performed very admirably. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1780.1599999999999s)]
*  But Ethiopia has let him down, I would say. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1784.36s)]
*  I think you commented at the time it was more difficult than it should have been to get [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1788.9599999999998s)]
*  him the money when you supported him. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1793.6399999999999s)]
*  It required some jumping through hoops. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1796.56s)]
*  Is that still the case? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1798.56s)]
*  I now have an electronic payments network set up. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1800.24s)]
*  The first time I used it, my bank canceled my account. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1803.6999999999998s)]
*  I had to go in person because it does look sketchy to be sending just a single transfer [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1807.6399999999999s)]
*  to Ethiopia all of a sudden. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1812.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that's resolved, but I'm afraid the next time I send, they'll cancel my account [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1815.3999999999999s)]
*  again. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1819.8s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1820.8s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1821.8s)]
*  Payments in the United States is still screwed up. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1822.8s)]
*  Stripe has done amazing work. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1826.08s)]
*  I hope they keep on going. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1827.48s)]
*  I'm pretty sure they will, but it still all needs fixing. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1828.6799999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1832.24s)]
*  Question from DB. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1834.04s)]
*  Respectfully and in a spirit of good intention. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1835.4399999999998s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1838.04s)]
*  It's not as bad as you think. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1839.04s)]
*  Why is it that you seem to dislike measures to make practical cycling in cities safer [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1841.1599999999999s)]
*  and more comfortable? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1845.12s)]
*  So you've had a number of posts where you kind of say that the idea that people, I think, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1846.12s)]
*  correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I would summarize you is you think it's without evidence, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1852.04s)]
*  you know, installing bike lanes and these things, the ROI is not there to you. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1856.48s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1861.4399999999998s)]
*  Correct. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1862.4399999999998s)]
*  As far as I can tell from the numbers I've seen, use of DC bike lanes has been declining. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1863.44s)]
*  I suspect it's not the future. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1868.96s)]
*  It's a relatively slow and late 19th century mode of transport. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1871.76s)]
*  If you look at downtown Washington, it's much harder to drive around in. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1877.0s)]
*  I get that's partly by design, but there is a real economic cost to that. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1880.44s)]
*  And the bike lanes are mostly empty. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1884.8s)]
*  It does seem to work for much of Manhattan. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1887.44s)]
*  I think one should be an empiricist. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1889.88s)]
*  I know Amsterdam and Copenhagen quite well. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1891.72s)]
*  It works great there. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1894.8400000000001s)]
*  Houston decided not to do it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1896.5600000000002s)]
*  That was almost certainly the correct decision. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1898.22s)]
*  So one should be an empiricist. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1900.78s)]
*  And I think bike lanes are, by the people I come into contact with, very much overrated. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1902.3600000000001s)]
*  If you ask the simple question, where's the cost benefit analysis that adds up all the [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1909.6000000000001s)]
*  costs? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1913.92s)]
*  I never see it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1914.92s)]
*  No one has ever sent me one. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1915.92s)]
*  Ever. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1917.4s)]
*  And I did a long post. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1918.4s)]
*  There were a large number of comments. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1919.9s)]
*  People would say things like, oh, you dummy, don't you see Copenhagen's a great city? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1922.14s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1925.42s)]
*  It's worked well there. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1926.42s)]
*  But at the margin, how many American cities should make big investments in this direction? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1927.42s)]
*  I still want to see the cost benefit analysis, and no one's coming up with it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1932.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1936.46s)]
*  And if you send me one that is serious in taking all the costs into account, including [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1937.94s)]
*  the cost of the land, I will read it and indeed review it. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1942.64s)]
*  But some kind of partial, oh, here's a few people who are better off because we put bike [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1946.0600000000002s)]
*  lanes in. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1949.78s)]
*  I'll look at it, but no, I'm not going to review that. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1950.78s)]
*  And that's what people have been sending me. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1953.1s)]
*  You published your list of the best new books of the year, and we'll get to those, at least [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1955.98s)]
*  for 2014. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1960.1399999999999s)]
*  What about the best new ideas? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1961.1399999999999s)]
*  That's from Bob Ewing. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1963.1s)]
*  Do we have new ideas? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1965.42s)]
*  I mean, generative AI, you wouldn't quite call it a new idea, but it has reached new [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1966.82s)]
*  peaks and the very best models. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1972.46s)]
*  Obviously, O1 Pro for GPT is right now the best model, and it's just astonishing. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1976.26s)]
*  It beats humans at most things. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1983.74s)]
*  Today or is it yesterday, the new Google video model came out. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1986.3799999999999s)]
*  I haven't played around with it yet. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1989.3799999999999s)]
*  People say it's incredible. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1991.08s)]
*  So those are the new ideas that matter, and the rest is often people just spinning their [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1992.9399999999998s)]
*  wheels. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1997.74s)]
*  It's not a great time for new ideas in books. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=1998.74s)]
*  The new ideas are all stuff, also in biomedicine, and it's just been incredible, mind-blowing. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2002.18s)]
*  You've said before that the best ideas are the things people do. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2008.38s)]
*  They're embedded in the projects people do, so like LLMs would be one. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2012.46s)]
*  But that's a recent development. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2017.38s)]
*  So say 10, 15 years ago, you had all these new semi-popular, semi-serious science, economics [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2018.8200000000002s)]
*  books. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2025.0600000000002s)]
*  A lot of them had new ideas. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2026.0600000000002s)]
*  You could say Jared Diamond started that trend. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2027.3s)]
*  It now seems to me mostly over. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2030.18s)]
*  Those books seem a bit flat at the moment. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2032.52s)]
*  We're waiting for people to reinvent the book. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2039.14s)]
*  We tried our own version of that. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2041.06s)]
*  Thank you again for your help with Goat, econgoat.ai. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2042.5800000000002s)]
*  But those are the new ideas for doing things. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2046.2s)]
*  Well, what about maybe we're stretching what's an idea versus say an initiative, but in the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2048.54s)]
*  policy world we have DOGE. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2054.42s)]
*  Would you count that as a new idea? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2056.9s)]
*  I'm all for it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2058.98s)]
*  I hope it succeeds, but I don't think it's a new idea. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2060.02s)]
*  If you read David Stockman's old book, The Triumph of Politics, they tried a version [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2062.94s)]
*  of that in the first term of the Reagan administration. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2067.22s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2070.06s)]
*  They're trying it again. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2071.06s)]
*  I think they'll try harder and with the benefit of knowledge of failures in the meantime. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2072.06s)]
*  But no, I don't see it as a new idea. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2078.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2079.86s)]
*  Well, we're also going to have Jennifer Polka on to talk more about that in the new year, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2080.86s)]
*  so look out for that one. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2085.14s)]
*  And settling more is not a new idea. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2086.66s)]
*  Let's root for it, but it'll be tough and it's not new. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2089.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2093.94s)]
*  What supplements do you take? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2096.54s)]
*  How do you feel about the life extension projects that are out and about? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2098.58s)]
*  That's from Nicholas Krauss. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2101.8999999999996s)]
*  I drink mineral water. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2103.62s)]
*  Does that count as a supplement? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2105.14s)]
*  Why not? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2106.62s)]
*  I don't take a lot of medications. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2109.06s)]
*  I don't take medications in general. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2112.06s)]
*  I'm skeptical. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2114.5s)]
*  I think life expectancy will continue to increase slowly. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2118.7s)]
*  My guess is there's some natural limit due to the brain at somewhere between 100 and [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2123.42s)]
*  120. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2128.22s)]
*  And I don't see how you repair the brain without replacing who is the person. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2129.46s)]
*  So I don't think individuals can live forever. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2133.9s)]
*  But to get to the point where large numbers of people who buckle their seat belts live [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2137.26s)]
*  well into their nineties, I expect we're on the way to doing that right now. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2142.06s)]
*  Your kids might be able to expect to live well into their nineties, for instance. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2147.34s)]
*  How long would you like to live in an ideal world in your body? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2152.3s)]
*  As long as I can. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2156.22s)]
*  As long as there is history to follow, I won't be bored. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2157.94s)]
*  So I'm not worried about that. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2161.68s)]
*  I'm the same way. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2164.42s)]
*  Some people say, no, I don't want to live forever because then all of your people around [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2165.96s)]
*  you presumably will start dying unless they're just also, I guess, buckling their seatbelts [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2171.14s)]
*  and taking the same non-supplements. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2177.42s)]
*  Bye bye. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2179.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I already know a lot of people have passed away. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2180.2999999999997s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2182.98s)]
*  But I've kept on going. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2184.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2186.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2187.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2188.66s)]
*  I like life. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2189.66s)]
*  And I have a lot of new friends also. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2190.66s)]
*  You have to, you know, as you get older, you need to make real efforts to make and keep [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2191.66s)]
*  new friends. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2195.46s)]
*  But you can do it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2197.02s)]
*  Rick Rubin or Noam Dorman, they're like pretty new friends for me. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2198.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2203.1s)]
*  To me, to be maybe a little glib, it's sort of like not getting a new pet because your [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2204.1s)]
*  old pet died and just being a little fatalistic of like, I'm not going to bring joy into my [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2208.42s)]
*  life because that joy might end. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2213.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2217.18s)]
*  I, if there's anyone out there who can help me with this, I'd love to live. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2218.18s)]
*  I'd love to live longer than, than say 80 or 90. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2221.9s)]
*  A lot of Emergent Ventures winners are working on this. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2225.2599999999998s)]
*  My guess is they'll simply help us live to a hundred, which is still a great investment. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2228.2599999999998s)]
*  But many of them think aging is a specific thing that can be stopped or reversed or cured [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2233.1s)]
*  like you can cure a disease. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2239.2999999999997s)]
*  I hope they're right. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2241.02s)]
*  We've made bets on them. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2243.7s)]
*  But if you just ask me what I think, I do think there's an upper limit that is more [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2244.7s)]
*  or less at where the oldest living people live to today, which is like about 110 perhaps. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2248.8199999999997s)]
*  Maybe we can get that up to 120. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2255.08s)]
*  Listener PK asks, how do you invest your own money? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2257.92s)]
*  Buy, hold and diversify. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2263.52s)]
*  I do very little. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2265.08s)]
*  I don't sell things. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2266.08s)]
*  Don't really rebalance as I save more, buy more stuff. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2268.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2271.7999999999997s)]
*  There's nothing interesting about that story. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think I can beat the market and I don't try to. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2274.24s)]
*  I'm wondering if they, I should say, are also asking this question because of your challenge [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2278.64s)]
*  to people to short the market if they're bearish on things. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2285.8399999999997s)]
*  Have you ever yourself taken out of financial position that kind of bet on your belief in [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2289.2s)]
*  that way? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2293.2799999999997s)]
*  I've never shorted anything. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2294.4s)]
*  Note that my wife works for the SEC, so I'm not allowed to short anything legally. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2296.56s)]
*  In fact, a lot of individual stocks I can't buy. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2300.3599999999997s)]
*  All I can do is in fact what I want to do anyway, but is buy, hold and diversify. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2304.6s)]
*  But I have no degrees of freedom in this. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2309.56s)]
*  So make of that what you will. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2311.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2313.56s)]
*  And I'm optimistic. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2314.56s)]
*  I don't want to short the market even if I could. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2315.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2320.04s)]
*  Let's move on to pop culture picks. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2321.2s)]
*  So for many, many years on the marginal revolution, you've been listing your best, your favorite [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2323.48s)]
*  nonfiction fiction movies from the year. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2328.4s)]
*  It's tradition on this show to look back a decade ago. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2331.24s)]
*  So in this case, 2014 and look at your picks. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2335.3199999999997s)]
*  I always forget to prep for this and I ought to know by now. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2337.56s)]
*  I'm silly. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2340.4399999999996s)]
*  So 2014 also coincides. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2341.9599999999996s)]
*  I joined Mercatus in October, 2014. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2344.7599999999998s)]
*  So the snake is kind of eating the tail here where up to now these picks have been before [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2347.08s)]
*  I joined Mercatus and before CWT got started. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2351.7599999999998s)]
*  But next year when we do this, CWT will have begun. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2354.2s)]
*  Picks that will be reflected in the list. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2358.84s)]
*  Now starting with nonfiction, there are a lot. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2361.7200000000003s)]
*  There are way too many, I think, to go by one by one. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2365.2000000000003s)]
*  So let me just mention the ones where there is some connection with CWT. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2368.4s)]
*  So interestingly, you, one of the books you mentioned was Stephen Kotkin's Stalin Volume [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2374.1600000000003s)]
*  One. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2379.7200000000003s)]
*  So that was one of the greatest biographies of all time. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2380.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2382.76s)]
*  An incredible achievement. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2383.76s)]
*  So we've got Adam Tooze, The Deluge, The Great War and the Remaking of World Order, 1916, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2385.4s)]
*  1931. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2391.0s)]
*  You say it starts slow, but after about 13% becomes fascinating, especially about the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2392.0s)]
*  internal politics in Germany and Russia. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2396.28s)]
*  I must have read that on Kindle if I said 13%. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2398.6400000000003s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2402.0200000000004s)]
*  We've got Tooze and Kotkin on there. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2403.0200000000004s)]
*  Tooze was on, I think, in 2020. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2405.2000000000003s)]
*  Other books that you mentioned, I can't, there are probably maybe 30 books listed here. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2409.1600000000003s)]
*  But we have Piketty's Second Machine Age, Tim Harford had a book, Megha McCurdle's Upside [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2415.48s)]
*  It Down, Lane Kenworthy and Social Democracy. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2421.28s)]
*  These are all people that are kind of in your network, you say. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2424.32s)]
*  Fourth Revolution by John Mickle Thwait, Daniel Dresner, The System Worked, Frank Buckley, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2426.88s)]
*  Why the Canadian System Government is Better, Russ Roberts, How Adam Smith Can Change Your [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2431.92s)]
*  Life. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2435.92s)]
*  So there's another CWT. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2436.92s)]
*  I'm not sure the Frank Buckley book has held up well. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2437.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2439.6s)]
*  New Zealand just resigned as we're recording and Trudeau is very unpopular and Canada is [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2440.6s)]

*  But better because there's more of a plot than just a thought exercise, which is what [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2676.6000000000004s)]
*  people loved about The Martian is this extended thought exercise. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2681.6800000000003s)]
*  It's got that in Project Hail Mary, but also a really exciting narrative. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2684.84s)]
*  They're making a movie. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2688.76s)]
*  I think Lord and Miller are attached to it. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2690.24s)]
*  Lord and Miller are known for their kind of comedy. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2692.8799999999997s)]

*  You say kicking it off, I found this to be a diffuse year in movies, one where old style [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2729.56s)]
*  mainline releases lost their grip and open up the market for more quality and diversity. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2734.1200000000003s)]
*  My cinematic self came away from the year quite happy, yet without a clear favorite [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2739.32s)]
*  or a definite sense of which movies will last the ages. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2742.6s)]
*  Well, let's see how well they've aged over 10 years. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2745.32s)]

*  Was that the documentary? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2761.72s)]
*  It's a science documentary about the Hadrian Collider. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2762.72s)]

*  weird. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2815.44s)]

*  Godzilla. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2842.68s)]
*  This was the one with like Brian Cranston was the lead. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2844.6s)]
*  There's been so many Godzilla movies, but this one was just called Godzilla. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2849.56s)]
*  I try to see them all. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2853.04s)]
*  I never regret it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2854.3999999999996s)]
*  I can't quite defend them, but that itself tells you something about aesthetics. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2855.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this is the one directed by Gareth Edwards. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2859.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know which one I meant, but again, I've never regretted seeing a single Godzilla [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2862.64s)]
*  movie in my entire life. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2866.8399999999997s)]
*  Transformers 4. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2869.72s)]
*  That's the great one. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2870.72s)]
*  Again, it has become iconic. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2871.72s)]
*  It's just action every moment, visually complex, highly inventive, and is underrated by serious [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2874.04s)]
*  film critics. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2880.44s)]
*  And I don't like the other Transformers movies. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2881.7999999999997s)]
*  They're just silly, but not 4, right? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2883.8399999999997s)]
*  You're making me want to watch Transformers 4. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2888.48s)]
*  I dropped out on the Transformers series. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2890.88s)]
*  You were rational, but yet the world will surprise us sometimes. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2893.4s)]
*  Obvious Child. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2898.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, give me some more context. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2899.1600000000003s)]
*  Let me find... [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2901.52s)]
*  It's a Paul Simon song, Obvious Child. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2902.52s)]
*  That comes to mind too quickly and it blocks the movie from my mind. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2904.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a romantic comedy written and directed by Gillian Robespierre. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2908.6s)]
*  Stars Jenny Slate, Gabby Hoffman, David Cross. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2914.56s)]
*  Not sure. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2917.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2918.96s)]
*  Elo Elo, a movie from Singapore about a Filipina immigrant. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2920.96s)]
*  Excellent film and a good look at the other side of Singaporean life that people don't [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2925.64s)]
*  always see. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2930.0s)]
*  The one I love. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2931.44s)]
*  This is a movie starring Mark Duplass and Elizabeth Moss. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2933.58s)]
*  It's an indie movie where they go to... [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2939.64s)]
*  This is kind of a hard movie to summarize, but as I recall, they're in kind of a vacation [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  home together and realize that they're interacting with clones of their partner. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2954.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, she's very good in that. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2960.96s)]
*  It's an interesting film. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2962.44s)]
*  I'm probably botching that summary a little bit, but it's very good. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2964.3199999999997s)]
*  I also checked that one out. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2967.4s)]
*  Skeleton Twins. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2968.68s)]
*  Skeleton Twins. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2969.68s)]
*  Give me some context. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2971.72s)]
*  Context is not what you're scared of. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2972.72s)]
*  Let me be your human LLM. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2975.7599999999998s)]
*  Another American comedy. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2977.24s)]
*  I don't know this one by name either, but this starred Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2979.0s)]
*  Twins Milo and Maggie have an unexpected reunion after a set of near tragedies. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2983.64s)]
*  Comedies I tend to forget, but I don't mean that as a criticism of comedies. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2991.3999999999996s)]
*  You can't really rewatch them. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2995.72s)]
*  You just watch them once and then forget about it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=2997.7s)]
*  That's optimal. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3000.3399999999997s)]
*  Lucy, your second Scarlett Johansson movie. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3001.98s)]
*  Yeah, she is amazing. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3005.9399999999996s)]
*  Fury, that's the World War II tank movie with Brad Pitt. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3008.98s)]
*  I like World War II movies. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3014.02s)]
*  That's one of the good ones. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3016.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3017.06s)]
*  Litz was the one this year. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3018.06s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3019.62s)]
*  I watched Fury in the past year. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3020.62s)]
*  I enjoyed it. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3023.42s)]
*  Again, for all my military dads out there, if you haven't checked out Fury, that is a [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3024.42s)]
*  great World War II movie. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3030.5s)]
*  Interstellar. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3033.38s)]
*  There's been some commentary. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3034.38s)]
*  I don't like that anymore. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3036.7000000000003s)]
*  I think it's a bit unwatchable. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3038.86s)]
*  I know it's the iconic movie for men. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3040.46s)]
*  It's all over Twitter. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3043.16s)]
*  Tech people love it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3044.38s)]
*  I don't think Christopher Nolan's a good movie maker. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3045.7400000000002s)]
*  I know that's heresy, but it's all too excess. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3049.58s)]
*  It's not really tinged with actual drama for the most part, only in some scenes. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3053.9s)]
*  So I'm going to nix that one. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3058.7s)]
*  But are you throwing out the baby with the bathwater? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3061.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to throw it all out. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3063.74s)]
*  The baby, the bathwater, the tub. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3065.14s)]
*  Let's just throw it all out. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3067.5s)]
*  Isn't this just like Oppenheimer? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3068.5s)]
*  You've got just a bad taste in your mouth with Oppenheimer. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3070.02s)]
*  I mean, surely it's not all bad with Nolan. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3072.62s)]
*  The second reason promises me that Tenet makes sense. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3076.18s)]
*  He's probably correct. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3079.8999999999996s)]
*  It might be a great movie. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3082.2599999999998s)]
*  I might try it again, but I don't know. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3084.74s)]
*  I think there's some way in which there's just too much on the screen. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3087.22s)]
*  It's not properly cinematic somehow. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3094.8999999999996s)]
*  I have a soft spot for Interstellar. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3101.18s)]
*  I totally get the criticisms of Interstellar, particularly that it kind of all collapses [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3103.34s)]
*  into love being a force of nature, like gravity is, which I know for sci-fi focus is just [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3108.6600000000003s)]
*  not what you want. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3118.54s)]
*  And it's just too parasitic on its own special effects. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3120.1000000000004s)]
*  But I do appreciate, just on a production level, I appreciate Nolan. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3124.02s)]
*  I think you're underrating the craftsmanship of those films, even from just a production [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3128.3399999999997s)]
*  design approach. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3134.74s)]
*  I think they're very good. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3136.1s)]
*  I agree with that, but it matters less to me. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3138.14s)]
*  And I guess I'll never be a guest on this show now. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3140.58s)]
*  You picked Fury number one, summing up, and along with A Touch of Sin, you say both of [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3145.74s)]
*  them need to be seen on a large screen. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3151.18s)]
*  Touch of Sin is really the one that has become a big deal. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3153.3399999999997s)]
*  You include a TV pick, you say the modern Orthodox Jewish dating show Shrugim? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3157.86s)]
*  Yeah, Shrugim, which is incredible. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3162.94s)]
*  It's now massively popular. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3165.7400000000002s)]
*  I feel very good about that pick and highly recommended. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3167.42s)]
*  And the problem with a lot of romance today is where does the drama come from? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3172.5s)]
*  They get to sleep with each other too quickly, or if someone needs to divorce, it just happens. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3179.2200000000003s)]
*  So Victorian literature had solutions to these problems. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3184.42s)]
*  And Shrugim, which covers modern Orthodox in contemporary Israel, has solutions as well. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3187.86s)]
*  It's a great, great TV show. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3193.5s)]
*  I'd say one of the best ever made. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3195.02s)]
*  And if you like it, you'll like it right away. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3197.2200000000003s)]
*  It's not one of these, you need to sit through three episodes and then make up your mind. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3198.94s)]
*  So looking back over nonfiction fiction, I'm not sure if you picked music. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3202.94s)]
*  I didn't see it, but apologies if I missed the music picks. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3207.94s)]
*  But if you go to MR, you can look at the data archives and find out for yourself. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3210.94s)]
*  Looking back over these lists, how do you think they've aged? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3216.78s)]
*  I'm biased, but I think extremely well. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3221.46s)]
*  And I think that was a great year for many things. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3223.58s)]
*  It wasn't a great year for the resumption of high speed economic growth, or maybe not [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3227.06s)]
*  technological progress. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3232.98s)]
*  But it was a calm, stagnation rich year where people were remarkably creative. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3235.14s)]
*  Very good. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3242.18s)]
*  In aesthetics. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3243.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3244.18s)]
*  Let us move on to something new for us this year. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3245.18s)]
*  So you have another document in front of you, actually several documents. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3247.54s)]
*  We have asked listeners to send us ideas for a name that we can use to describe the collective [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3252.66s)]
*  fan base. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3258.3199999999997s)]
*  And basically there's a functional reason for this of like when we address emails to [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3259.58s)]
*  Instead of Dear Listener, we kind of want to have a name for everyone. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3263.9s)]
*  So Dear Blank, you know, Taylor Swift fans are called Swifties. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3268.54s)]
*  We're interested in developing our own version of that. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3272.06s)]
*  We got a bunch of suggestions. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3274.78s)]
*  I would ask you to browse this list. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3278.06s)]
*  We're going to narrow it down to a short list and then ask folks to vote on it. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3280.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll start reading off some of these and you can tell me if any jump out to you. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3284.66s)]
*  We have the underrated or underrated. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3289.64s)]
*  How about the overrated? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3292.54s)]
*  So there are every variation. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3294.62s)]
*  So there's the correctly rated. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3296.06s)]
*  But if winner's curse holds, like we're pursuing them as an audience and that's winner's curse [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3297.06s)]
*  for us. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3301.98s)]
*  Like we've bid too much for their loyalty. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3302.98s)]
*  So we must be overrating them would be the simple economic argument. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3305.46s)]
*  So it has to be the overrated. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3308.68s)]
*  Tyler writes none of these should have my name in it. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3311.1s)]
*  I agree. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3313.82s)]
*  I actually I love some of them, but I think it's against the spirit of the show that it [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3314.82s)]
*  use your name. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3319.22s)]
*  What about the guests more than anything else? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3320.22s)]
*  But I would say but just to name some of the ones that do include your names. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3322.58s)]
*  I love cowanauts. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3327.98s)]
*  That just that just rolls off the tongue. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3329.62s)]
*  Infovores maybe is good because that if anything binds our listeners, it might be that I like [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3333.02s)]
*  infovores. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3337.54s)]
*  There's a you know, CWT years. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3338.74s)]
*  There's no one else will know what that means. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3340.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3343.8599999999997s)]
*  The tycoons again, if we use your name, the marginal revolutionaries. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3344.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, I think we have to save that for the other podcasts. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3348.54s)]
*  Let's see if there's any other ones I really liked. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3352.46s)]
*  I'll say infovores if it's up to me. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3355.66s)]
*  Maybe it's up to them. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3358.66s)]
*  It'll be up to them. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3361.54s)]
*  Some of these I don't understand, but I appreciate people's effort. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3363.3799999999997s)]
*  The stubbornly attached. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3369.2999999999997s)]
*  How do you feel about the stubbornly attached? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3370.2999999999997s)]
*  If only if you tell me a lot, stop listening at two thirds of the way through. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3373.5s)]
*  Be the stubbornly not fully attached. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3377.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3380.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3381.18s)]
*  Unfortunately, also a little difficult to use as a salutation and email dear dear the [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3382.18s)]
*  stubbornly attached. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3385.86s)]
*  It doesn't quite do what we need it to. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3386.86s)]
*  But I appreciate that one. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3388.94s)]
*  Whoever said I like it, though, I like the spirit and that it's not about me. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3390.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think the conversationalists. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3395.7s)]
*  It's a little too general. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3399.46s)]
*  It would apply to too many things. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3400.46s)]
*  I think of the Coppola movie, Gene Hackman. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3402.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3404.82s)]
*  I'll stand for us because we don't actually have conversations. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3406.06s)]
*  This is probably the closest we get to a conversation on CWT. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3408.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3413.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, the list is going to be quite narrowed down since I and I totally agree with this. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3414.94s)]
*  We should not have variants of your name in there. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3420.1400000000003s)]
*  So if you haven't sent in a suggestion already, send it in. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3424.6800000000003s)]
*  We'll narrow it down to a short list and then we'll ask people to vote. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3427.82s)]
*  I think there are some there are some good ones in here. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3432.7s)]
*  All right. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3436.1s)]
*  Last bit of business we need to do before we take our leave for the year is we are currently [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3437.1s)]
*  running our end of year campaign and people can give financially to support the show. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3443.3799999999997s)]
*  One of the incentives we offered was a shout out. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3450.02s)]
*  So if you gave more than two hundred fifty dollars or more to the show, I'm going to [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3452.7s)]
*  give you your shout out and we thank you very much. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3457.46s)]
*  So here's all the folks who gave us who donated to the CWT end of year campaign this year [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3459.7s)]
*  and qualified for this incentive. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3467.14s)]
*  Eric Ward, Chris Masillo, Dave Padula, Carl Moose, Drew Natanchone, Alan Goldhammer, Philip [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3470.54s)]

*  Howard Yeh, Chad Wunderling, Eli Yu. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3498.98s)]
*  Thank you all very, very much for your donations. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3502.86s)]
*  Thank you all as well. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3506.1s)]
*  Truly. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3508.14s)]
*  People have been very generous this year with their donations. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3508.94s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3512.06s)]
*  People who suggest questions. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3513.14s)]
*  They're very valuable. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3515.3s)]
*  So thank you to all of them as well. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3516.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3518.7400000000002s)]
*  And you can email in at any time, reach out to us, reach out to Tyler with guest ideas [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3519.26s)]
*  and your questions. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3525.6200000000003s)]
*  We're happy to receive them. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3527.26s)]
*  Lastly, let me thank some folks from the show. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3529.34s)]
*  And thanks to you, Jeff, for being producer and overseer of all of this among your other [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3533.6600000000003s)]
*  responsibilities. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3538.38s)]
*  It's my favorite thing to do. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3539.38s)]
*  This episode is always my favorite thing to do this year. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3541.1000000000004s)]
*  So it's always a treat and it's great. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3543.82s)]
*  It's very gratifying. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3546.62s)]
*  People now tell me that this is one of their favorite episodes of the year because it gives [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3547.7s)]
*  them a kind of a recommendation for episodes they may have missed among other things. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3552.1s)]
*  So I love doing this. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3557.7s)]
*  I love being here. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3558.98s)]
*  I'm glad I made it. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3559.98s)]
*  There is a sickness everywhere all around us. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3561.2599999999998s)]
*  We're in the studio by ourselves because folks are dropping like flies, but they're not dropping. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3563.2999999999997s)]
*  They're just sidelining. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3569.46s)]
*  They're recumbent on a sofa, you know, hopefully recovering. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3570.94s)]
*  But thanks to your health regimen and mine, evidently, we've made it here today. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3576.3s)]
*  I was in India, so I'm very healthy. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3580.3s)]
*  Dallas and Sam are great. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3582.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm going to thank them in advance. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3584.1400000000003s)]
*  They're great to work with. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3585.86s)]
*  They put up with me. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3586.86s)]
*  Dallas and Sam do most of the work on the show besides Tyler. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3588.86s)]
*  I just get to slide in and do fun things like this. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3593.1000000000004s)]
*  In addition to Dallas and Sam, who produced the show, there's Jen Whistler, Karen Plant, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3597.0600000000004s)]
*  Christina Bihi, Haley Larson, Mary Horan, Ashley Schiller, Serena Dib, and of course, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3601.9s)]
*  there's many others at Mercatus who contributed as well this year. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3607.2200000000003s)]
*  So thank you all very much. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3610.98s)]
*  And when I say like, let's do more, all of you are always game and that's phenomenal. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3612.82s)]
*  It's not that easy to work with people who are like that and who really mean it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3617.62s)]
*  Let's do more. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3623.02s)]
*  And Jeff, let's do more. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3624.02s)]
*  All right. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3625.02s)]
*  Let's do more. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3626.02s)]
*  Let's do more in 2025. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3627.02s)]
*  And if I don't see you listeners before then, I'll see you at the end of 2025 and we'll [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3629.2200000000003s)]
*  see how we did. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3634.02s)]
*  Thank you, Tyler. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3635.02s)]
*  Looking forward to the next year. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3636.02s)]
*  Thank you, Jeff. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3637.3s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3638.3s)]
*  And thank you all for listening to Conversations with Tyler. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3639.3s)]
*  Of all the different things I do in my job, it's the one that means the most to me and [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3643.12s)]
*  the one I enjoy the most. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3647.5s)]
*  Our plan is to continue and do more podcasts, upgrade the series, if we can make them better [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3649.52s)]
*  and have more guests on so I can learn more and so I can talk to more interesting people. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3655.8199999999997s)]
*  Special thanks for all of those of you out there who have supported us financially. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3662.2599999999998s)]
*  Just a reminder that it is not too late to support us still for this calendar year. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3666.62s)]
*  We very much greatly appreciate anything you're able to do. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3671.9399999999996s)]
*  I look forward to seeing you all in future Conversations with Tyler. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg-VwqkpxU&t=3675.7s)]
