Video Description: Few can measure the impact of a blog post they wrote, in the millions of dollars a year, but Patrick McKenzie has the receipts. His 2012 post on salary negotiation is read hundreds of thousands of times each year, and he has a Gmail folder brimming with success stories. This achievement is just of his many contributions, which include starting several businesses, advising Stripe and other software companies, and spearheading the launch of VaccinateCA. Lately he's been writing Bits about Money, a biweekly newsletter on the intersection of tech and finance.

Tyler sat down with Patrick to discuss signature fields on the back of credit cards, whether bank tellers or waitstaff are more trustworthy, the gremlins behind spurious credit card declines, how debt collection and maple syrup heists should change your model of the world, Twitterâ€™s continued success as the message bus for government and civil society, crypto vs traditional money transfers, the intended desolation of bank parking lots, why he moved to Japan and how it affected his ambition, why Tether hasn't collapsed, the internet as a Great Work, how he's experiencing reverse culture shock after returning to the US, what he'll learn about next, and more.

# Patrick McKenzie on Navigating Complex Systems  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAxsoZ36OFI)
*  Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm honored to be talking with Patrick McKinsey.
*  Here is Patrick's own description of himself, and I quote,
*  The broad through-line of my work is systems-thinking applied to businesses.
*  I think the social organization of the Internet and its impact on the world are underestimated
*  by almost everyone, including Silicon Valley.
*  Everything important to you in the world sits atop several infrastructure layers.
*  I am a storyteller for some of those layers and the people who build them.
*  An alternative description of Patrick that I might give you is,
*  He's a guy who moved to Japan for no legible reason at all and became famous by writing
*  on the Internet, and now everyone looks to him as a person who knows a lot about everything.
*  His sub-stack is called Bits About Money, and on Twitter you can find him at Patio11.
*  Many people, in fact, call him Patio11.
*  Patrick, welcome.
*  Thanks very much for having me.
*  Why is it you still have to sign the back of your credit card?
*  So like many answers, the true thing is that is a bit of a misconception.
*  You actually don't have to sign the bit of your credit card in the legal realism sense,
*  in that you can fail to sign the back of your credit card and go throughout your life untroubled
*  by that fact, and most people who do that will be untroubled.
*  The original reason for signing the back of the credit card was rather than authentication
*  or authorization, meaning that the store clerk would thoroughly apply their forensic judgment
*  in determining that the person signing the receipt and the person signing the credit
*  card was the same person.
*  It was about solemnization, that you are making a solemn legally binding promise to the bank
*  when you receive your card that you are good for charges made using that payment instrument,
*  and that was the reason for having the signature field.
*  That is also the reason for having the signature field on credit card receipts, that you are
*  promising to the merchant that you will pay them under the agreement that you have with
*  your bank.
*  Now that everyone understands that when you hand over your credit card that is a binding
*  promise, we don't really have that much social need for that solemnization anymore, and so
*  it is this vestigial feature that is honored in the breach in a lot of places.
*  The vast majority of clerks won't even check signatures these days, which people are sometimes
*  annoyed by.
*  They put on the back of the card, ask to see my ID.
*  That has no legal effect.
*  The clerk is not a forensic investigator, and the clerk also probably has far less knowledge
*  of the credit card infrastructure than you do if you are writing ask to see my ID, although
*  if you are writing ask to see my ID you have a sort of bounded amount of knowledge about
*  the credit card infrastructure.
*  One of these little idiosyncrasies about the world that will probably be somewhat anachronistic
*  in a couple of years.
*  And you are giving them your signature, right, by signing the back of the card.
*  If someone stole it, they now have your card and your signature.
*  Yeah, a lot of what we would call pre-modern thinking about security in terms of payments
*  was not, I won't say not all that well thought out.
*  There are choices that were made back then that were good in the era they were made that
*  are disastrously bad right now.
*  For example, if I had let's say a bank account and I have a secret controlling that bank
*  account and that secret would allow me to take all of the money out of that bank account,
*  you might think, how should I protect this secret?
*  And the answer you would come up in 2023 is not.
*  I want to print it in machine readable type on every check that I give to everyone.
*  But in fact, that is what we did back in the day.
*  And many, many tens of billions of dollars of check fraud happened over the years because
*  of that issue.
*  And we sort of just took the punches and developed a vast shadow infrastructure to defang this
*  irreducible security hole in the heart of the checking system.
*  So yeah, putting your signatures that like the handwritten physical signature as very
*  terrible security properties, anyone who has seen it can reproduce it.
*  They are very easily reproducible by computers.
*  They are less easily reproducible by humans.
*  Checking them for correctness or consistency is terrible.
*  The forensic analysts who go to court and try to compare signatures against each other.
*  If I were to say they were practicing witchcraft, I think that would be an uncouth thing to
*  say.
*  I don't think it is necessarily untrue.
*  And so not a technology we would use in 2023 and going forward to secure anything that
*  we actually care about.
*  Whom do you trust more, your bank teller or the waitress to whom you hand your credit
*  card?
*  A bank teller by a country mile, although it is ultimately irrelevant.
*  So the reason to trust your bank teller versus your waitress is that while those appear in,
*  say, the United States context to be like jobs that are relatively similar on the social
*  ladder, they in fact are not.
*  And for all of the reasons that correlate with class, et cetera, et cetera, and whether
*  someone is likely to engage in malfeasance and also the built environment around bank
*  tellers versus waitresses, you are far less likely to get taken advantage of than a bank
*  teller than a waitress.
*  But it is ultimately irrelevant because in the case you are taken advantage of by either
*  a bank teller or a waitress, we have an extremely effective public-private regulatory state
*  machine which will make you whole for that.
*  And so it will be annoying, but you won't actually lose money.
*  And so I go through my life spending very few cycles worried about either individuals
*  in the financial industry or individuals in the restaurant industry taking advantage of
*  my payment methods.
*  If I try to use my credit card and it's a false decline, that is, they won't take it
*  when they should.
*  What's the most likely reason for that?
*  Gremlins.
*  And it sounds like a joke, but serious people.
*  So I used to work in the payments industry as Stripe and I'm still an advisor there and
*  say that everything I say is in my own opinions and Stripe as a corporation does not actually
*  endorse the existence of fiscal gremlins.
*  I'm not sure I don't.
*  Many people in the payments industry have spent a lot of time looking at the true source
*  of false declines and eventually the best you can do is reduce it to some sort of error
*  term where you don't know specifically what system is at fault.
*  The credit card ecosystem might present to you as a single pane of glass they interact
*  with just like you interact with a single pane of glass on your iPhone is actually a
*  stitched together patchwork collections of systems that have existed for the last several
*  decades.
*  Somewhere in that stitched together patchwork, someone had a hiccup and then your credit
*  card gets what we call a spurious decline.
*  The rate of spurious declines is something of a trade secret, but it is much higher than
*  any rational human being would expect is a tolerable rate of spurious false activity within
*  a system.
*  That has persisted for so many decades as an interesting sort of collective action problem
*  because it's a stitched together patchwork of systems.
*  There's no unitary authority saying you must commit to decreasing your rate of false declines
*  by 50 basis points within the next two quarters or there will be consequences.
*  There is limited visibility into what is actually causing the problem.
*  So, credit cards are an enormously lucrative business.
*  For the longest time all players were like, yeah, gremlins, I don't know what to tell
*  you.
*  So, I know a little bit more to tell you than gremlins, but unfortunately some of it is
*  trade secrets.
*  A thing that is not exactly a trade secret is that it is not the fact that, in fact,
*  the case that problems are not solvable in the world, you actually can move the false
*  decline rate by having the right people in the right places actually work on the false
*  decline rate.
*  The paper has a number of things.
*  You can read it from various PR announcements.
*  And somewhat shockingly, long-standing multi-decade problems frequently have the rough form where
*  if one executive anywhere cared about this and did the bare minimum of effort, you would
*  have somewhat surprising results on them relatively quickly.
*  The thing that most surprised me on that score outside of the payments industry was when
*  I had this long-running assumption that we're doing about as good as we can with rockets.
*  The laws of physics are a thing.
*  We've dumped billions of dollars into this problem and the smartest literal rocket scientists
*  in the world at it.
*  And then Elon Musk came around and said, actually, I think we can cheat the costs of getting
*  things up to orbit by three orders of magnitude.
*  And then if you had told me that in 1990, I would have been very young to opine about
*  the cost of the rocket.
*  If you had said that was possible in 2005, I'd say I bet against that seems like a priori,
*  extremely unlikely to happen.
*  And now we have an existence proof of it happening.
*  And I'm reevaluating what I think about the world and how tractable various problems are
*  in it.
*  If I buy a gelato for $7, they make me sign with my finger on the screen.
*  And all I do is run my finger on the screen.
*  And it has nothing to do with my signature.
*  Why doesn't the Coase theorem eliminate this practice?
*  Can you refresh my memory what the Coase theorem is?
*  Well, just gains from trade are reaped.
*  People don't do pointless things that benefit no one.
*  They would agree to take my payment without running my finger on the screen and I wouldn't
*  run my finger on the screen.
*  So ultimately, that comes down to a choice of various firms involved in the interaction.
*  It is the case that you can make a lot of credit card payments without doing any finger
*  on the screen or signing receipt.
*  Small dollar, small yen transactions in Japan, for example.
*  There are various POS systems, point of sale systems in the United States that won't ask
*  you to sign it.
*  If you're asking to rationalize this on, you know, why does a smart team like I assume
*  exist at Toast make a signature input thing anyway?
*  There are anchors in our social practice about doing things.
*  Sometimes things persist in those anchors for far longer than they're actually required
*  or produce any sort of value.
*  That would be my dominant hypothesis.
*  But I also think it is probably the case that Toast could build a flag to turn that off
*  tomorrow.
*  Many people would not choose to turn it off for basically rational reasons.
*  In a country of near full employment, why would anyone work in the debt collection sector?
*  It's ugly work.
*  You feel bad.
*  You have to abuse people.
*  Maybe you try to intimidate them.
*  You might even make implied threats that if not illegal, they're in some gray area.
*  Why do it?
*  Is the wage so high?
*  So the wage is certainly not so high.
*  As background information for people, I used to work in the other side of debt collection.
*  I was this random internet nobody that goes writing letters to debt collectors to attempt
*  to get low sophistication individuals to assert their rights under various U.S. consumer legislation.
*  The typical debt collector is a high school graduate.
*  They make plus or minus $15 an hour, perhaps that has shifted a little bit as inflation
*  has it the last couple of years.
*  But broadly speaking, it's that.
*  You have a pay scale that is not too different from McDonald's for a much, much worse working
*  environment, et cetera, et cetera.
*  One reason, and I think this is over advanced in the world, but is partially explanatory
*  in this case, is that the existence of, I'm about to use the word evil on that.
*  I don't want to use the word evil.
*  We're allowed to use the word evil on this podcast.
*  The existence of evil is an actual thing in the world, and our models of the world must
*  include evil to be accurate models of the world.
*  There are some people who enjoy inflicting suffering on others.
*  And if you enjoy inflicting suffering, a debt collection is a wonderful gig for you.
*  Some people who enjoy inflicting suffering go into the police, for example.
*  It's not the fact that all members of the police enjoy inflicting suffering, but that
*  a major source of utility for at least some people who get that job.
*  Another thing for debt collection is that in the places where debt collectors actually
*  live, the economy as a whole can be near full employment, but in rural New York, that might
*  not be great.
*  It might not be quite so full employment.
*  And for office jobs that are available, a debt collection call center or a more salubrious
*  call center might be the only office job available.
*  So relative to the choices that are actually presented to you, that might be the most rational
*  thing even if you hate the environment and turn out in your...
*  And indeed, the turnover rate for debt collectors is astounding.
*  It's on the order of...
*  Oh, I hate making up numbers.
*  This sounds like I know what I'm doing.
*  It is higher than it is for fast food restaurants, which is already close to 100% a year, meaning
*  in the expectation they expect to turn over the typical employee in less than a year.
*  And you think they leave because they don't like it or they leave because they're bad
*  at it and they're fired?
*  Overwhelmingly they leave because they don't like it.
*  There is a production function for debt collectors in a way that there is far less of a production
*  function for McDonald's employees.
*  Certainly there are ways to be a bad McDonald's employee, but considering just the, are you
*  physically capable of making a burger or not?
*  Almost everyone who McDonald's hires is actually physically capable of making a burger.
*  There's probably at least an order of magnitude difference, perhaps more in terms of productivity
*  of the amount of dollars collected per hour by debt collectors.
*  And so it is possible to be a negative productive debt collector.
*  And since your activity is tracked, your employer will eventually come to understand about you.
*  But most people who leave don't leave because this is a job that is beyond their intellectual
*  capability or because the script they are given doesn't work or et cetera, et cetera.
*  They leave because the job is soul destroying.
*  How did the maple syrup heists change your overall view of the world and of humanity?
*  What's the model update?
*  So going back to evil is an actual thing in the world.
*  I often assume that large, well-regarded, professionalized industries have a rate of
*  crime associated with them that rounds to zero.
*  And so I would assume like, okay, agriculture is relatively heavily regulated.
*  Maple syrup is an agricultural product.
*  And the only buyers of maple syrup by the container full are, quote unquote, real companies.
*  And therefore, I would expect rounds to zero supply chain fraud in maple syrup.
*  And it turns out that the amount of supply chain fraud in maple syrup is actually like
*  quite higher than zero.
*  And the chain of custody for cars of maple syrup is much less regimented than you would
*  expect that chain of custody to be.
*  And there are smaller buyers of maple syrup, not on the scale of you or me, but on the
*  scale of a petite maple syrup refinery who just don't do as many checks as the large
*  producers or suppliers, et cetera, do.
*  And so it is possible to steal millions of dollars of maple syrup and sell it on the
*  black market, which kind of blew my mind.
*  And this sort of rhymes with how Tide, the well-known detergent in the United States,
*  is used as a commodity on the criminal and semi-criminal, system D, less criminal, undergrounds.
*  In that Tide can be resold.
*  Online marketplaces are getting a lot of the attention.
*  The traditional way to use Tide as a currency for people who have less access to dollars
*  was to resell the Tide to a corner bodega.
*  And since the corner bodega can easily verify that the Tide hasn't been tampered with because
*  the Tide seals on it and has basically unlimited willingness to do small dollar transactions
*  that make money, that was a way to recycle Tide which had been stolen or which had been
*  acquired in means that were not stealing but also not exactly the official way of getting
*  Tide and recycle it into the more or less legitimate economy insofar as we think that
*  the corner bodega is more or less legitimate, which I think is a complicated story.
*  Do you ever encounter sectors where there's less fraud than what you had been expecting?
*  Or is there just more evil all around and you were naive and now you're wiser?
*  So I broadly think people overpredict evil and underpredict competence and then I thought
*  I was sophisticated for believing this and then got to my adult life and realized, oh
*  wait, you know, evil actually exists, I need to increase my prediction but maybe not to
*  the level that society generally predicts it.
*  Places where there is much less fraud than I expected.
*  One place where we detect much less fraud than I would expect us to detect is in insider
*  trading and other forms of obviously illegal market manipulation and I'm undecided on whether
*  that is truly, truly rare relative to the size of all market participation or we are
*  just abominably glad at detecting people that do it with like a B plus student level of
*  execution ability because when the SEC announces like, hey, we got this person for insider
*  trading, here is the evidence, they did it on their work computer at Goldman Sachs after
*  Googling how do I get away with insider trading on their work computer at Goldman Sachs and
*  that is barely an exaggeration, by the way.
*  And then they left a huge paper trail and this repeats in all the SEC press releases
*  and so I'm wondering, am I getting a biased look at the world or are we only detecting
*  the dumbest possible criminals or is it that no one does insider trading after they achieve
*  some level of competence because there are easier ways to make money that don't involve
*  going to prison.
*  For a while, and continuing, I thought that crypto was sort of drawing a lot of the fraud
*  out of the more traditional sectors of the economy because if you do it in crypto, it
*  wasn't fraud, it was fraud that you would get away with and make a substantial amount
*  of money doing and you could do it in broad daylight and still get invited to the best
*  parties but I don't think that is fully explanatory and my model is that there should be much,
*  much more fraud happening in the legitimate parts of the economy than there is in crypto
*  and yet we can see like the obvious frauds in crypto and the investigation of those obvious
*  frauds and we don't have nearly that level of visibility into it and the real economy
*  and so I continue to be conflicted by this.
*  As we're speaking in October 2023, Elon Musk has suggested that he will take X, formerly
*  Twitter, and turn it into some kind of universal payments app.
*  What's the chance he can succeed with this and if you're bearish on it, what's the fundamental
*  problem?
*  If he hypothetically does that, he will likely hypothetically be attempting to
*  commercial negotiations with a company that I previously worked for and so I'm absolutely
*  not speaking for them in the following.
*  As a neutral market observer, it seems extremely unlikely that you will successfully embed
*  payments into the Twitter experience, the X experience these days.
*  I feel journalists feel some sort of obligation to call it X now that the official name is X.
*  Twitter will always be Twitter for me so I'll call it Twitter.
*  The thing that users expect to get out of Twitter doesn't involve payments, doesn't
*  typically involve interaction with businesses or even generally with individuals that are on a
*  repeated interactive basis.
*  They get an entirely different basket of goods out of it and simply grafting payments onto that
*  basket of goods will not make people adopt the payments.
*  I understand from a product management perspective how you could believe that that would be
*  fantastically valuable if you got it to work because the super apps that exist in large
*  portions of Asia are fantastically valuable businesses and they have figured out loops that
*  get users to adopt it for one feature and then adopt all the other features because it's already
*  on your phone and the business dev to get it reinstalled on all the phones and etc.
*  This is much harder than that gloss I've just given you.
*  The fundamental reason why I'm extremely bearish on it happening for Twitter and I would put the
*  percentage that's below 1%, far below 1% is that this is very, very hard and it feels unlikely to
*  me that the organization that is Twitter is resourced or competent enough to make this happen
*  which I will say I'm an enormous fan of Twitter.
*  I think it is actually one of the, descriptively one of the most important products that exists on
*  the internet because it has not solved but ameliorated a lot of cross-organization
*  coordination problems that happen in very important places.
*  It is broadly underappreciated how Twitter is the message bus, the sort of sub rosa
*  coordination mechanism for the United States federal government, for every counterparty
*  that the United States federal government or any agency or individual faces for the media,
*  for everything and so people like see Twitter and they see celebrities posting and
*  the phenomenon that is shit posting and etc. etc. and to a very real degree it is like an integrated
*  part of the operating system that is the world but that doesn't mean that you can graft famous
*  onto it and succeed just because you want to.
*  If I go to Western Union and send money to Mexico, why are the fees and transfer costs so high?
*  It doesn't seem like it should be that hard.
*  So this is an enormously frustrating thing for me because the crypto industry has been saying why
*  are Western Union fees so high and yet very few people in the crypto industry seem to do like
*  the college undergraduate level thing that one would do to answer that question which is why
*  don't you read their annual reports and see what they spend all the money on.
*  What they spend all the money on is retail points of presence by the customer in both countries.
*  So 50% of all revenue taken in by Western Union goes to have a physical point of presence
*  by you sending it and by without loss of generality AblalÃ¡ and Mexico.
*  Do those have to exist? Could you do them cheaper? You might be able to but the problem
*  such as this is like most of the cost or most of the complexity is by AblalÃ¡ and Mexico and
*  there's not one single like AblalÃ¡ and Mexico where you just replace this one branch.
*  You have to coordinate this worldwide change in behaviors to like materially compress that fee
*  and so that is why the fees are so high.
*  Another reason why the fees are so high is regulation and this one is
*  we as a society could choose to do things better and have not chosen these apps and
*  but I wish we would. Due to anti-money laundering and know your customer requirements
*  the amount of compliance drag on small transfers of value in the world is very very large.
*  The rationale for it such that there exists a rationale is that well if you can do small
*  transfers of value easily without proving your identity then you could do large transfers of
*  value by breaking it up into small transfers of value that are unsurveilled and then that would
*  enable crime and terrorism and tax evasion and so even if you're sending typical transfer might be
*  $200 to Mexico you have to go through this song and dance about proving your identity to the
*  transfer agent they have to regulate it yada yada yada and that entire edifice imposes a lot of
*  costs and a lot of things that are undesirable from user experience perspective and both in
*  terms of like people will tell you that they don't enjoy them and in terms of if you were to you know
*  implement two parallel procedures the one that didn't require that level of regulatory hoop
*  jumping would have a higher success rate by equally motivated people. So this is one so I'm a
*  long time crypto skeptic and one of the things that I think I see eye to eye on with the crypto
*  folks is that you know AML and KYC impose enormous costs on society then where we differ is they
*  think oh I will make a technological solution to this and just ignore all the laws and I think
*  well to the extent that we believe this is true we should probably work on changing the laws and
*  regulations and and or changing how we implement them in products that are actually valuable.
*  Why are bank parking lots usually so empty?
*  Oh so this is a straightforward result from queuing theory if you can believe it.
*  So queuing theory slash operation silence by the way tremendously under understood by
*  many people to whom it is professionally relevant. Give that as a so when you think of your typical
*  stop it in a bank you go in perhaps you deposit a check perhaps you talk to the teller
*  you probably think I will have like three minutes of dwell time and so you expect to be in and out
*  but the thing that the bank really wants to optimize for is new account opening. New account
*  opening requires 30 to 60 minutes plus plus of dwell time depending on what type of account you
*  are opening and then when you like back out that variability it turns out that gratuitously
*  over provisioning the parking space almost all the time maximizes for not losing new account
*  opening at a few like very limited windows per year and those very limited windows can make or
*  break the the branch's ability to contribute to their larger financial institution. The number
*  of accounts at bank actually opens per year in terms of checking accounts per branch is like that
*  is a number that one can have access to in various places and depending on the bank and the locality
*  etc it's between 200 and 500 and so if you turn away like a single customer or two customers in a
*  row to open accounts because you had three parking spaces where you could have had seven
*  you've done a very outsized amount of damage to your financial institution and thus over provision
*  the parking in all the places. So I should infer that I shouldn't keep much money in my checking
*  account that's a correct inference from that the margin for the bank must be fairly high
*  which means my return all things considered is relatively low. So I don't think you even need
*  any inside knowledge about banks to know that one should not keep much money in a checking account
*  or a CD or anything what might do with the bank. To ask you the Willie Sutton question
*  why do people try to rob banks? It seems like a low return activity the form of crime where
*  you're most likely to be caught. It largely is a low return activity and the FBI is
*  so they published that some of this and the median haul that a bank robber gets is about $8,000
*  and it is the worst possible way to earn $8,000 because a career bank thief the other word for
*  that is long-term guest of the United States government. It is impossible to get away with
*  over an extended period of time. Not to give people advice on becoming criminals but
*  if one wanted to describe like a criminal that was using their faculties to the best of their
*  abilities. Credit card fraud is so amazingly more lucrative than robbing banks. You can do it
*  without ever threatening anyone. You can do it with only about as much sophistication about
*  how the system works as the typical bank thief has and indeed you do see like casual fraud by
*  unsophisticated let's say non-professional criminals, high school students etc. who
*  earn or gain access to value through that casual fraud much more than they would if they stuck up
*  a bank and therefore the people that actually do stick up banks are overwhelmingly drug addicted,
*  they're disproportionately struggling with mental illness etc. It is not that big of a risk. That
*  that big risk that by the way is also a reason why banks, part of a few reasons,
*  why banks are not optimized to defeat people during bank robbery which is surprising to
*  many non-specialists. If you join a bank one of the first things they say is in the event of a
*  bank robbery don't be a hero. This does not matter to us at all. Comply with all demands, get them
*  out of the bank as quickly as possible, do not fight, do not chase etc. etc. Partly that is due
*  to the liability risk. The way the US system views these things, the net present value of
*  a young bank employee is worth a lot more than $8,000 and if they get shot on their way out the
*  door the bank might be liable for millions of dollars of settlement to that individual whereas
*  if the person walks away with $8,000 yay. But the other part of it is that the banks truly aren't
*  at risk from losing cash in robberies.
*  LW How old were you when you moved to Japan and why did you do it?
*  BG Move to Japan almost right after university so I suppose I would have been 20 and
*  the original reason, I wish I had a copy of this article I should post it on my wall somewhere.
*  I had gone to Washington University in St. Louis to study computer science and I was worried
*  because the Wall Street Journal said the dot-com bust means that engineering employment will cease
*  in the United States of America. All future engineers will be hired in China or India at a
*  fraction of US prevailing wages. I thought oh shucks the Wall Street Journal is never wrong
*  but I really wanted to be an engineer. Clearly the successful engineers in the future will be
*  playing a Venn diagram game where they do one hard thing that is engineering and one hard thing that
*  is speaking a foreign language. I thought speaking foreign language is hard because it's the only
*  class in high school that I did not get an A in for showing up, Spanish. But I thought well there's
*  very little advantage for an American in my position to speak Spanish because there are many
*  Americans who speak Spanish better than I ever will and the amount of trade in software between
*  the United States and Spanish-speaking countries is presumably lower than it is with other countries.
*  So I made a spreadsheet and trying to quantify things like what's the population of the country,
*  what percentage of their professional adults are capable of doing business English,
*  what's the size of their software industry, how much software does Microsoft sell there etc. etc.
*  Do do do. Sort by column H descending and Japan is at the top of the list. So I thought okay I'm
*  going to learn Japanese and then I'm going to go to Japan after university for just a few years
*  to get better at business Japanese. Then I'm going to come back to America, get a job at Microsoft
*  in a Japan-facing role and I will have a nice safe job in the tech industry despite what the
*  the Wall Street Journal says about the tech industry ceasing to hire Americans for the
*  positions that I actually want to do. And it turns out that there was a great deal of rigor there
*  chasing a conclusion that had actually absolutely no basis in fact. It is not the case that the tech
*  industry stopped hiring Americans in the last 20 years but it also led to what was ultimately
*  one of the most important decisions in my life. I went over to Japan, I lived there for 20 happy
*  asterisk years, met my wife over there etc. etc. So I often mention this to people as an example of
*  you can have great reasons for doing something and have that utterly not matter. And also
*  I tried to tell sophisticated people that other people who they have a high degree of regard for,
*  some sophisticated people for whatever reason have a high degree of regard for me.
*  Even people you have a high degree of regard for sometimes make very large decisions based on
*  very small amounts of data or like very small amounts of consideration with regards to that
*  decision and therefore you should update your world model about that and like you know be very
*  careful about saying things like oh the tech industry is so over haha as a joke because like
*  it is quite possible that someone who would listen to that and just perceive the surface level
*  meaning of it and then the tech industry would lose the services of someone who
*  in expectation of life very much want to have had the services of in 20 years.
*  How hard was it learning how to read Japanese?
*  It continues to be a project. And this is after 20 years right? Yep. So granted my feelings on this
*  are partly filtered through the lens of I'm something of a writer in English and so I'm
*  not benchmarking myself against the typical students of the Japanese language but I'm
*  benchmarking myself against my own proficiency in reading and writing English and so I feel an
*  enormous gap when my proficiency in reading writing Japanese relative to my proficiency in English
*  and that weighs on me. If you step out of the me view of the world the point at which I was
*  an effective professional at reading and writing Japanese was maybe two to three years after I got
*  Japan so after a total of six years of study and I was not the most diligent student during those
*  six years. I think if you're not a heritage reader of Japanese or Chinese you should
*  like benchmark it at least three years to be you know professionally capable at it.
*  If you're doing a startup how was that evaluated in the Japanese marriage market?
*  Extremely poorly historically. Both in the United States and in Japan one of the most
*  influential works of fiction ever is the social network and I bang the drum on this a lot that
*  the social network raised the status of entrepreneurship for proto-entrepreneurs
*  worldwide and thus we can see it in the data there was a there was a wave of applications
*  to places like mycombinator that will disclose that data but also like see it in the actual
*  narratives of people who went on to found companies that became worthwhile. Unfortunately that gets
*  expunged out of the public narrative because you don't want to tell you know serious people oh yeah
*  I totally started doing a startup versus going to Google because you know the social network
*  gave me social permissions to do so but that is a real fun. Anyhow to Japan in the I was once
*  walking around Tokyo and there was a group of preschoolers being led around by their
*  their caretaker and one of them asked me in Japanese hey mister what's your job this is
*  at about 10 30 in the morning for context and I said I am an entrepreneur and preschooler mind
*  you said which means just as I thought he is unemployed and that is like the form of two
*  perfect anecdote to encapsulate a broader society was like guys with respect to
*  entrepreneurship and and make many things about Japan this gets you know there's all sorts of
*  like asterisks as you can put on that too like Japan loves entrepreneurs in the same fashion
*  that like Catholicism loves saints but they all happened a while ago the and you know these are
*  things that are in the that are changing over time etc etc but broadly speaking
*  entrepreneurs are extremely undervalued in the Japanese dating market.
*  You once cited the following idea on your blog and I quote most people want to become wealthy
*  so they can consume social status Japanese employers believe this is inefficient and simply
*  award social status directly that's not you writing but it's you citing can you explain?
*  Sure so people in the professional managerial class devote an extreme amount of care into their
*  career and time and so by their revealed preferences this matters to them exceptionally
*  and in the United States it's often said that this is because we want to you know earn a lot
*  of money and buy like the big house so you can bring your friends over to the big house and
*  show them that you're successful and so you have indicia of respected institutions endorsing you
*  which is that the sort of like more gets it feel the world. The analogs of the U.S. professional
*  managerial class in Japan are similarly overworked treated even more terribly to a
*  substantial degree like there is an ingrained culture of abuse in Japanese labor slash employer
*  relations where that culture there are parts of it in the United States but not to nearly the same
*  degree. Now the thing that you are trying to do if you are a salaryman is not to get the promotions
*  so that you earn more money because you will not earn appreciably more money and indeed you
*  will not earn appreciably more money than the false course of just taking social promotions
*  through your entire life. The thing you are trying to do is get higher both true and sounds too
*  too good to be true and there was a chart of engineers at the company that I worked at
*  the day when I was a salaryman and there was a young man I'll call him Tanaka-san which is not
*  his actual name and Tanaka-san had a couple weeks of seniority versus me in my role at the company
*  and so in the default ordering of the social hierarchy at a Japanese company he would be
*  above me on this chart that is pasted on the wall and it's pasted on the wall for an actual business
*  purpose because you know if someone's out of the office that day you write they are absent or they
*  are at a customer site or etc etc but the order matters everyone knows the order matters and one
*  day I watched two young O.L.'s office ladies the coinage in Japan going up to the chart and they
*  they had Tanaka-san's name in one hand and my name in the other hand and one of them asked the other
*  which of these goes first and the first one said well Tanaka-san has seniority it should be him
*  and the second one said yeah but Tanaka-san really screwed the pooch on that last project
*  and the second and the other one said oh yeah good point and there was like a literal like
*  business like moving hands up and down and a significant glance between each other and said
*  yes that is the correct ordering with Patrick Cantop versus Tanaka-san and tiny little anecdote
*  that shows much more about the shape of the world a huge amount of the effort involved in
*  the culture that is Japanese Sailor Man is convincing the people that matter to you who
*  are most of your social network at work who will be there at your wedding who your boss will give
*  a speech at your wedding because that is the culture that we operate in that you have made it
*  if you are you know ambitious etc etc etc there are people who decline to participate in this
*  in the same fashion as people decline to participate in the United States but
*  that is the broad accepted outline of the culture.
*  And how is it that your ambitions grow steadily in this environment you weren't beaten down
*  you weren't discouraged you didn't just fly home either right but you kept on setting your sights
*  on something higher what was that like inside you? Interestingly from having the perspective of being
*  around people who are incredibly ambitious the last couple years and whose ambitions had
*  positive social purpose one of the great results great regrets of my life is that in my 20s I had
*  so little ambition and was so beaten down and didn't take more aggressive actions to exit out
*  the situation I found myself in. I remember so after I quit the Sailor Man job which by the way
*  Sailor Man is full-time employee of a Japanese company the company owns you body and soul and
*  return it credibly promises to at least historically credibly promises you to insulate
*  you from all risk. I worked at jobs that are described that for about six years burned out
*  terribly made a socially appropriate excuse to quit which is the one thing that you as a
*  Sailor Man are not allowed to do and I remember April 1st 2010 thinking I could get out of
*  plane right now with nothing but clothes on my back close the Japanese chapter of my life entirely
*  and walk into Jeff Lawson's office in San Francisco who was the CEO of Twilio he doesn't know me but
*  I think after walking into his office I can beg borrow or steal the job there and just do something
*  much more impactful important personally fulfilling etc over the next couple of years the thing that
*  I've been doing the last couple of years but I'm not willing to like call it quits on this Japan
*  adventure yet I do enjoy living here working here is terrible I will try to you know carve out a
*  little some some some bits of living from my tiny internet software publishing operation that I was
*  running at the time and and see what happens and then indeed the thing that happened three months
*  later is that that met the young lady who eventually became my wife and so we were off to the races
*  but you know there are other hypostatic wasn't it efficient in some regards that you had so many
*  years out there in the wilderness so to speak because you learned so many things you're still
*  young right you have a whole big long career ahead of you and by avoiding becoming famous too early
*  you had this super hyped up learning curve that you're now still benefiting from is that true or
*  false I wanted to be true I I think that it is
*  falser than most people who would say that would give credit for and
*  I know many people liked the musical Hamilton I also like the musical Hamilton but that the
*  thing about the character where he feels like he's running out of time despite that maybe not being
*  rational is a struggle I've often had and I know rationally speaking I have at least 20 plus years
*  in my my career left and also know that you know there there is a level of energy and health that
*  I had access to in my 20s that I no longer have access to and so I feel some counterfactual regret
*  as to the things that I actually spent that energy and health on which was you know running the world
*  of Warcraft Free Guild and being a Japanese salaryman for many years I did not think that
*  six years as Japanese salaryman optimized for me learning all things I think I could have
*  extracted most of the signal from that experience and six weeks to six months and then left but
*  felt myself socially constrained from doing so there's I definitely don't regret moving to Japan
*  because of the you know other non-professional knock-out effects on my life but the the degree
*  to which my you know career slash impact on the world of ex-personal life ex-family ex-raising
*  two wonderful children and being married to a wonderful life and the degree to which that is
*  enhanced by you know my level of understanding of business Japanese or ability to function in a
*  Japanese office environment etc etc seems to be like rather limited versus you know my ability to
*  write well in English and I will say one thing about the experience is that having a lot of
*  free time on your hands in the in the evenings and no outlet for English was a great push in
*  the right direction of writing more than most people do in their 20s and the the compounding
*  effects of writing more are responsible for both a lot of the good stuff that has happened to me
*  and a lot of the good stuff that I've been able to accomplish in the world so crypto questions
*  yeah why why hasn't tether collapsed yet right people have run at it many times not too long
*  ago I think the price fell even to 93 which is dangerously low it bounced back it seems
*  they can always redeem what if it isn't a fraud
*  fraud
*  I pre-commit that if it is not a fraud I should have enormous egg on my face on the other hand
*  like we you know there exists sufficient evidence on the public record in the CFTC case and etc that
*  at times in the past it has been an out-and-out fraud that had you know essentially no backing
*  and that they had done forensic accounting on it and for their examination period was about 18
*  months and said that it was less than less than backed in more than 75 days in the examination
*  period and so like from one sense I can claim victory you know it's a it's a fraud I was saying
*  it was fraud before it was cool that the government now acknowledges that they did fraud things at
*  some points fast but I think it should also collapse like it is not just a you know tinkering
*  around the margins fraud but there is actual a huge amount of actual criminal activity there
*  one sort of the naive answer is like do we expect frauds to collapse quickly probably no
*  Madoff was active for 17 or 18 years and the only thing that actually brought his fraud to light
*  well various kind of senti knew about it the thing that made it undeniable was being unable to meet
*  redemption requests in the wake of the global financial crisis and Madoff importantly did not
*  cause the global financial crisis of all the crimes in the world he was innocent of that one
*  but people said Ernie you have all this money for me you alone among all the people I invest my
*  money with have avoided this crisis which is great because now I need money can you wire it to me
*  and he did not have the money to wire and that's how his his crimes came to life so to a certain
*  extent it not collapsing is like you know the thing that we expect to happen on every day until
*  it collapses catastrophically and the thing that we would expect the collapse to happen with is
*  my dominant narrative is like some form of government action against their reserves that
*  are custodied in some financial institution in New York followed by the public
*  the public disclosure of that action which might not be a total freeze but enough to start the
*  domino and then a classic run on the bank and then you know the the pipes get overwhelmed yada yada yada
*  and price goes down substantially below 93 in a famous interview on Bloomberg
*  Tether's character witness one Sam Bankman Fried said that he believes that
*  is astoundingly unlikely that Tether is worth in true sense like 30 but you could quibble us
*  back to whether it's worth like 99 cents or a dollar and a penny
*  and I think there is a material chance it is like truly worth something like 30
*  potentially negative after you you know add government fines and other actions on so I
*  continue to expect that to happen circa late October 2023 bitcoin is priced as high as 33k
*  why is that surely it's good for many things then right
*  it's been through a lot of price knocks right it's not a bubble in the sense that no one has ever
*  asked why is the price so high it's been crushed what five six times since its origin and it keeps
*  on coming back is it a proven asset class
*  some things have a price and have liquidity at the moment and you can trade them and you can
*  trade them and that on one hand that is evidence right and on the other hand that is not
*  necessarily dispositive and so I feel intellectually obligated to say I'm saying that bitcoin is
*  overpriced at 17 dollars I still like believe that to be true in a lot of senses meaning if
*  counterfactually it was 17 dollars today I'm saying it was overpriced at 17
*  do I believe it is overpriced at 33k relative to like the amount of actual utility that's
*  demonstrated in the world and the tens of billions of dollars that have been injected into
*  creating infrastructure for it absolutely yes but like some sense of epistemic humility
*  you know we have been watching that ticker for over a decade now and the ticker and you know
*  market participants keep voting against my view and question why is it because of manipulation
*  surely yes but that is not a full explanation and you know is it because of like some amount
*  of utility I think the amount of realized utility by bitcoin and you know I'm a great crypto
*  skeptic but if you were to say okay hold your nose for a moment and and steal man the case
*  for crypto utility tell me about your favorite projects etc I would point out a lot of things
*  that weren't bitcoin but you know involve some sort of like intellectual descent in my community
*  crossover with bitcoin but like bitcoin as itself is clearly not the best product the crypto has
*  come up with and and yet you know the market says it is by like a comfortable margin the most
*  valuable product that crypto has come up with and I I don't know how to square that circle
*  and a hundred years from now if we were all to look back as historians and say oh the internet
*  that was in fact a big mistake what's the most likely scenario that could bring about such a judgment
*  I do not have a super developed point of view with respect to the like whether AI is going
*  to end the world I think relative to most well educated people and I think that can't be
*  dismissed out of hand people who spent a long time thinking about it have spent a long time
*  thinking about it and the the arguments advanced against them by people who dismiss it out of hand
*  are like clearly less than powerful arguments and but I wouldn't put in very high percentage
*  percentage chance of it which I say to excuse the following if the human race does not exist
*  in a hundred years it is almost definitionally because of the event the some knock-on consequence
*  of the invention of the internet and if the human race ceases to exist and the internet like was
*  necessary in the causal path to get to there then I would regret the internet in every other case
*  I would not regret the internet I I
*  I have an ebullience and love for it in a way that people in our social class in the United States
*  are aggressively socialized out of having ebullience and true love for anything I think
*  that the internet it is the capital G capital W great work of the human race in a lot of respects
*  that yeah it is magical it is a
*  encapsulation of the best things about our society that is also tremendously instrumentally useful
*  in making all the good things better and ameliorating all the problems over like
*  sufficiently long time scales and so you know it seems like naturally to me that like this is
*  extremely important this is extremely valuable and seems extremely underrated by almost everyone
*  including people who like would consider themselves you know great fans of the internet but say oh
*  you know like I'm a great fan of the internet but I'm a great fan of like penicillin too I think
*  like in aggregate internet the internet is obviously more important than penicillin by
*  many orders of magnitude is it more important than medicine I will bite that bullet the internet is
*  more important than medicine like the entire institution of medicine from time immemorial to
*  you know reasonable like extrapolations of what we can do right now and is it more important than
*  writing you couldn't have the internet without writing so writing was very important to get to
*  development at the internet that might be one of the most important things about writing was that
*  like writing got us to the internet and that sounds like a little bit of I know people will
*  take that pull quote and say oh this this crazy non-intellectual person but I think that there is
*  a reasonable case for it when you ran vaccinate ca which helped people in California get access
*  to covid vaccines what is it you learned about talent what is it I learned about talent yeah
*  because you had to run it with other people right what did you learn dealing with the people
*  getting them to cooperate with you what was the surprise it was a lot of non-traditional talent
*  right it was a lot of non-traditional talent the word learn is funny because it it uh you know
*  there's some embedded expectation of surprise like you didn't know something and then you you
*  came to know something there's a thing that I would have put a high probability on prior to
*  vaccinate ca that vaccinated increased my credence on which is that relative to credentialed
*  talenting institutions like you know throw a dart as the dark board about it let's say
*  county health departments for example and they're heavily educated in their field they are
*  credentialed there's a democratic process that ultimately backstops the decision of county health
*  department j rando person on the internet can maybe be better at like important phases of pandemic
*  preparedness given two to six weeks versus a like county health department that is prepared for
*  exactly this problem for their entire professional career yes straightforwardly yes and and that is
*  the thing I would have believed in you know 2018 but now I have an existence proof of
*  now the work of county health departments continues to be important etc etc I do want to
*  eventually be able to make coalitions with people who are necessary to uh to achieve impact in the
*  world and part of being able to make coalitions implies not throwing them under the bus all the
*  time but it is extensively underrated how effective non-specialists can quickly become to be
*  and and how sort of spiky talent is distributed and how the internet can act as a force for
*  sort of like bringing together the right spike spikes of that in a very fast fashion and
*  creating leverage good with it if you had to explain or express in its most basic fundamental
*  terms why people are afraid to negotiate more and negotiate harder what's that explanation
*  there is a societal script a guest being greedy and it is such a fundamental script in so many
*  societies uh for so long that like I have a strong suspicion it might literally be baked into the
*  operating system that is being a human and the notion of negotiating for salary or negotiating
*  for anything else is something that you have to kind of like go against that cultural and
*  possibly even biological programming to be able to do now humans go against their cultural and
*  biological programming all of the time in many important ways but like it requires an immense
*  amount of effort and most people don't devote that effort or don't perceive themselves as
*  being allowed to do that in ways about salary negotiation and then this creates crazy
*  inefficiencies in the world like until quite recently I so I wrote one blog post about
*  salary negotiation back in 2010 I have 2012 I wouldn't call it a blog post but between you
*  and me on the internet it's a blog post and and hundreds of thousands of people read that every
*  year and many of them choose to write me an email and say hey um I use the advice that you wrote in
*  I can't believe it's not blog post and resulted in a plus you know 25 000 to 125 000 delta in the
*  salary I got and I keep a folder in gmail of the aggregate impact of that and stop counting some
*  time after it's like 10 million dollars plus a year for like economic impact from one blog post
*  and what do I come to I believe about this one I clearly under-optimized my selection of
*  picking things to write about because like that was the shining star in my portfolio for so long
*  and yet I never attempted to you know take the knowledge that it was the shining star and do more
*  stuff like that in the future and two like society was hideously under-optimized in that it took like
*  one guy of no special skill in this field like writing for one day on the topic to unlock tens
*  of millions of dollars of value and that's just the stuff we know about presumably there are
*  people who get a salary upgrade and do not email me about that and then um three like this implies
*  that there are a lot of sophisticated actors who are making huge huge mistakes that uh could
*  probably be ameliorated for about as you know as much effort as that blog post took to write but
*  who have not taken that effort you've left Japan you've returned to the United States you chose
*  Chicago why Chicago uh straightforward reasons on this one my parents live in Chicago and my
*  family grew up here um I feel a little bit of pain at the phrase I left Japan I'm you know
*  an American who who lived in Japan for many years and I expect at the future to at some point be an
*  American living in Japan but at the moment I'm an American living in the United States mostly for
*  family reasons what is most surprised you about returning to Chicago I am having more difficulty
*  with dealing with culture shock than my children who have never known a nation other than Japan or
*  my wife who has not materially spent uh time outside Japan uh and the shock is coming in like
*  little ways and big waves at the same time and you know as those of you who have been present in the
*  United States for less 20 years now the United States is a different country in 2023 than it was
*  when I uh you know uh kind of sort of left in 2004 and so even though I am like someone who followed
*  much of the news about this on the internet a lot of it has hit me like quite hard in the face
*  all at once but there are some things that like creep up over time that are not that uh noticed
*  but like really obvious if you if you only experience uh living in America like once every
*  20 year increments one of those those things is like portion sizes are so much larger than they
*  were when I was growing up uh to to a degree where there are many restaurants that attempt to serve
*  me things that are um the act of attempting to serve that would put me off the the notion of
*  eating because it does not seem to be designed to be an amount of food edible by a normal person
*  with my anchor for what normal people ate in like the you know late 1990s um and this is not just
*  me saying this by the way you can like you know look at uh pictures of McDonald's portion sizes
*  over time and and track them as they go up into the right um uh the there are a lot of little
*  things that Japan does right uh it seems to um I call it the will to have nice things in the
*  United States many places lacks the will to have nice things and suffers the consequences of that
*  and you know these are just a million little paper cut annoyances like the delivery company
*  deciding to deliver my bed to the middle of the front yard because they couldn't get into the
*  house uh and you know we are a rich and powerful nation that puts up with such obviously suboptimal
*  things like that and I'm hitting a lot of them all at once and it is uh causing a degree of culture
*  shock and reverse culture shock rather last question what is it you plan to learn about next
*  uh
*  I have an answer to this question it is uh more of the engineering reality of uh geothermal
*  heat and uh electricity extraction between six and ten kilometers below the surface of the earth
*  because I'm going to be doing a tiny bit of pro bono work on behalf of a um uh
*  uh non-profit organization that is attempting to popularize that technology as part of the
*  energy mix of the max couple of years and you're bullish on it I take it I think I'm bullish on it
*  met Jamie who's the founder of this organization uh two years ago and it was the um we ever had
*  that idea that just sticks with you and like torments you and your dreams and it's the thing
*  that you can't get out the head your head even as you uh go through many other things in life
*  like this has very little professional connection to all the things that that I've ever done but is
*  the idea that uh uh that will not let me uh alone in my quiet moments and so I will have to exercise
*  it by by learning about this and and seeing if uh it if the field deserves to to have its current
*  hold on me and if not I will find something else to raffle on but if yes then should probably do
*  something with that knowledge Patrick McKenzie thank you very much thank you very much
