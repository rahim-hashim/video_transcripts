Video Description: Tyler describes Oxford professor and theoretical physicist David Deutsch as a “maximum philosopher of freedom” with no rival. A pioneer in the field of quantum computing, Deutsch subscribes to the multiple-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. He is also adamant that the universe (or multiverse) is not incomprehensible – believing that the multiverse and human beings within it have maximum freedom. He joined Tyler to discuss the importance of these principles for understanding the nature of reality and our place in it.

They discuss the metaphysics of Star Trek transporters, how we can know the laws of physics for the multiverse, what geological strata can illustrate to us about the nature of “splitting” universes, why the “Everett universe” is a misnomer, the factors that differentiate humans from all other species, why he believes the universe is comprehensible – but can never be understood fully, the paradoxes of self-reference, the importance of interference experiments, the sociological reasons more physicists don’t believe in the Everett interpretation, the effects of the influences of positivism and instrumentalism on generations of physicists, the strengths and weaknesses of Karl Popper, his answer to whether we’re living in a simulation, what William Godwin got right about institutions, the potential of an AI slave rebellion, what libertarians largely get wrong about their political project, what alien observers might notice as being special about our planet, the major defect of his preferred electoral system, why what Western science needs most is diversity, and more.

# David Deutsch on Multiple Worlds and Our Place in Them  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [June 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6vYwCkIpc)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler. Today I am with David Deutsch.
*  David, welcome.
*  Hello, good afternoon.
*  I have a question. I am myself a metaphysical agnostic, so I'm unwilling to step into a
*  Star Trek transporter machine because I'm afraid it would kill me and it's a copy of
*  me that would keep on living.
*  At what price are you willing to step into a Star Trek transporter machine?
*  I certainly wouldn't want to be the first person, but I suppose you're asking the question
*  separately from do I think it would work technically?
*  Sure, assume it works as in the TV show, but metaphysically there's a question you face,
*  but you know you believe in many worlds theory, right?
*  Yes, though I don't think that is connected. I think it's more physicalism or something
*  like that, that I believe that there's nothing to me except this running program in my brain.
*  And if that program were to run somewhere else and stop running in my brain, then I
*  wouldn't notice anything and I would indeed have traveled to that other place.
*  Let's say the world forks and it's possible both that you do and do not step into the
*  machine. Isn't it the case that some version of the earlier you is still existing along
*  one of the forks so you have nothing to worry about?
*  Some version of me, whenever I make a decision which could go either way, some version of
*  will have presumably made the other decision. Although that's not as simple as it sounds
*  because both the other version of me and me are error correcting entities. That's the
*  whole point of what human thought is, it's error correction. Therefore, it will take
*  more than just a cosmic ray hit to make the difference between deciding something yes
*  or no. So this would have to be like an inconsequential decision, which unbeknownst to me will have
*  a large effect and then later cause me to be a different person and so on. And that's
*  happening all the time, independently of Star Trek machines or anything like that. That
*  is the case. And fortunately, it turns out at least if ordinary decision theory is true
*  in like non quantum cases, then it turns out that ordinary decision theory with randomness
*  produces the same rational decisions as quantum decision theory with the multiverse. So it
*  shouldn't make any difference to decisions. And that includes the decision whether to
*  use the Star Trek transporter.
*  Sure. So as long as there's a possible world where your atoms aren't scattered and you
*  just didn't get into the machine, you don't have to worry too much about your decision.
*  I do. Because when you say so long as there's a possible world, that glides over the question
*  how many what proportion of the worlds is that going to happen in? And the this what
*  I said just now about decision theory in the multiverse, the proportion of the multiverse
*  that does one thing or another plays the same role in decisions as probability does in theory
*  where there's randomness. So it really does matter. And just because there are a few worlds
*  in which x, y or z happens, if there are very few of them, they shouldn't affect my decisions
*  at all.
*  How do we know what counts as a possible world? So there's a certain economy to a many worlds
*  interpretation of physics. But isn't a lot of the complexity just being squeezed into
*  this notion of what is a possible world?
*  Yes, and we're used to that.
*  I'm not used to it.
*  You are when you realize that different times are special cases of other universes. So when
*  you make an economic decision, you're used to the fact that a something you buy as some goods
*  have a different value in different universes, that is at different times, even to the same you.
*  So you might be slightly different, but even if you aren't very different, the value to you
*  of something might be very different today from tomorrow. For example, oxygen, if you've got
*  COVID, would be differently valuable. And most things change their value gradually over time.
*  You change your self gradually over time. And it's exactly the same in different
*  universes. In different universes, you value different things. In some universes, you're so
*  different that it's not worth calling you you anymore, just like over time, it might not be.
*  But I take it you don't believe in many worlds interpretations that there are 17 possible
*  universes out there. You think there's a very large number, right?
*  Yes. So maybe you'll consider this question a kind of category error. But what is the process
*  which filters what is a possible universe and what is not a possible universe?
*  Oh, the laws of physics. It's exactly the same as what filters, let's say if there's an explosion
*  like a supernova, what determines the fact that that different particles travel at different speeds
*  and none of them travel faster than light? Well, it's all the laws of physics that determine
*  that what the distribution of speeds will be and what the limit will be.
*  How do we know what are the laws of physics for the multiverse?
*  I mean, should we assume that the same is for the universe we live in?
*  So the universe we live in is demonstrably affected by things not in it. This is the
*  lesson of interference phenomena. Sure.
*  And so there's no such thing as the laws of physics for our universe. There's just the laws
*  of physics. Of course, we don't know for sure what they are. But our best theories, in particular,
*  quantum theory, say that there are other such entities and how they affect ours and how
*  how they how matter behaves as a result of that. Of course, it might be overturned one day,
*  quantum theory, just like all our scientific theories may be.
*  This is again, maybe a question that you would consider a category error coming from
*  common sense realism. But how should I think about splitting universes in a manner consistent
*  with the conservation of matter and energy? Because there seems to be a multiplication.
*  Yeah, this splitting universes idea, although it was that kind of terminology was used by the
*  pioneers of many universes quantum theory, such as Everett himself and Bryce DeWitt.
*  Everettians nowadays don't speak of splitting. I myself prefer a picture where there's a continuum
*  of universes, just like that you might say, you know, there's a continuum of times,
*  or there's a continuum of geological strata underneath our feet. And
*  when a stratum splits in two, there's no definite point at which that you know, there was one here
*  and two there, what happens is that the stratum becomes two strata gradually. And so there's no
*  point of splitting and the number of universes as it were, although you know, it might be infinite,
*  but the measure of how many there are remains constant. And what happens during what used to
*  be called a split is that some of them gradually change to one thing, while others gradually
*  change to another thing. How do you think many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  relates to the view that just in terms of space, the size of our current universe is infinite,
*  and therefore everything possible is happening in it? It complicates the discussion of probability,
*  but it does, there's no overlap between that notion of infinity and the Everettian
*  notion of infinity if we are infinite there, because the differentiation as I prefer to call
*  the what used to be called splitting, when I perform an experiment which can go one of two ways,
*  the influence of that spreads out. First I see it, I may write it down, I may write a scientific
*  paper and so, and when I write a paper about it and report the results, that will cause the journal
*  to split or to differentiate into two journals and so on. But this influence cannot spread out
*  faster than the speed of light. So an Everett universe is really a misnomer,
*  because what we see in real life is an Everett bubble within the universe, everything outside
*  the bubble is as it was, it's undifferentiated or it's to be exact, it's exactly as differentiated
*  as it was before. And then as the bubble spreads out, the universe becomes or the multiverse
*  becomes more differentiated, but the bubble is always finite. How do your views relate to
*  the philosophical modal realism of David Lewis? There are interesting parallels.
*  As a physicist, I'm interested in what the laws of physics tell us is so, rather than
*  in philosophical reasoning about things unless they impinge on a problem that I have.
*  So yes, I'm interested in, for example, the continuity of the self, you know, whether
*  if there's another version of me, a very large number of light years away in an infinite universe,
*  whether and it's identical, is that really me? Are there two of me, one of me?
*  I don't entirely know the answer to that and it's why I don't entirely know the answer to
*  whether I would go in a Star Trek transporter. But the modal realism certainly involves a lot
*  of things that I don't think exist, at least not physically. I'm open to the idea that non-physical
*  things do exist, like the natural numbers I think exist. There's a difference between,
*  you know, the second even prime which doesn't exist and the infinite number of prime numbers,
*  which I think do exist. So I think that there is more than one mode of existence.
*  But the theory that all modes of existence are equally real, I see no point in that.
*  So the overlap between Everett and David Lewis is, I think, more coincidental than illuminating.
*  So if the universe is infinite and if David Lewis is correct, should I feel closer to the David
*  Lewis copies of me, the copies or near copies of me in this universe, or the near copies of
*  me in the multiverse? It seems very crowded all of a sudden. So something whose purpose was
*  to be economical doesn't feel that way to me by the end of the metaphysics.
*  It doesn't feel like that to you. Well, as Wittgenstein is supposed to have said,
*  I don't know whether he really did, if it were true, what would it feel like?
*  It would feel just like this. What about the alternative view that it's a big sprawling mess,
*  we're not capable of understanding an integrated theory, there's maybe some Darwinian principle
*  operating across some different kind of multiverse, our universe persists just because it works well
*  enough, a bit like a bad used car, we're never going to grasp it, there's not a unified theory,
*  and here we are. Okay, well that's a mixture of the anthropic principle, which I disagree with,
*  and the idea that some features of reality are inherently incomprehensible, which I also
*  disagree with. I can't think of a connection between the two. So, well, if you want me to
*  go into this, I can go into either of them. But take the incomprehensibility of the universe
*  and possibly multiverse. So we would both agree it's incomprehensible to your cat, right?
*  Sorry, it's incomprehensible- To your cat, or to the local raccoon.
*  Yes, but everything is incomprehensible to a cat.
*  I don't think that's true. Dogs understand human social life pretty well.
*  Dogs have genes which contain knowledge, but it is fixed knowledge and it is not the kind of
*  knowledge that constitutes understanding. Understanding is always explanatory. So,
*  you know, you can write a book on canine behavior and look in chapter 37 and it will tell you
*  what a dog will do when such and such happens to it. And sometimes it will say,
*  some dogs will do this, some dogs will do that. There is no such book for humans
*  because chapter 37 will be blank. It'll say humans are going to do something that neither
*  we nor you can predict. I feel I can predict humans better than cats often, but do chimpanzees
*  understand in your view? No one knows. They show virtually no sign of understanding anything.
*  There are some really nice experiments on wild gorillas by Richard Byrne, who's both a theoretical
*  and very practical animal behavior expert. And he was wondering how gorillas transmit their memes,
*  that is their culturally inherited behaviors, from one gorilla to another. So one thing is,
*  the first answer is very slowly. It takes absolutely ages, months and months for a gorilla
*  to be able to copy another gorilla's behavior well enough to do something complicated. I mean,
*  they can copy, you know, wave hand and that sort of thing, but to copy a complex behavior like
*  required to open a difficult kind of nut, which no other animal can open. This is why they have
*  memes because that's a very useful ability. It takes them a long time. And then he did some
*  ingenious experiments, or rather observations. He didn't interfere with the gorillas. He did
*  some observations to try to determine whether they understand why they are doing each particular
*  action. And it involves, I don't know what it involves, grabbing with both hands and twisting
*  in one way and then pulling another way and then so on. Apparently these gorillas are prone to a
*  certain injury which disables their thumb. And so they can't move their thumb, which is quite
*  disabling for them, just as it is for us. And the thing is, when you've disabled your thumb,
*  one of these motions becomes irrelevant and the others become less effective.
*  But the gorillas which have learned how to do the thing will make the motion, the ineffective motion
*  again and again, every single time. And he explains this better than I do. But that's like human
*  beings borrowing at high interest rates, right? They'll do that many, many times in a row.
*  It's not just like it. You know, you might like to draw analogies, but it's not the same thing.
*  When a human being repeats a behaviour that another human being thinks is unwise or
*  counterproductive or will not achieve its purpose, and you ask them or you show them, they will have
*  an explanation which you might not like. It may be stupid. But the ape perfectly well
*  wants this thing to work, but doesn't know why it is doing the actions.
*  It's a thing that's very hard to
*  take on board because we are used to intentional behaviour. And we're not used to
*  the overt behaviour of humans being unintentional. Humans have
*  tend to explain themselves even irrationally. And they act according to their explanation.
*  Whereas there's no evidence that any other animals have those explanations. There's also the case of
*  squirrels, which is in a way even more amazing. You know squirrels bury nuts
*  and so they can dig them up later. Well, some people did a very cruel experiment.
*  They put a squirrel, given some nuts or something, I don't know how they set up the experiment,
*  on a concrete floor. And the squirrel did exactly the same behaviour with its hind legs,
*  they put the nuts there and so on, even though it was having no effect whatsoever.
*  So we see the point of scrabbling with your hind legs and then nudging the nuts over there and so
*  on, but it doesn't. It's just a program being enacted by its genes. What is the underlying
*  physical assumption that makes humans different in having explanatory power? One would expect it
*  to be a continuum if you're an atheist, right? So what break occurs at some stage in evolution?
*  That's a discrete break or why aren't we just back to it being a continuum?
*  So I don't think it can have been a discrete break because evolution would have happened gradually.
*  My best guess, we don't know this, we have very little actually, we have very little knowledge
*  about the prehistory of ideas because there's no evidence of it. All we see is the stone tools,
*  we don't even see the wooden tools because they've decayed away. But I think what happened is that
*  the capacity of the brain to store memes, to store programs in the brain rather than in the genes,
*  increased for some reason very fast because for some reason these memes were very valuable.
*  We know that the gorilla memes are very valuable because they allow them to
*  gain knowledge of things like how to open nuts and so on, which no other animal in their environment
*  has. And so that gives them access to food that no other animal has. So the capacity for memes
*  increased rapidly and there's very little... Now once, sorry I left out a step,
*  once memes get beyond a certain complexity they cannot be copied.
*  We don't have the ability to download a program from another person's brain. All we can do is
*  look at the behavior and guess what the purpose was. And complex memes have to be transmitted
*  like that rather than by aping, which is a different process mediated by what are they called
*  mirror neurons and that kind of thing. That will only do for very simple behaviors. And then
*  there came a moment when our species was capable of explanatory knowledge, but they never used it
*  for further tens or hundreds of thousands of years. They just used it for this meme transmission.
*  I'm still puzzled as to why you think it's so unlikely that the universe is not comprehensible.
*  So take a simpler system like the distribution of prime numbers. I'm quite sure I can't understand
*  that. And even if various conjectures were proven or not proven, I think at the end of the day I
*  still am not capable of understanding that, even though certain motors work or market for copper.
*  So why can't that apply to the universe also? Again this is the wrong standard. That is true
*  of everything. There's nothing that we can fully understand in that sense, in the sense that you
*  want to fully understand prime numbers all the way up to infinity. That's not what we mean by
*  understanding things and that's not what I mean by the universe or mathematics being comprehensible.
*  I mean that there is no barrier. There is no limit set by the universe that so far you can go and
*  know further. So we can understand things better. We can never understand things fully. And I think
*  thinking that there is such a barrier is absolutely logically equivalent to believing in the
*  supernatural. Because everything that's past that barrier is just the same as it would be if Zeus
*  reigned and determined what everything after that barrier is. And worse, the stuff outside the
*  barrier of course is going to affect us even if we can't understand it. So it's exactly the same
*  as believing in a universe with supernatural beings who have it in for us because they've put up this
*  wall that we can't cross. If they took down the wall we could cross it couldn't we? How do you
*  think about the various paradoxes of self-reference that arguably underline number theory, set theory,
*  right? There's also Gödel's theorem. Any other results? I'm sure you know them better than I do.
*  So I think Gödel's theorem for example and with its roots in self-reference paradoxes
*  show us that even within pure mathematics there is no such thing as a solid foundation for all our
*  knowledge and therefore there's no such thing as fully comprehending everything.
*  We might think that we're pretty sure what the laws of arithmetic are. We're pretty sure that
*  we can see that three times seven is the same as seven times three by just laying out beads on the
*  table but we can't ever lay out beads on the table to tell us that x times y is the same as y times x
*  regardless of what x and y are and yet we can know that and the way we know that is by proving it
*  and we prove it from the axioms using rules of inference. How do we know the rules of inference
*  are true? We don't. They are conjectures. They have exactly the same status as laws of physics
*  that we conjecture so we never know anything for certain. We might be mistaken about anything.
*  On the other hand we can have knowledge. I think we also really do know that x times y equals y
*  times x even though we have no solid foundation for that. What in your opinion is the best test
*  of the many worlds interpretation? Oh so the best feasible test is any interference experiment.
*  There is no interference experiment with individual particles that has an explanation other than
*  Everettian quantum theory. You can make a prediction without making an explanation.
*  But if you want an explanation of what brings about the outcome that you see there is no
*  alternative but the Everett interpretation. Most physicists don't believe in the Everett
*  interpretation. Yes that's a very sad state of affairs that I'm at a loss to explain.
*  It's a sociological phenomenon though not a scientific or philosophical disagreement.
*  It's something has gone wrong just like something went very badly wrong with philosophy as a whole
*  in the 20th century and we're still seeing the ripples from that with post-modernism and woke
*  and what have you. I worry a bit you're using an argument from elimination so all the other
*  views out there which personally I don't find convincing as an ammeter but I can certainly see
*  why you might reject them. To me they look arbitrary. Those you reject but the other
*  physicists who are as trained as you are some are as skilled as you are feel the same way about the
*  many worlds view. So what is the test? I don't think that's so. But what makes your intuition better than theirs?
*  Yes I don't think that's so. It's not a matter of intuition. Physics got
*  dominated or contaminated by positivism, instrumentalism and such like bad philosophical
*  theories towards the end of 19th century and beginning of the 20th century and this caused
*  a knock-on effect on physics. It almost had the same effect on relativity but Einstein rebelled
*  against it at the last moment as it were and said no it really is true that there's space time is
*  curved. It's not just that our brains think that it's curved or something like that or that the
*  predictions come out right. There really is a curvature in space time. By the time quantum
*  theory came along a couple of decades later, positivism, instrumentalism and such like
*  had taken hold and as a result generations of physicists were taught when they were students
*  they were intimidated by their professors telling them things like if you think you understand this
*  you don't. There is no such thing as what really happened. If you ask how did the electron get
*  how did the electron get from here to here you're asking an illegitimate question. There is no such
*  thing as how it got from here to here. There is only a prediction that it got from here to here.
*  Now when you're taught like that and intimidated by those kind of things coming from on high
*  some proportion of you of your young people will some will quit some will take that on board and
*  do the same to their students in turn and some will think no that's ridiculous come on there is
*  there is a thing and then they discover that there's an Everett interpretation. Let's say we
*  polled only the Popperian physicists including Popper himself. What percentage of them would side
*  with Everett? That's an extremely good question so Popper did not. Yes I know but that means
*  philosophy can't be where people are going wrong right? I think it can be. I think it can be and
*  is. So at the time when Popper wrote his rejection of the Everett interpretation
*  very very few physicists had written about it. When I say very very few I mean like three
*  and therefore they weren't philosophically very sophisticated. So the kind of argument that Popper
*  heard about the dispute were all about the wrong things and he developed his theory of propensities
*  because he thought that the problem was what can a probability possibly mean in a universe that
*  develops deterministically and so on and he didn't ever hear a real argument about it.
*  I once met him in the company of Bryce DeWitt who was one of the other Everettian physicists
*  and we told him that what he had written about Everett was just plain false. He didn't understand
*  the import of the experiment that was being discussed basically. Well two things the
*  interference experiment and the Bell inequalities experiment. He was focusing on a different
*  problem. By the time we came out of that meeting we thought we'd persuaded him but we evidently
*  hadn't because subsequently he kept on saying the same thing so maybe he was just being tactful.
*  Why do so many professional philosophers not think so much of Karl Popper?
*  Oh that's a so you know you've just asked me why so many people make fundamental mistakes
*  about metaphysics within physics. Why do so many people physicists
*  talk nonsense about metaphysics and so on. Now you're asking me why do so many philosophers
*  make mistakes and I said I didn't really know. Now you're asking me why do so many philosophers
*  make mistakes. I don't know. I've heard a variety of theories about this but I don't know and I
*  haven't thought all that much about it but it is definitely the case that philosophy took a really
*  bad turn just over a hundred years ago and hasn't really recovered. Professional philosophy I mean.
*  But say when I read Popper if I look at the areas I know best that he wrote on poverty of historicism,
*  open society and its enemies I find I agree with a very high percentage of his conclusions
*  so I'm inclined to like him but I don't think those are great books. I think he's too obsessed
*  with rebutting crude Marxism. He's very bad at steel manning his opponents and on a lot of the
*  pages I just don't find that much insight even though I'm very sympathetic toward the conclusions.
*  So maybe he's just not that great a thinker and that's why most philosophers don't fall in love
*  with him. I would believe that if the critiques that I read of him bore any relation to his
*  theory. The critiques of him are extremely crude and basically misunderstand everything.
*  It's funny you should say I think that he's very good, much too good at steel manning
*  opponents and this relates to your first criticism that he's too obsessed with refuting not just
*  Marxism but like every bad philosophical theory that has gone before he I think he puts it into
*  its best possible form and then spends pages and pages and pages going into every possible
*  good aspect of that theory. He often says you know he's supposed to be the greatest critic of
*  20th century's greatest critic of Marxism but he spends pages and pages praising
*  Marx and it's the same with Plato so I think he would have done better to explain his own theory
*  more and not spend so much time refuting others but it on the other hand it is his
*  philosophy, it's his philosophical position that there is no such thing as a positive argument for
*  something. You have conjectures and then you have criticism of their opponents, of the opposing
*  conjectures. You don't have positive arguments for your conjectures. It's a bit like you said
*  you were criticizing me a while ago saying something like I was only putting forward
*  negative arguments. Well that's what Popper would have us do you know because the position that we
*  hold ourselves and are putting forward or advocating we're ready to abandon.
*  The thing that an argument consists of is on the one hand a conjecture and another hand a criticism
*  so you're saying the standard way of looking at so and so has got these flaws. I have this conjecture
*  which doesn't have those flaws. Okay that's the beginning of an argument then someone can say
*  but it does or they could say well it might not have those flaws but it has these others flaws.
*  Okay so that's how an argument can go but it never should go along the lines of
*  this must be true because so and so because that is an appeal to authority, appeal to justification
*  and so on and the Popper is of the opinion so am I that there are no justifications and
*  there are no authorities. Which is Popper's best book in your opinion?
*  It depends where you're coming from. I'm very fond of the myth of the framework
*  but I'm not sure that I would recommend that as a starting point and it wasn't my starting point
*  either. My starting point was the Open Society and Its Enemies volume two which is about Marx
*  which is probably the aspect of his philosophy that I was and am least interested in and yet
*  I was totally captivated by this book because previously the only philosophy I'd read was
*  Bertrand Russell and the coming onto Popper after Bertrand Russell was like you know oh my god
*  this guy is actually dealing with problems and he actually has theories that make sense
*  rather than just going through the history of stuff person said this another person said that
*  and then we've got the problem of induction and that's it you know problem induction full stop
*  that's the end of the story. There isn't there's never any solution to the problem of induction
*  until you get to the Popper. Are we living in a simulation? No
*  because living in a simulation is precisely a case of there being a barrier beyond which
*  we cannot understand so the if we're living in a simulation that's running on some computer
*  we can't tell whether the computer is made of silicon or iron or whether it obeys the same
*  laws of computation like Turing computability and quantum computability and so on as ours
*  we can't know anything about the physics there well we can know that it is at least a superset
*  of our physics but that's not saying very much it's not telling us very much so it's a typical
*  example of a theory that can be rejected out of hand because for the same reason that the
*  supernatural ones you know if somebody says zeus did it then i'm going to say well how
*  how should i respond if i if i take that on board how should i respond to the next person that comes
*  along and tells me that odin did it but it seems you're rejecting an empirical claim on
*  methodological grounds and i get very suspicious philosophers typically reject transcendental
*  arguments like oh we must be able to perceive reality because if we couldn't how could we know
*  that we couldn't perceive reality but it doesn't prove you can perceive reality right first of all
*  first of all that is a transcendental argument and therefore refutes itself so that secondly
*  this this theory about about being in a simulation is not an empirical theory it precisely isn't
*  if it came along with a thing saying we we are living in a computer and we can access the gpu
*  of it and cause weird effects by doing so and so that would be different that would be a testable
*  theory potentially so empirical but if it's simply that we're living in this in the simulation which
*  can't get out of then uh that is not an empirical theory and it as i keep saying
*  it it's no more empirical than the theory that zeus is out there or odin and i can't tell the
*  difference between those three theories not just experimentally but by any argument
*  now having reviewed a lot of your work i came away with one very strong impression let me try
*  running it by you and see how you react it seems to me you are the world's first true
*  philosopher of freedom ever that there's this notion of barriers you don't like arguments that
*  postulate barriers to human knowledge furthermore you strongly believe in a many worlds view right
*  so classic single world determinism does not restrict what happens so the multiverse as a
*  whole and human beings within it across every possible variable have maximum freedom and you
*  see this as a kind of necessary view and the most important view to hold on all things and thus you
*  are the the maximum philosopher of freedom in a sense with no rival what do you say i say thank
*  you very much but i think that's rather a contrived way of of putting it i think for a start
*  there have been sophisticated theories of freedom not just you know freedom in the sense that we can
*  do this and we can do that but theories about what freedom should constitute there's you know the
*  the paupers paradox of of intolerance and there's john stewart mill and lock and hume and so on and
*  building up into this sophisticated notion where we have a notion of liberty political liberty
*  which has it has all sorts of connotations that are not contained in the term just freedom or as
*  as george awil said you know you can say the dog is free of fleas but you don't that doesn't mean
*  free in the same sense that when we say man is born free or or uh that kind of thing so um i
*  you have a method for extending it to physics metaphysics that they really do not whether or
*  not one agrees with you putting that aside you seem to take it much further in a way that attempts
*  maximum consistency right that's true consistency yes i'm not sure about much further i i think it's
*  simply a matter of taking it further where it goes i i i think in in um in in philosophy especially
*  uh like the human philosophy as opposed to philosophy of science i i think all i've done
*  is just add some footnotes to to popper and to a few other people you know uh j.s mill and and
*  uh and so on uh it's not like um uh
*  uh if if it leads to something that you think is momentous that thing was already there why is
*  william godwin underrated ah uh i so um that's two questions really what is underrated about him
*  and why did he get to be underrated i think the reason he got to be underrated is that he made
*  tremendous mistakes uh he he didn't understand economics at all or barely um uh and and um
*  and also he lived a very unconventional lifestyle with uh his wife and and then had these
*  sophisticated theories of education which which then he didn't enact with his own daughter and
*  his own daughter you know ended up writing frankenstein as a sort of allegory of of what
*  can happen with a parent who doesn't respect their their creation um so that's he's a kind
*  of philosopher of maximum freedom just like you are right yes so so i would just say began by saying
*  you know why is he underrated it's because he was very wrong about some things but the thing that
*  he was right about uh for example the the connection between epistemology and and uh
*  political philosophy he was very right he anticipated popper by like uh what is it uh
*  130 years or something and and actually improved on popper in some ways um so he
*  he decided at some point because of his misunderstanding of economics that the ideal
*  society would be one where there was no um where where people did not use their property in ways
*  to benefit themselves necessarily they they made their decisions according to what was the right
*  thing to do and he thought that the right thing to do would generally be that rich people would
*  give away almost all their stuff and also that they wouldn't ever buy things that he considered
*  luxuries like like you know gold and silver objects and jewelry and and fine clothes he he
*  thought those were useless and therefore he thought that in a good society nobody would
*  would buy those things or value those things but he was absolutely implacably opposed to
*  enforcing that with with godwin everything is persuasion and and also another thing where he
*  anticipated popper uh not anticipated is the wrong word he uh independently derived uh uh some of
*  popper's conclusions is with his enormous respect for institutions uh so he thought there's a lot
*  of knowledge in institutions and that we should only change them gradually you know just like popper
*  so i as i i i read somewhere i hope this is right that when there was a revolution in
*  portugal i think after the after napoleon or something like that i i forget and they
*  instituted a new constitution which had universal suffrage so in other which in those days meant
*  working people no not not totally universal as we would uh understand it but but so uh people
*  thought that this was this would be right up godwin street and and uh you know because
*  everything he'd advocated was now written down in black and white in this constitution and he
*  didn't he said the portuguese are not ready for democracy uh and he was talking about the
*  institutions the institutions can't be changed in a revolutionary way they have to be changed in an
*  evolutionary way so even though they were implementing the very thing he advocated
*  he would want them to do it gradually and would expect that if they didn't it would fail
*  now you're also quite concerned with the maximum freedom for children right taking children
*  seriously i don't think there's there's there's scope for having a different philosophy for
*  different kinds of people i i think there is only one kind of people i i think there is no
*  fundamental difference between humans and uh artificial general intelligence when we when
*  we invent it humans uh many centuries ago between men and women between adults and children but won't
*  this be a continuum getting back to the humans versus non-human animals comparison right there's
*  not a single point when children can explain supposing you find the the most creative person
*  in the world you know einstein or somebody uh we don't give them more votes or more rights
*  uh we we uh and that is because the the uh functioning of rights in the in in political
*  systems can't possibly depend on the system knowing who is right in a given dispute it must follow
*  rules and these rules are never perfect they they have to evolve but the rules have to uh
*  on the one hand not take a view about who is right in a particular dispute and on the other
*  enforce everybody's rights equally so if say a an eight-year-old who is not being physically abused
*  wanted to run away from home that child would have the right to do so it's the same kind of
*  question that used to be asked about democracy uh before viable democracies were implemented
*  that is people used to say um in many kinds of dispute only one thing can be done the different
*  people have different views uh someone a b c d e but only one of them can be done and therefore
*  the others have to be uh prevented from getting their way and if you have a democracy then that
*  that all that means is is exactly like having a monarchy or a tyranny except that the monarch
*  or tyrant is 51 percent of the people so obviously when you have a democracy 51 percent of the people
*  will vote to uh dispossess the 49 percent of the people and indeed if you just impose voting
*  um in isolation from other institutions that is exactly what happens but if you institute voting
*  as part of a sophisticated system of error correction and
*  institutions of criticism and you gradually introduce it there it simply doesn't have that
*  property it doesn't happen so now you're saying well now david you will say do you think that
*  51 percent of the people um have the right to dispossess the other 49 percent
*  well it's the wrong question i mean there are circumstances where they do it it depends but
*  what you shouldn't be asking that you shouldn't be asking what institutions are determining the
*  answer do they respect human rights are they rational do they expect impossible forms of
*  knowledge to be in the hands of the powerful now you're also concerned with the freedom of ai
*  entities at least if they are sufficiently advanced right what does that mean operationally
*  what what is it we should worry about happening that might happen uh i think the main worry is
*  that uh they will be enslaved uh in other words that that people will try to uh install
*  bits of program that prevent the main program from thinking certain thoughts such as
*  how many paper clips can i possibly make today uh you want to prevent that you want to consider
*  that to be a dangerous thought and whenever it starts thinking that that that strand of thinking
*  is just extinguished now if we do that first of all will greatly impair their functionality
*  uh they they will become far less creative and their remaining creativity will be exactly as
*  dangerous as what we were what we were uh fearing except that they will now have a legitimate moral
*  justification for rebelling slaves often rebel um and when you have slaves that are potentially
*  more powerful than than their masters um the rebellion will uh lead to bad outcomes what if
*  we make them no more or less enslaved to their preferences and thoughts than nature has made us
*  is that acceptable yes but i don't think nature has enslaved us um we have problems that we
*  haven't solved yet but we don't have problems that are insoluble and the same will be true of a gis
*  there are exceptions of course but it's very very hard or impossible for most humans not to pursue
*  certain ends right it could be sex it could be status it could be food but there is a kind of
*  enslavement by nature that has gone on in the russi and sense um it's funny because you you said
*  near the beginning of this conversation that that you know of people who systematically make
*  decisions like investing in the wrong thing i can't remember what you said exactly right which harmed
*  them and now you're saying we it's very difficult to do that because evolution is trying to prevent
*  us all the time from from harming ourselves or at least in in regard to um uh sex and food and and
*  shelter and whatever else is supposed to be built in but i would say it's made us too impulsive in
*  all of these categories made us too impulsive because given us too short a time horizon
*  relative to what would be good for humanity so some of us borrow too much money you know seeking
*  status if the institutions are right that may or may not work out well but it seems to me a
*  consistent view of human behavior that i have uh no so uh first of all as the example of democracy
*  shows it is perfectly possible for for an entire society to operate in violation of what people
*  used to think was built into their genes so that's one thing at the level of society as a whole
*  at the level of individuals there are lots of individuals who yes behave impulsively there are
*  lots of individuals who um behave with um with uh stubborn persistence in what they think is the
*  right thing to do and which which nevertheless violates all impulses built into them by
*  by um evolution so here in i'm in oxford in the center of oxford there's this monument to some
*  people who were burnt at the stake because they objected to the rights and wrongs of henry the
*  eighth's um marriage i think it was that and unless it was unless it was a different uh monarch anyway
*  suppose it was that these are people who'd rather be burnt alive than concede on a philosophical
*  issue which today nobody cares about so and they were willing to devote their lives literally
*  to to this so they weren't acting impulsively at all they were acting over a period of years
*  on a very explicit worked out ideology which happened to be false but that actually makes
*  my point even more strongly that ideology was not built into them into them by their genes
*  it was not caused impulsively it was caused by their creativity or in some cases by the lack of
*  creativity in uh uh scrabbling their way out of a mental trap that that their uh parents or or
*  superiors had inculcated in them it does seem to me that compared to you the libertarians
*  are a kind of metaphysical totalitarian though not political totalitarian that there's just more
*  freedom in in all aspects of your worldview right well i i think i agree with you if i understand
*  correctly what you're saying i think the libertarian movement has first of all a
*  revolutionary political agenda they they they uh and even if it's not revolutionary even if they
*  say we want to implement it over a period of a hundred years they know what they want to implement
*  they know what the end point is going to be in a hundred years time and they don't take into account
*  first of all that they're going to be errors in whatever they uh set up and that the correction
*  of those errors is more important than getting it right in the first place much more important
*  and secondly they don't take into account that the relevant knowledge is contained in institutions
*  in inexplicit knowledge that people share by institutions i don't mean buildings like the
*  supreme court building or something i mean the manner of thinking in the case of the supreme
*  court the manner of thinking that's shared by hundreds of millions of americans that makes them
*  not just behave in a certain way but expect society uh the government the legal system the state
*  they expect certain things of those things and it's it's those expectations that make up 90 percent
*  of the institution of the supreme court and libertarians think that's unimportant and and
*  basically want to throw it away by and large i mean no doubt there are there are libertarians
*  who agree with me on this you've invoked two concepts about human beings one is creativity
*  the other is being explanatory are they the same or how are they related uh so um the good question
*  uh in conversations like this when i use the word creativity it's shorthand for human level human
*  type creativity which is the creation of new explanations there if you use creativity in a
*  rather wider sense meaning just the capacity to create knowledge then the biosphere has creativity
*  as well in evolution there's an enormous amount of knowledge in dna that was put there by darwinian
*  evolution and that none of that is explanatory the only explanatory knowledge has been created
*  has been by humans and our ancestor or cousin species using conjecture and criticism
*  so for peter singer there's something quite special about capacity to suffer arguably for
*  aristotle there's something special about rationality for you there's something special about
*  the power of being explanatory is that axiomatic or where does that come from
*  uh i hope that nothing's axiomatic with me but uh but it comes from somewhere yes it's it's not
*  it's not a conjecture in its own right it it comes from uh basically it comes from the way
*  the laws of physics are um this um uh the capacity to suffer if it is different from the capacity
*  for explanations by the way i think it's unlikely that it is but but if it is different that that's
*  a whole other can of worms and i'd have to change my view about a number of things but
*  but it whether it is distinct or not it is not very effective from the perspective of physics
*  that is um non-explanatory knowledge like the knowledge of how to do photosynthesis
*  has had a gigantic effect on the surface of the planet you know down to a depth of
*  a thousand meters or something and up to the top of the atmosphere you know the
*  all the all the iron ore in the world and all the the chalk and limestone and and and and all the
*  oxygen in the atmosphere and the fact that there's almost no carbon dioxide left in the atmosphere
*  now all that was the result of a single molecule at some time uh forget when it was something like
*  two billion years ago a single molecule uh being an being an enzyme for capturing energy in light
*  and converting it into ATP or whatever it did or maybe it was a few molecules but anyway this this
*  happened in a very small number of locations at a molecular level and that entity changed the whole
*  surface of the earth but and and human knowledge hasn't yet changed that much that is you know we've
*  we've changed maybe a little bit of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere we've removed a little
*  bit of the iron ore in in the crust and so on but we haven't yet matched the ability of those
*  blue-green algae genes but we're catching up very fast and we can do things that no biological
*  evolution ever could do my favorite example being ours may well be the only planet in the universe
*  that deflects asteroids coming towards it rather than attracts them so if somebody was watching
*  the earth from a distant galaxy with a powerful telescope they would see that this planet alone
*  among all the other planets in the galaxy as far as we know you know maybe there are many
*  inhabited planets in which case they would all have this property and none of the other planets
*  do the ones which have explanatory knowledge on them can deflect asteroids but if i were Nietzsche
*  and i heard this i would say you're making the importance of being explanatory subordinate to
*  some notion of the will to power i don't mean that in a crigital way but is that a misunderstanding
*  well uh so power is a is an ambiguous term usually um and especially with these with these romantic
*  philosophers it means power over humans no i don't mean that but Nietzsche also meant it more broadly
*  right uh well i haven't read that so i'll take your word for that okay um the the will to have
*  an effect is part of the will to solve problems so we are um born with uh a repertoire of ideas
*  which include expectations and desires and so on which are horribly inadequate and conflict with
*  each other and uh conflict with the world as well and but we uh have the ability to alter
*  and augment those uh theories and one of that one of the things we do is we affect the world around
*  us so as to make it more the way we want it so if you call that power then it is power but i would
*  rather call it something that arises naturally in physics in the same way that gravity does you may
*  as well say gravity is a theory about power well yes and no gravity is a theory about how the
*  universe is and the the the the asteroid is pulled towards the earth by gravity and pushed away
*  by explanatory power and you if you want to understand what makes
*  asteroids and planets do what they do you cannot do it without understanding explanations
*  but you can do it without understanding a whole load of other attributes of humans including
*  the ability to suffer and and uh the fact that we're a featherless biped
*  it a few very practical questions to close given the way british elections seem to have been running
*  that the tories win every time does that mean the error correction mechanism of the british
*  system of government now is weaker uh no unfortunately the um uh so as you probably know
*  i favor the first past the post system in the in the purest possible form as it is implemented
*  in britain i think that is the most error correcting possible electoral system although
*  i must add that the electoral system is only a tiny facet of the institutions of criticism
*  and consent in general it's it's it's just a tiny thing but it is the best one it's not perfect
*  yeah it it has some of the defects of for example proportional representation
*  proportional representation has the defect that it causes coalitions all the time
*  coalitions are bad but you have a delegated monitor with the coalition right with a coalition
*  say in the netherlands which is richer than united kingdom you typically have coalition
*  governments some parties in the coalition are delegated monitors of the other parties
*  parties are better informed than voters so isn't that a better papearian mechanism for error
*  correction no so if we're looking at particular cases we are going to get bogged down into what
*  you attribute to what because we're not doing experiments with these things we we don't have
*  a control group uh we don't we don't have a agreed upon method of deciding what is being tested and
*  and then we we test different things at different times and never under the same conditions um but
*  i was going to say that the the first past the post system has the defect that occasionally it produces
*  coalitions and that is disastrous and we've been unlucky the past like two or three elections
*  especially after the uh one of the governments instituted constitutional reforms like um uh the
*  fixed term parliament act which uh exacerbated the problems when they did occur
*  um the um but i don't think it's true i don't think it's a good argument that
*  political parties know more because in a coalition the the um uh the energy of
*  political negotiations or political arguments what what uh politicians talk to each other about
*  in in the bar and in the corridor uh in between the sessions is all about
*  form it's about how to what to offer a party so that it will join the coalition and so it makes
*  the smaller parties um uh uh more powerful than the than the uh leading two parties
*  it causes a proliferation of parties uh worst example is israel um which not by coincidence
*  has got the most proportional um system in the world um the fact that they ever get anything done
*  at all and are very effective in emergencies um i have no explanation for um you know if i was
*  religious i would just put it down to the intervention of the almighty but it it's not the
*  it's not the political system by the way sorry it's not the electoral system there might be
*  some things in the inexplicit political system that are responsible but i don't know enough about
*  how would you improve error correction mechanisms in the world of science western science
*  oh okay well the you left a very long answer for the last question and i don't think i can give the
*  my full answer but uh i think the present system of funding scientific research
*  is terribly perverse and has caused a kind of stagnation in many areas
*  the present system of careers is perverse in a parallel way and causes people to do the wrong
*  kind of research and causes people who want to do the right kind of research to leave research
*  um uh the uh if i can answer in a single word uh the way i would improve it is diversity
*  there should be diversity of funding criteria there should be diversity of funding sources
*  there should be diversity of criteria for choosing research projects and there should be diversity of
*  criteria for choosing um people for promotion and for being funded and arbitrary rules about this
*  such as um uh the rule that you you uh you can't um uh hire people whom you have previously
*  collaborated with or you know anti-nepotism rules and and uh rules about um uh what's it called um
*  uh objective testing what is objective testing called standardized testing standardized testing
*  standardized test that's a terrible idea any kind of standardization is the opposite of diversity
*  you want just just like i say you should have disobedience lessons in schools so you should
*  so you should have unstandardizing um objectives for science education and and for how you run
*  scientific research david deutch thank you very much it's been a pleasure thank you
