*  I'm here today with Michelle Gelfand, who is a professor of psychology at the University [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=89.64s)]
*  of Maryland, and she has a very interesting new book out called Rulemakers, Rule Breakers, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=98.2s)]
*  How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire Our World. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=104.68s)]
*  Welcome, Michelle. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=107.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=108.32s)]
*  Now, in one of your ratings, you mentioned that New Zealand is arguably the loosest country [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=109.32s)]
*  or culture on this planet. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=114.48s)]
*  Why does New Zealand qualify in that regard? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, I would say it's of the loosest, not the loosest. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  In our study, we measured perceptions that people had of the strength of the norms in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=121.48s)]
*  their cultural context. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  And New Zealanders, like many people around the world, agreed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=127.2s)]
*  They shared perceptions about the strength of norms, and they categorized their culture [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  as being relatively loose and permissive and having a wide range of behavior that was permissible. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=133.76s)]
*  But can we trust what Kiwi say? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=139.08s)]
*  So I think of New Zealand as a place where conformity is relatively strong. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=141.08s)]
*  There's a norm, a phrase, cutting down tall poppies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=145.84s)]
*  You don't stand out too much. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=148.32s)]
*  They might deviate a lot on small things, but there's oddly little radicalism there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=149.92s)]
*  And to me, they seem a bit cautious. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  They have lots of impulse control, and they're extremely polite. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Does that make them loose or tight? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=160.4s)]
*  It's a really great question. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=161.88s)]
*  You know, all cultures have tight and loose domains. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=162.88s)]
*  And New Zealand is a place, like you said, that has some domains that are pretty tight. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=166.28s)]
*  And some of these domains evolve for good reasons. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=170.16s)]
*  The value of egalitarianism is really important in New Zealand. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=172.78s)]
*  So tall poppies are cut down because that threatens that value. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=175.96s)]
*  And in all cultures, I would argue that some domains evolved to be tight because they're [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=179.6s)]
*  really important in that culture. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=184.12s)]
*  The United States is a great example. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  Privacy is a very important domain here, so we tend to be pretty regulated about it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=187.52s)]
*  If I just show up at someone's house, even if it's a close friend unannounced, I'll [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=191.28s)]
*  get some pretty strong feedback. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=194.52s)]
*  So even in the United States, which is relatively loose, we have some domains that are tight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  So what would be a social phenomenon that the degree of tightness or looseness in a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=199.5s)]
*  culture or country might explain? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=203.72s)]
*  Many things. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  Actually, in the book, I talk about the tradeoffs that tight and loose provide for human groups. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Tight groups tend to have a lot of synchrony, a lot of coordination, a lot of self-control. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=211.68s)]
*  Loose groups, generally speaking, are very disorganized and they have self-regulation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=216.44s)]
*  failures, problems with self-regulation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  But on the flip side, tight cultures tend to struggle with openness. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=221.64s)]
*  They have more ethnocentrism, they're less creative, and they're less open to change. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=225.56s)]
*  And that's where loose cultures have a market. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=229.96s)]
*  They're very open, even if they're slightly disorganized. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=232.52s)]
*  In one of your papers, you give some 2011 rankings, where if I recall, the three tightest [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=236.52s)]
*  cultures were in this order, Malaysia, Pakistan, and India. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  And they don't seem very orderly when you go there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=246.08s)]
*  So what makes them tight? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=249.44s)]
*  Isn't it the case that they, in some regards, maybe have oppressive norms, but they absolutely [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  fail at regulating behavior in some regards. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  If you try standing in a queue, at least, say, in India, it's a highly disorderly experience. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=257.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=263.72s)]
*  I mean, these are very crowded places that are relatively poor. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=264.72s)]
*  And so those domains, in terms of things like traffic or coordinating, like you said, in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=267.0s)]
*  cutting lines, these are things that tend to be loosened. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=272.04s)]
*  But in many domains, they tend to be very tight. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=274.64s)]
*  In the domain of marriage, in the domain of sexuality, in authority, in language. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=276.44s)]
*  These are very strong rules that people have to abide by. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=280.76s)]
*  And if they deviate, then there's strong punishments. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=283.72s)]
*  I think these are really important observations. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  Every culture has some type domains and some loose domains. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=288.0s)]
*  And it's really helpful for people to develop cultural intelligence, not just emotional [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=290.96s)]
*  intelligence or general intelligence when they're traveling, and understand and anticipate [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=294.76s)]
*  what domains are going to be tight and loose. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=299.36s)]
*  Japan's another example. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=301.48s)]
*  It's really tight. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=302.76s)]
*  But there's some domains that become totally loose. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=303.76s)]
*  Takashi Street, I talked about it in the book. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=306.92s)]
*  It's a place where anything goes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  After hours in organizations, anything goes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=310.92s)]
*  You need, in a very tight culture, some places that you can let off some steam and become [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=313.04s)]
*  quite loose. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Any culture needs both tightness and looseness. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=319.92s)]
*  And I would argue, and I talk about the Goldilocks Principle, that any culture that gets too [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=322.32s)]
*  extreme in terms of looseness or tightness has a lot of problems. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  In that 2011 rating, if the three most tight are listed as Malaysia, Pakistan, India, and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=330.12s)]
*  then the three next most tight are Singapore, South Korea, and Norway, might we infer that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=335.48s)]
*  there are two kinds of tightness somehow, that Malaysia, Pakistan, India belong together, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=341.4s)]
*  but Singapore, South Korea, and Norway deserve a separate dimension, and that tightness, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=345.88s)]
*  looseness is too few dimensions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=350.32s)]
*  There ought to be three, four, maybe more. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=352.08s)]
*  In our data, it's a great question. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=354.0s)]
*  We didn't find any multidimensionality to the scale in terms of factor analysis. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  But also when we look at banding, we statistically group cultures. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=359.44s)]
*  Those groups actually banded together. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=362.64s)]
*  So in our data, they pretty clearly fall together, even if they appear very different. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=364.88s)]
*  There's a really interesting reason why cultures evolved to be tight or loose, and maybe that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=370.84s)]
*  could help to explain why some of these cultures seem so different. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=374.52s)]
*  They actually are quite similar in terms of the strength of norms. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=378.64s)]
*  Tight cultures, both in modern day and in ancient history from our research with anthropologists [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  and archaeologists, they don't share a similar religion. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  They don't share the same location. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  They don't share the same language. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  But they do share one fundamental aspect of their sociality, which is that they experience, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  generally speaking, a lot of threat. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=398.12s)]
*  And threats can be varied from ecological threats to man-made threats. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=399.98s)]
*  And that might help to explain some of the ranking that you see. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=403.68s)]
*  Now, as you know, it's a common distinction in cross-cultural analysis to call some cultures [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=406.06s)]
*  individualistic and others collectivistic. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=410.94s)]
*  How does tightness and looseness differ from that distinction? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=413.8s)]
*  What do you pick up that say the work of Triandus does not? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, actually, Triandus is my mentor. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=419.70000000000005s)]
*  And I went to Champaign to work with him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  And actually, I did a lot of research on collectivism, individualism. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=423.36s)]
*  For a long time, that was the kind of one dimension that we really looked at in cross-cultural [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=426.34s)]
*  psychology. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=430.78s)]
*  It's almost akin to, in personality psychology, only studying extroversion to the neglect [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=431.78s)]
*  of other dimensions like neuroticism. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=436.3s)]
*  So in cross-cultural psychology, we kind of got a little bit narrow in what we were studying. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=437.92s)]
*  Collectivism, individualism is related to tightness, but distinct. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=442.24s)]
*  And part of the problem we've had is we've confounded cultures in our research. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=445.82s)]
*  We've been studying East Asia, which is both tight and collectivistic, with the United [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=449.18s)]
*  States and other Western cultures, which tend to be loose and individualistic. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=452.88s)]
*  So they've been confounded. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=456.64s)]
*  But when you think about sort of the off diagonals of that two by two, you can imagine cultures [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=458.2s)]
*  like Germany, Switzerland, Austria, that tend to be pretty individualistic. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=462.23999999999995s)]
*  They emphasize privacy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=466.28s)]
*  They're not hugely group and family oriented, but they're relatively tight. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=467.28s)]
*  They have strong rules and punishments for deviance. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=470.64s)]
*  Or on the flip side, you can think about Latin American cultures, and our data, that's Brazil [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  or Spain, that tend to be pretty family oriented and pretty collectivistic, but they're rather [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=476.44s)]
*  loose. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=480.96s)]
*  In a lot of ways, you can disentangle that variation, even if they're related. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=482.08s)]
*  They tend to be related about point four, and that's found both in modern nations and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=486.56s)]
*  also traditional societies. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=490.76s)]
*  At the state level, they're also tend to be related, but again, distinct. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=492.58s)]
*  Only in that case, it's about point two or point three, the correlation between tightness [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  and collectivism. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  Would the notions of tightness and looseness, say, predict big five personality variables [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  like conscientiousness, openness? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=506.0s)]
*  Well, these are different levels of analysis, and I think it's really important to think [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=507.59999999999997s)]
*  about cultures as systems. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=510.96s)]
*  So you have very macro level factors like threat, and then you have personality at the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=513.04s)]
*  individual level. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=517.36s)]
*  And the question is, is how do those relate to each other? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=518.36s)]
*  In the science paper, I tried to develop a multilevel model that specified different [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=520.48s)]
*  factors that help reinforce tightness at different levels. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=524.46s)]
*  And so certainly at the individual level, I would say that openness, the big five dimension, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=527.52s)]
*  and conscientiousness are really critical for making up and reinforcing the strength [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=531.96s)]
*  of norms. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=536.56s)]
*  So loose cultures need people, socialize people to be open, because you need to actually [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=537.8s)]
*  tolerate a lot of ambiguity in loose cultures. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=542.66s)]
*  You're going to see a lot of weird stuff happening. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=544.92s)]
*  Tight cultures have stronger norms, like think about being in a library, need people that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=547.16s)]
*  have a lot of self-regulation and a lot of prevention focus in order to fit into those [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  contexts and maintain them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=555.52s)]
*  So I think there is a connection, and you could start thinking about how norms and personality [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  make each other up. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=562.06s)]
*  They can't exist without each other in a large extent. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=563.12s)]
*  Now I'm from northern New Jersey. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=566.2s)]
*  Do you regard that as a tight or a loose region? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=567.4s)]
*  I know you have state-level variables, but of course we can't count the south here. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=570.04s)]
*  Well, I'm from Long Island, so we have a little bit of a rivalry, although I will say that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=573.16s)]
*  as I've grown older, I think Jersey's definitely a much nicer place than Long Island. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=577.4s)]
*  Sorry for my Long Island friends out there. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=581.24s)]
*  New Jersey and our data at the state level falls in the relatively loose category. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=583.04s)]
*  When we rank over to the 50 states, we can see a new way to think about our variation [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=587.96s)]
*  not just red or blue, but again, tight or loose. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=592.92s)]
*  And New Jersey tends to be on the looser side. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=596.68s)]
*  The coast tends to be looser. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  The south tends to be tighter in our data. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=600.64s)]
*  We can think about this both in terms of, again, threat. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=602.52s)]
*  Threat tends to predict tightness even in the United States. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=605.36s)]
*  If you look at the map that the New York Times published early this summer in terms of natural [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=607.8s)]
*  disasters, it's very closely aligned with our map of tightness in the United States. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=611.12s)]
*  The south has been the victim of Mother Nature's fury for years, and it also has a lot of other [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=615.16s)]
*  threats. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=620.04s)]
*  The founders' effects that I talk about in the book of the East Coast has been a diverse [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=621.04s)]
*  place for centuries, as has been the West Coast, and diversity promotes looseness. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=625.12s)]
*  One of your ratings of the states has the five tightest as being Mississippi, Alabama, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=630.88s)]
*  Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=635.88s)]
*  Those strike me as some of the states where maybe a stranger is most likely to shoot you [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=638.52s)]
*  in a bar, and I understand they may be tight as a kind of response to threat and danger. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=642.06s)]
*  But isn't this showing that there are always two dimensions? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  They have some norms that are tight precisely because the places themselves are not tight [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=650.32s)]
*  and things can spiral out of control and be somewhat chaotic and disorderly. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=654.72s)]
*  And what you're measuring is always one side of the coin, but it's exactly offset by other [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=659.44s)]
*  chaotic features of these places. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=664.62s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=666.72s)]
*  I mean, the south is both tight and it's also honor-oriented. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=667.72s)]
*  The people who settled in the south were coming from contexts where honor was very important [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=670.6800000000001s)]
*  because of the weak institutions in that context. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=674.62s)]
*  So honor evolves when you need strong rules to regulate behavior. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=677.18s)]
*  All honor cultures, or many, are tight, but not all tight cultures are honor cultures. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=681.5799999999999s)]
*  So you can also separate out what's happening in the south from what's happening around [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=685.8199999999999s)]
*  the world. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=689.4799999999999s)]
*  I will say that the stranger getting shot in a bar is, I would disagree with that, because [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=690.4799999999999s)]
*  usually what's happening in these contexts is when you have a honor threat, when you [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=694.8399999999999s)]
*  have an insult to someone. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=699.5s)]
*  We know from a lot of our evolutionary game theory models and other computational work [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=701.26s)]
*  Honor evolves in contexts where you need to defend your reputation. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=705.46s)]
*  So those kinds of contexts are places where people felt the need to defend themselves [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=708.46s)]
*  for survival. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=713.98s)]
*  So it's not that people just shoot each other randomly. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=715.26s)]
*  It's usually precipitated by some kind of threat. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=717.14s)]
*  I would say not. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=719.3s)]
*  No, I think when you think about honor, think about whether or not, as Dov Cohen talks about, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=722.54s)]
*  your self-worth is negotiable with other people. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=727.72s)]
*  In honor cultures, your self-worth is constantly negotiated with others. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=730.42s)]
*  When people insult you, it's as if they've just stolen some of your self-worth. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=733.7s)]
*  In dignity cultures, what Dov Cohen calls, which I think characterized Silicon Valley, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=738.46s)]
*  if someone insults you, it's painful, but it doesn't mean that you have just been, your [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=742.86s)]
*  worth has been stolen. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=746.7s)]
*  And that's how I differentiate honor cultures from other types of cultures. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=748.38s)]
*  It's not as though people liked being insulted in any context, but in some contexts that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=751.82s)]
*  carries a lot of weight for your sense of self-worth. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=756.38s)]
*  My colleague Garrett Jones is a big fan of what he calls the deep roots literature, namely [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=759.38s)]
*  the notion that cultural traits are extremely persistent, possibly even for centuries, but [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=764.0s)]
*  at least for generations. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=768.9s)]
*  So your notions of tightness and looseness, how much do they persist over time, at least [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=770.5s)]
*  assuming the set of people living in a given territory is staying more or less the same? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=774.58s)]
*  I think that tight loose is a dynamic construct, that what we can see, and I've collected data [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=779.38s)]
*  after, for example, the Boston bombing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=784.9s)]
*  And after that event happened, we could see immediate tightening in Boston, people wanting [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=787.06s)]
*  stronger rules, people starting to get skeptical of outsiders. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=791.68s)]
*  We've seen this in the laboratory. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=794.86s)]
*  I can convince people at Maryland that they're living in an environment like Singapore that [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=795.86s)]
*  has like 20,000 people per square mile. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=799.36s)]
*  That activation of threat can make people immediately tighter and wanting stronger rules, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=802.02s)]
*  wanting stronger leaders. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=807.0999999999999s)]
*  But if the threat is not chronic, if it's not perpetuated, then I think we go back to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=808.62s)]
*  the attractor that we're used to in dynamical systems theory. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=812.86s)]
*  So it's not as though it can't change, but in order to actually have a gigantic change [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=817.0600000000001s)]
*  in tightness, you need to have either a very strong top-down threat that's persistent or [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=821.02s)]
*  different people that have now entered the system. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  And that's something that doesn't happen that much. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=829.58s)]
*  So that's why I think it's relatively stable. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=831.64s)]
*  But say China does not in a major way threaten Japan, and the Japanese population continues [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=833.38s)]
*  to shrink, and you end up with 50 million people living in what we now call Japan. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=838.5s)]
*  What's your sense of the speed of adjustment? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=843.06s)]
*  Japan will then become a much looser culture? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=845.14s)]
*  And how long does that take? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=847.28s)]
*  Is it more like 20 years, 200 years, or how do you think about that? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=848.28s)]
*  I think that someone like Joe Henrik might argue that it would take a long time, several [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=851.96s)]

*  I think that people through socialization, through social learning, are trained to act [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=857.76s)]
*  as though, to train to follow the norms of their previous generations. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=862.3s)]
*  Ron Engelhardt also talks about change takes a long time, in his data, over years and years [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=865.42s)]
*  to happen, and that this is not something that we can witness, change happening overnight. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=871.74s)]
*  So you mention in your book that population density in the year 1500 has fairly high predictive [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=876.46s)]
*  power. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=881.3s)]
*  What does it predict? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=882.3s)]
*  It predicts tightness. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=883.3s)]
*  So imagine you're living in Singapore, which I'm sure you've visited. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=884.3s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=887.66s)]
*  20,000 people per square mile. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=888.66s)]
*  It makes sense to ban gum, large quantities of gum in that context. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=890.08s)]
*  That's exactly what Lee Kuan Yew did. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=893.26s)]
*  He's kind of a brilliant cultural psychologist, in my point of view. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=894.98s)]
*  He assessed the level of threat the Singapore experienced, both ecologically and in terms [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=898.1800000000001s)]
*  of diversity, having many different cultural groups. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=902.16s)]
*  And he decided we have to have tight rules here. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=905.1s)]
*  He actually talks about it in his autobiography. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=906.9s)]
*  And the gum issues are interesting. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=909.34s)]
*  He basically saw people in this very crowded context were taking their gum, throwing on [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=910.9200000000001s)]
*  the ground. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=914.58s)]
*  It was causing a national mess. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=915.58s)]
*  So overnight, he sort of said, guys, we've got to ban gum. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  You wouldn't find that New Zealand that has 50 people per square mile. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=919.5s)]
*  When you have a lot of people per square mile, you need rules to help you coordinate, to [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=922.56s)]
*  avoid chaos. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=926.0s)]
*  But isn't Singapore evidence of low persistence, though? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=927.0s)]
*  Because in the 1950s, sanitation levels were pretty low in Singapore. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=929.68s)]
*  Early in the 20th century, it wasn't even that well populated. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=934.04s)]
*  So Lee Kuan Yew comes. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=937.4799999999999s)]
*  He makes a lot of big changes. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  It seems to show you can change the equilibrium pretty readily if you do the right thing. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=940.28s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=944.1199999999999s)]
*  He did. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=945.1199999999999s)]
*  He was a very good example of a top-down influence that was very much deliberate and it was very [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=946.1199999999999s)]
*  systematic. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=951.0799999999999s)]
*  And in that particular case, I think he's a good example of when cultural change can [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=952.08s)]
*  happen, when it's deliberate, when it's top-down, and when it's necessary. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=954.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, in Singapore, there's good reasons why you have to sacrifice liberty for security, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=958.2800000000001s)]
*  given the context. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=963.24s)]
*  One of my readers wrote to me and suggested, correctly or not, that about 70% of the variation [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=964.6s)]
*  in a people's values can be explained by wealth. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=970.48s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=972.9200000000001s)]
*  Just this one variable, wealth, much more important than anything else, true or false? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=974.08s)]
*  I would say that wealth is obviously very important. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=978.44s)]
*  It predicts in the collectivism literature high levels of group orientation. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=981.8399999999999s)]
*  In our data, we don't find any direct connection between GDP per capita and tightness. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=985.8399999999999s)]
*  You have very tight cultures that are wealthy, like Singapore and Japan, and you have very [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=991.1199999999999s)]
*  loose cultures that struggle. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=995.76s)]
*  So in our data, actually, what we can see is that there's no real main effect of GDP [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=998.04s)]
*  on the strength of norms. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1004.28s)]
*  But doesn't that mean, though, if there's no correlation, that both tightness and looseness, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1005.28s)]
*  in some way, they don't work? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1009.38s)]
*  Looseness doesn't get you more innovation. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1010.68s)]
*  Tightness doesn't get you more order. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1013.16s)]
*  So are they then a kind of epiphenomenon, sort of how people answer questions or how [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1014.9599999999999s)]
*  they set their clocks and synchronization, but they don't really drive what people actually [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  care about in the country, which is wealth? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1023.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think actually what we find in our data is a curvilinear effect of GDP. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1025.04s)]
*  So extremely loose and extremely tight cultures, both have low GDP, they have low happiness, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1030.46s)]
*  they have higher instability. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1036.28s)]
*  This kind of Goldilocks principle is very important when it comes to the strength of [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1038.02s)]
*  norms that groups might need to veer tight or loose based on their ecologies, but as [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1041.9s)]
*  they get more extreme and for different reasons, they wind up being unsuccessful, both in terms [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1045.9s)]
*  of monetary wealth, but also in terms of their happiness. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1050.92s)]
*  Very, very tight cultures tend to be very oppressive. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1054.18s)]
*  And what Durkheim would say, they want to escape from this kind of oppression, but very, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1056.58s)]
*  very loose cultures, those usually which are coming from very autocratic contexts that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1060.58s)]
*  have dismantled like the Ukraine, they tend to experience a lot of enemy, as Durkheim [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1065.1s)]
*  would say, and total disorder unpredictability, and they're not sustainable either. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1069.62s)]
*  This principle of too much or too little constraint, I think is applicable to many domains. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1074.1399999999999s)]
*  It relates to free speech, it relates to the brain. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1079.1399999999999s)]
*  When the brain is too synchronized or too little synchronized, it produces different [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1081.84s)]
*  brain disorders. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1085.06s)]
*  When we have too little choice or too much choice, it produces a lot of problems. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1086.34s)]
*  When we have too many rules or too free rules when raising our children, it produces problems. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1090.24s)]
*  So this principle of having a balance in terms of the strength of norms, I think, is important. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1094.06s)]
*  And that's why I think wealth is important, but it's not determinant of human behavior. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1099.74s)]
*  Your broad view, norms are actually not very functional. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1104.02s)]
*  They may try to do certain things. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1106.98s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1108.62s)]
*  But they fail. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1109.62s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1110.62s)]
*  I think the extreme nature of norms is problematic. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1111.62s)]
*  We need norms. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1114.2s)]
*  We can't operate without norms. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1115.2s)]
*  We wake up from the moment we get up in the morning to the moment you go back to bed. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1116.98s)]
*  We have been following norms, thousands of norms. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1121.26s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1124.06s)]
*  You need some norms, but a particular pattern of norms as defined in terms of its tightness [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1125.06s)]
*  or looseness. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1129.12s)]
*  It won't make you wealthier. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1130.12s)]
*  It won't make you happier as long as you avoid the extremes. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1131.66s)]
*  So within a broad range, the norm at the macro level, it has particular effects. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1134.82s)]
*  But again, the things people care about, wealth and happiness, it fails to deliver or not. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1138.98s)]
*  I think people don't just care. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1143.1s)]
*  Well, actually, I'll say that again, the extremes are what produce the problems. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1144.98s)]
*  When we look at groups that are tight and they're not extreme, they provide a lot of [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  things that people need. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1153.3000000000002s)]
*  They provide a lot of order. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1154.3000000000002s)]
*  They provide a lot of synchrony. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1155.8000000000002s)]
*  Synchrony is really important as a very basic phenomenon, feeling like you're aligned with [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1156.8000000000002s)]
*  others. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1161.46s)]
*  It produces a lot of cooperation, but it also has a detriment of creativity. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1162.46s)]
*  Looseness, when it's not too extreme, makes people really creative. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1166.18s)]
*  It makes people really open and to different people. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1170.0600000000002s)]
*  So there are definitely huge advantages to both tightness and looseness, depending on [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1172.98s)]
*  your vantage point. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1176.5s)]
*  Now, you mentioned Joe Henrik before. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1177.58s)]
*  He has this idea of what he calls weird psychology. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1179.26s)]
*  And weird is an acronym for Western educated, industrialized, rich, democratic. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1182.46s)]
*  And I think, as I understand his view, people who are weird are just fundamentally different [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1187.7s)]
*  in terms of their norms. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1191.86s)]
*  There's not some kind of spectrum or continuum. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1193.34s)]
*  There's simply a fundamental break in human civilization. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1195.3s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1198.62s)]
*  Or what's your perspective on weird? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1199.62s)]
*  I don't. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1200.62s)]
*  I would say that this idea of weird predates years and years of psychology. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1201.62s)]
*  The reason why cross-cultural psychology developed in the first place is because people were [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1207.06s)]
*  really concerned that American psychology was based on very strange samples that is [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1210.22s)]
*  ignoring 70% of the world. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1214.82s)]
*  So this weird idea has been with us for a long time. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1216.74s)]
*  I would say that, no, there's not this discontinuous nature where there's one society that's so [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1220.1399999999999s)]
*  unusual. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1226.1399999999999s)]
*  The difference in the United States from other cultures is in the type of individualism that [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1227.1399999999999s)]
*  we endorse. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1230.5s)]
*  We're not just focused on privacy and on independence. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1231.62s)]
*  We're focused on what I call vertical individualism, and that's competitive individualism. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1234.98s)]
*  That is different than other Western cultures like Scandinavia, Australia, that are much [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1239.3400000000001s)]
*  more horizontal in their individualism. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1243.3400000000001s)]
*  So the weirdness of the United States, in many ways, is its form of individualism. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1245.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think that there's a lot of ways we can examine cultural constructs and find variation [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1249.2600000000002s)]
*  around the world. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1253.98s)]
*  But we don't in this country actually seem all that rational to me in the way that weird [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1254.98s)]
*  might predict. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1259.2600000000002s)]
*  General question about what we can never know about culture. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1260.6200000000001s)]
*  So as you know, a lot of people who work in areas with large numbers of data points and [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1263.86s)]
*  well-specified models, they're very critical of cross-cultural papers because they think [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1268.6599999999999s)]
*  we don't really know the true model, we can't write it down. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1272.9399999999998s)]
*  There are all these big interaction effects at the macro level, we're not sure how to [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1276.1s)]
*  trace them. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1279.4599999999998s)]
*  Maybe the tests have low statistical power, or it's hard to come up with causal tests [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1280.4599999999998s)]
*  at all. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1284.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what's your response to those kind of criticisms? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1285.8999999999999s)]
*  Is your view, well, they're misunderstanding the econometrics. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1288.26s)]
*  Is this is actually as good as a lot of other empirical work? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1292.32s)]
*  Or is your view, well, we know culture is important. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1295.72s)]
*  It's like either this or the anthropologists. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1298.36s)]
*  And this is telling us something. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1300.6799999999998s)]
*  How do you place yourself in this debate on cross-cultural econometrics? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1302.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1306.96s)]
*  I think that every method that any of us use is very limited in what we can say about any [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1308.4399999999998s)]
*  particular study. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1314.9399999999998s)]
*  I've always been a big fan of theory, is testing theory with as many methods as humanly possible. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1316.0s)]
*  But that's how I sort of think about cross-cultural psychology. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1322.52s)]
*  We can't take one paper that has 35 nations and come to any massive conclusion about that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1324.8s)]
*  or strong conclusion about that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1331.56s)]
*  We have to then try to replicate that theory with other methods, whether it's using computational [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1333.04s)]
*  models, using neuroscience, looking to traditional societies with totally different methods. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1337.08s)]
*  We just spent a couple of years coding over 100 samples in terms of the strength of norms [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1342.04s)]
*  in various different domains with ethnographies. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1346.68s)]
*  And I'm really curious to see with my work, can I see the theory replicating with different [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1349.4s)]
*  types of methods? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1354.48s)]
*  My group at Maryland is really fiercely interdisciplinary because we want to bring in methods that can [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1355.92s)]
*  help us replicate theory. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1360.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's my sort of approach to these issues, given that any particular study is going to [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1361.8200000000002s)]
*  be flawed in many ways. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  Your own work aside, what would be a few generalizations about culture that you think we've learned [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1367.16s)]
*  empirically and follow from theory that you more or less agree with or believe in? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1372.0s)]
*  I would say that we've learned that culture is not random, that it evolves for semi-adaptive [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1375.84s)]
*  reasons given the kinds of environments that people place. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean all cultural traits, values, norms have been adaptive, but many are. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1384.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think people don't realize that cultures are not just accidental, that there's some [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1389.76s)]
*  rationale to cultural differences. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1395.24s)]
*  And actually, once we realize that and we can start to document that, I think it produces [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1397.28s)]
*  a lot more empathy when you're traveling, when you're learning about other cultures, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1401.8s)]
*  when you start to think, wait, if I lived in that context, whether it's the US South [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1406.32s)]
*  or whether it's in Sri Lanka or wherever it is or Japan, that you also would likely support [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1410.48s)]
*  the norms and values that are being cultivated if they were helpful for your survival. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1416.98s)]
*  So I tend to think about cultures being quasi-rational. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1420.8s)]
*  How bad is the replication crisis in social psychology? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1424.96s)]
*  It relates not so much to your work, but it's become a big issue. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1427.76s)]
*  What's your view? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1431.08s)]
*  I'm actually really proud of what psychology is doing. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1432.08s)]
*  I think that transparency is really important. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1435.0s)]
*  I think best practice is identifying them important. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1438.0s)]
*  I'm really excited about this revolution, we would call it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1440.4399999999998s)]
*  I would say that cross-cultural psychologists are not too unfamiliar with this kind of replication [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1443.72s)]
*  crisis because for years and years, we know that when you try to replicate something, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1448.04s)]
*  even in a different state, let alone another country, you are going to be dealing with [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1453.0s)]
*  of rival hypotheses, whether it's different instructions, interpretation of the instructions [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1458.0400000000002s)]
*  or different motivations of the subjects, the interactions with the experimenter, they're [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1462.5600000000002s)]
*  all things that can produce no effects or they can dramatically change your effects. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1465.88s)]
*  And we're in the business, cross-cultural psychologists, of having problems replicating [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1470.3600000000001s)]
*  basic American findings for many, many years. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1474.0400000000002s)]
*  And I think what's interesting is that what you see in the replication crisis and the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1477.48s)]
*  recent PNAS paper that the papers that didn't replicate very well were read by other scientists [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1481.24s)]
*  is having a lot of contextual factors that might weigh in on them. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1486.32s)]
*  And so I think it's really important as we go through the replication crisis to kind [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1490.8s)]
*  of think about that we're trying to replicate things and we have to understand that if they're [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1494.72s)]
*  very much influenced by the social context, there's a risk that they won't be replicated. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1499.8799999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean that the theory doesn't matter. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1503.8s)]
*  I think the risk, and I'll talk a couple of seconds about the replication crisis risks, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1506.96s)]
*  is that people will throw out the theory with the bathwater, whatever the metaphor might [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1512.08s)]
*  be, that we're in this business now of just seeing can we replicate this in one other [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1515.92s)]
*  context. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1520.48s)]
*  As just an example, there was an attempt to replicate some kind of race relations question [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1521.48s)]
*  that was done in LA in Italy. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1525.5600000000002s)]
*  Now that to me as a cross-cultural psychologist is silly, but it could also be that we try [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1527.72s)]
*  to replicate something in Kansas. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1531.3200000000002s)]
*  It might be different. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1532.68s)]
*  So people, I think, need to be collaborative as they seek to replicate to understand the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1533.76s)]
*  social context in which the phenomenon has been tested and make sure when things don't [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1538.42s)]
*  replicate that there might be a good reason why it hasn't replicated. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1542.3600000000001s)]
*  As you mentioned before, in your work there's a notion that fear of outsiders or natural [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1545.6s)]
*  disasters or a sense of threat, it can make a culture tighter. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1549.9399999999998s)]
*  Now Jonathan Haidt and some other researchers, they've talked about how a sense of disgust [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1553.6399999999999s)]
*  can make personal moral views in some way more conservative or arguably tighter. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1558.24s)]
*  Do you think this is ultimately the same phenomenon or are they two separate mechanisms here? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1562.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a great question. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1567.36s)]
*  I think that they're two separate mechanisms. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1568.8s)]
*  Disgust is not necessarily an emotion that relates to fear, but both might relate to [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1571.16s)]
*  needing stronger rules in order to coordinate behavior in those contexts. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1576.8000000000002s)]
*  So disease threat or pathogen threat usually is something that could be related to disgust, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1580.8400000000001s)]
*  but that's different than the fear of invasion. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1586.0400000000002s)]
*  Fear of invasion is not activating disgust. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1588.8200000000002s)]
*  It's activating something that where you feel as a collective that you need to coordinate [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  your action to face that threat. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1595.66s)]
*  But how people respond to a pandemic when they come. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1597.52s)]
*  It looks a lot like a war, right? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1600.3s)]
*  You have quarantines, you have people band together, there's a fair amount of central [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1602.4199999999998s)]
*  planning. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1605.74s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't think it activates disgust. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1606.74s)]
*  I would say the same thing with natural disasters. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1608.3s)]
*  If we're worried about a natural disaster happening at Maryland, we don't start feeling [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1609.82s)]
*  disgusted. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1613.78s)]
*  We feel fear. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1614.78s)]
*  But they might both produce, and we have seen that pathogens produce tightness as in both [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1616.1s)]
*  the lab and also in the field. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1621.94s)]
*  We see that other threats that require coordination also produce tightness, but they're not mediated [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1624.18s)]
*  through feelings of disgust. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1629.82s)]
*  How do the categories of loose and tight map onto traditional gender roles? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1631.82s)]
*  Is there a gender based difference, say, in how people respond to fear or a sense of threat? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1635.86s)]
*  I haven't actually seen many much evidence for gender differences in response to threat. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1640.74s)]
*  I will say that women, minorities, people of lower social power tend to live in tighter [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1646.3799999999999s)]
*  worlds. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1651.98s)]
*  So that is how I think about the connection of gender and race to tightness. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1652.98s)]
*  Actually, I think that in the past, we've kind of thought about power is allowing people [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1657.98s)]
*  to violate norms and to have a lot of latitude. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1663.4199999999998s)]
*  And that's a looseness phenomenon. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1666.8s)]
*  People who are in high power positions live in looser worlds. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1668.86s)]
*  They're not as accountable, whereas people in lower social statuses are much more accountable. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1671.1399999999999s)]
*  They have to be worried about rule violations to a much greater extent. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1677.02s)]
*  So that might produce more of a prevention oriented mentality as mediated by having to [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1680.58s)]
*  survive those tight environments. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1685.4399999999998s)]
*  Is Steven Pinker correct that human progress is improving basic culture basically all the time? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1687.34s)]
*  I agree with Steven a lot on sort of how much we've come in terms of threat. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1692.02s)]
*  If you compare hundreds of years ago, the kinds of things we experienced. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1698.3799999999999s)]
*  I disagree with him, though, in the sense that I think that we have to be mindful of [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1702.1399999999999s)]
*  looming threats, things like climate change. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1706.06s)]
*  There are certain threats like violence that have been dramatically reduced, but there's [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1708.54s)]
*  other collective threats that we have to be mindful of. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1713.1799999999998s)]
*  Are cultures in general becoming tighter or looser over time? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1716.1s)]
*  I mean, many people would think that they're becoming looser, but actually you could see [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1718.8999999999999s)]
*  here in the US that lots of evidence that we see tightening in the United States. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1722.5s)]
*  I don't think it's a healthy tightening per se. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1727.6999999999998s)]
*  I think it's involving a lot of fake threat or exaggerated threat. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1729.6999999999998s)]
*  I think the confluence of leaders that are activating threat as well as social media [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1734.02s)]
*  that amplifies threats and people pay attention to these threats. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1738.4199999999998s)]
*  This is the availability heuristic, as you know, in cognitive science. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1741.76s)]
*  When we hear about an immigrant who has just shot someone, it's very salient to us, much [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1744.46s)]
*  more salient than another person in another state who is an American citizen shooting [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1750.3400000000001s)]
*  their whole family. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1754.52s)]
*  And so we over exaggerate these threats. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1755.78s)]
*  And as a result, it produces the desire for stronger rules and strong leaders. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1757.6200000000001s)]
*  So I think that looseness ebbs and flows. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1761.88s)]
*  And I think it depends on the perceived or actual level of threat in the environment. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1764.4s)]
*  Geographic cross state mobility is down about 50% from its postwar peak in this country. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1769.06s)]
*  How is that changing our culture? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1773.66s)]
*  I think mobility is a really critical aspect of tight loose in the sense that when you [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1775.14s)]
*  have lower mobility, you have less exposure to differences in opinions, differences in [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1780.8200000000002s)]
*  traditions and it tends to promote tightness, reinforces tightness. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1785.18s)]
*  Lots of mobility affords looseness. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1788.8600000000001s)]
*  And we've seen that empirically. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1791.16s)]
*  And we know that mobility in some of our computational models is really infecting ethnocentrism. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1792.5800000000002s)]
*  In Axelrod's famous paper on the evolution of ethnocentrism, he would argue that ethnocentrism [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1798.16s)]
*  is inevitable. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1803.62s)]
*  But actually in our data, we could see that high mobile context actually are much less [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1804.62s)]
*  ethnocentric. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1808.6599999999999s)]
*  So mobility is really part and parcel of looseness. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1809.6599999999999s)]
*  How much does it matter if at all that so much of the Western world is now post-Christian [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1813.34s)]
*  for social norms such as tightness and looseness? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1818.1799999999998s)]
*  Do we fear different things because we're not so religious anymore? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1821.06s)]
*  I can't really speak to the religious differences. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1824.1s)]
*  What I can say is that when people feel threatened, they tend to desire different aspects of God [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1827.1799999999998s)]
*  from our research. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1833.62s)]
*  They want a more tight monitoring punishing God in our research when they feel threatened [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1834.86s)]
*  by natural disasters or conflict. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1839.42s)]
*  So I think that even religion is both a source of tightness, but it could be affected by [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1841.9s)]
*  the ecology in which people are embedded. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1846.94s)]
*  What was it like for you when you moved from New York State to Champaign-Urbana for your [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1849.1s)]
*  graduate work? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1852.82s)]
*  It was culture shock. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1855.7s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1857.38s)]
*  I went to a small school for undergrad upstate New York at Colgate and I was really looking [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1858.38s)]
*  forward to being in a city. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1862.88s)]
*  And when I heard about Harry Trandis and his work and I thought, oh my gosh, I'd love to [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1864.3200000000002s)]
*  work with him and got in there, it was devastating to have to go live in another small town. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1868.24s)]
*  But I would say that it was the most amazing graduate experience mainly because of the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1873.1200000000001s)]
*  interdisciplinarity of the context. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1878.4s)]
*  So I got over the culture shock relatively quickly. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1880.3600000000001s)]
*  But what surprised you the most about actually living in Champaign-Urbana? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1883.68s)]
*  I would say the politeness. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1888.4s)]
*  In our research, loose states are very rude and tight states are more polite, more normabiding. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1890.56s)]
*  And I'm someone who's used to kind of flipping people off as a friendly gesture. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1896.96s)]
*  And New Yorkers are known for interrupting people. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1901.6s)]
*  And I have a lot of relatives in the Midwest, so we've negotiated these differences in culture [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1904.44s)]
*  over the years. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1909.8s)]
*  But that was probably the biggest shock. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1911.12s)]
*  Also just the general geography, it was very flat and very different than upstate New York. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1912.9199999999998s)]
*  Do tight or loose cultures scapegoat more? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  Take someone from within the community, consider them to be in some way at fault, correctly [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1921.48s)]
*  or not. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1926.56s)]
*  Treat them as a sacrificial victim, which is done very often in American political culture. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1927.56s)]
*  And act an ongoing ritual through which that victim falls and then the community feels [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1932.96s)]
*  cleansed as a result. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1937.56s)]
*  A la Renée Girard. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1938.8s)]
*  I would suspect that tight cultures do have more of that kind of phenomenon. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1940.12s)]
*  Because people who are different are seen as dangerous. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1944.1s)]
*  We actually had students go around the world in tight and loose cultures wearing even something [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1946.6799999999998s)]
*  as minor as a facial stigma, like I brought them warts to wear on their face or tattoos [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1950.84s)]
*  where they were wearing nose rings. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1955.36s)]
*  And we asked them to seek help in city streets or in malls. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1956.6s)]
*  And in the tightest of cultures, people were helped much less. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1959.3999999999999s)]
*  They were really much less friendly to them and much less helpful as compared to loose [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1962.48s)]
*  cultures. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1967.24s)]
*  And I think in small communities, when someone is threatening the social order, then scapegoating [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1968.24s)]
*  is possibly a response to that. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1971.84s)]
*  What do you think of five factor personality theory as a psychologist? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1975.52s)]
*  How good is it? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1977.8s)]
*  I would say it's an approximation to try to explain lots of variation as a cross-cultural [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1978.8s)]
*  psychologist. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1984.72s)]
*  I would say that it's not necessarily the only personality dimensions that are relevant [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1985.72s)]
*  around the world. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1991.48s)]
*  There's some researcher in China that suggests that there's a sixth dimension of interpersonal [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1992.48s)]
*  relatedness that hasn't been found with the big five factor. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1996.24s)]
*  This is what's so exciting about cross-cultural research. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=1999.48s)]
*  When you generate theory and research in one context, it doesn't mean that you're not [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2001.72s)]
*  deficient in that theory. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2005.68s)]
*  And you have to go to other cultures to think, well, do we need a six factor? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2007.3600000000001s)]
*  Or what might be contaminating about those factors in other cultures? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2010.76s)]
*  Maybe some of these dimensions are not as relevant in other cultures. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2013.8400000000001s)]
*  So the construct space itself is what we're trying to really look at in cross-cultural [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2016.44s)]
*  research. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2021.2s)]
*  But I think the big five have been replicated. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2022.2s)]
*  I do think there is a lot to be said about it. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2024.1200000000001s)]
*  But I think that there's some variation around the world that would suggest additional dimensions [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2026.72s)]
*  are relevant. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2030.78s)]
*  If you could have data on something for your research that you don't have data on right [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2031.78s)]
*  now to satisfy your curiosity, what would that data be? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2035.66s)]
*  I would say it would be data from thousands of years ago in terms of societal norms and [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2039.22s)]
*  ecology. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2046.1399999999999s)]
*  And in fact, I'm teaming up with Peter Churchin, who I'm sure you know of, who's developed [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2047.1399999999999s)]
*  this fabulous database, Shishat. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2050.86s)]
*  And I'm trying to start to look at tight loose in the ancient record. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2054.22s)]
*  Let's say you could go back in time, a thousand years, to any place on earth. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2057.94s)]
*  There's no problem with disease. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2061.7s)]
*  And by definition, you're fluent in the language. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2063.46s)]
*  For your own curiosity and fun, where would you choose? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2065.64s)]
*  I think I would go and hang out with Herodotus. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2068.18s)]
*  Herodotus, why? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2070.9s)]
*  I think I would just like to be traveling around with him and noticing what he's noticing. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2072.1s)]
*  I think The Histories is one of the most fabulous books that is really the first text in cross-cultural [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2076.86s)]
*  psychology. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2081.46s)]
*  And I would like to really witness what he looked at. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2083.18s)]
*  I would also say if I had another second place, I'd like to go to Sparta. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2085.3s)]
*  Because Sparta is a very fascinating place, and even its neighbor Athens at the time, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2088.46s)]
*  to kind of contrast the strength of norms that we see in those two contexts. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2092.9s)]
*  Now in the middle of these discussions, there's usually a segment, overrated versus underrated. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2097.38s)]
*  And I'll toss out some names of things, and you're free to pass on any one of them. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2102.46s)]
*  But please give us your opinion. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2106.34s)]
*  First and foremost, Bethesda, Maryland, overrated or underrated? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2108.0200000000004s)]
*  I would say properly rated. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2113.22s)]
*  I think that Bethesda is a thriving place. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2116.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of interesting restaurants. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2119.8199999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of emerging culture, jazz, and so forth. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2122.46s)]
*  So I wouldn't say it's really over or underrated. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2125.96s)]
*  For me, it's dull. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2128.5s)]
*  So I think it's overrated. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2129.5s)]
*  I would much rather live in Silver Spring or College Park or anywhere else in that part [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2130.62s)]
*  of Maryland than Bethesda. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2134.8999999999996s)]
*  I should say that as someone who lives in PG County, near College Park, that I do really [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2136.62s)]
*  love living in an extremely diverse environment at PG County. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2142.22s)]
*  I'm proud that my kids are in a context where they're learning about different cultures. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2145.3799999999997s)]
*  Now, I think you also learn a lot about the cultures in Bethesda as well. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2149.58s)]
*  I just think that you're more of a minority if you're a right Jewish kid when you're in [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2152.98s)]
*  PG County. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2157.02s)]
*  And the world looks very different. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2158.3399999999997s)]
*  And the way you think is affected by that. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2160.46s)]
*  And I'm glad that they've had that experience. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2163.54s)]
*  The TV show The Americans. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2165.94s)]
*  It's probably underrated. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2169.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm on episode 10 of season six right now. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2172.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm not a big TV fan. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2176.9s)]
*  I don't watch a lot of television. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2178.1800000000003s)]
*  But I started watching The Americans this summer and I was hooked by the first episode. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2179.7000000000003s)]
*  And it's just phenomenal. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2183.78s)]
*  I think it's underrated to the extent that everyone on this planet should watch that [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2185.5s)]
*  show. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2190.1400000000003s)]
*  What is interesting for the social scientist in that show? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2191.1400000000003s)]
*  I would say it's the ability to be inauthentic all the time. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2193.14s)]
*  Having to play a role, not just a dangerous role, but also just go against your inner [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2198.7799999999997s)]
*  instincts at all times. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2204.54s)]
*  I think it's also extremely interesting to watch the dynamics of the couple on this show [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2206.14s)]
*  in terms of their loyalty. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2209.58s)]
*  It's a tight loose issue. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2212.02s)]
*  I'm not going to get into details for the audience. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2213.02s)]
*  But you have one person who really wants to get rid of the allegiance, who questions what [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2215.22s)]
*  they're being told to do. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2220.9s)]
*  And another that for a very long time thinks, no, we're given an order. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2222.06s)]
*  We abide by it. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2227.1s)]
*  And that conflict is fascinating from a tight loose perspective. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2228.1s)]
*  Overrated or underrated? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2232.14s)]
*  Staten Island? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2233.14s)]
*  I would say probably underrated. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2234.14s)]
*  But that's because I actually am familiar with Staten Island. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2237.82s)]
*  We've had relatives that live there. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2239.86s)]
*  I think it's probably the last undiscovered place around the city. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2241.98s)]
*  Brooklyn has become kind of a she-she place to live, but Staten Island has not. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2246.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think, I mean, there's great delis there. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2250.06s)]
*  I've spent some time there. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2253.14s)]
*  My late mother is buried in Staten Island. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2254.7599999999998s)]
*  So I have a very fond feeling for that place. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2256.9s)]
*  Direct talk in negotiations? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2261.38s)]
*  Overrated. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2263.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2264.58s)]
*  It works very well in certain ecologies where cutting to the chase, where time is money, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2265.58s)]
*  where you're taught to be authentic, where face and honor are not that important as cultural [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2270.54s)]
*  constructs. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2276.46s)]
*  Again, it's important in certain contexts, but it's very much backfires in contexts where [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2277.62s)]
*  trying to maintain face, trying to signal respect to people is more important. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2282.62s)]
*  And therefore, more indirect communication is more relevant in those contexts. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2287.06s)]
*  So do Americans do too much direct talk when they negotiate? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2291.7200000000003s)]
*  I would say, as a generally speaking, no question about it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2294.7400000000002s)]
*  One of the biggest problems in negotiation is, again, it's around cultural intelligence. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2299.56s)]
*  It's taking our ways of doing things and just applying them around the world without [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2302.86s)]
*  thinking about, do these styles match the context? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2307.54s)]
*  There's a reason why these things work here, but they might not work in Egypt or in Japan. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2310.58s)]
*  And I think it's really important because we're training our students, our MBAs, our [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2315.94s)]
*  political scientists, our lawyers to adapt a certain style of negotiating that just doesn't [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2321.1800000000003s)]
*  work in other parts of the world. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2325.26s)]
*  Economics. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2326.94s)]
*  What's the biggest thing wrong with us? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2327.94s)]
*  You can be harsh. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2331.2200000000003s)]
*  I would say that economics can be somewhat a theoretical in the sense that psychologists [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2332.22s)]
*  are concerned with mediating mechanism. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2337.8999999999996s)]
*  What explains the phenomenon? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2340.02s)]
*  Whenever I've given a talk to economists and I try to open up the black box of what I'm [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2342.3399999999997s)]
*  talking about, they lose interest very quickly. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2347.1s)]
*  Why do you need to understand the mechanism? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2349.62s)]
*  Just give me the, you know, kind of the what the effects are. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2351.24s)]
*  I'm not saying all economists are like this. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2354.3399999999997s)]
*  And I've spent quite a bit of time with people up at Harvard, Nathan Nunn, other people that [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2355.9399999999996s)]
*  really do care about these things. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2360.06s)]
*  So I don't want to overgeneralize. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2361.58s)]
*  I also think experimental economics has another set of problems. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2363.22s)]
*  But now tell us, please. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2367.54s)]
*  Well, I think that a lot of it again is the strengths to it. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2369.1s)]
*  I like I've always admired the lack of deception that's used in experimental economics and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2373.1s)]
*  in psychology for a very long time, people felt okay with deceiving subjects because [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2378.2599999999998s)]
*  we had new subject pools that wouldn't be spoiled by that deception. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2382.7799999999997s)]
*  Nowadays, when you use mechanical Turk, the same people are engaging in studies. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2386.02s)]
*  We have to be concerned about this. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2389.6s)]
*  So I admire some parts of experimental economics. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2390.7s)]
*  And again, on the theory side, I'm a big proponent of theory. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2393.8599999999997s)]
*  And I think the theory comes first. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2397.58s)]
*  And a lot of times we just see these kind of effects happening that you can nudge people [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2399.2599999999998s)]
*  in this direction or that direction, how replicable there is a question. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2403.02s)]
*  But really, what's the underlying theory that's being tested, I think sometimes is open to [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2405.8199999999997s)]
*  question. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2410.2599999999998s)]
*  Other than yourself and Triandis, but who's a psychologist that economists should read [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2411.2599999999998s)]
*  more of, whom they don't? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2415.06s)]
*  Not just economists, but intelligent lay readers. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2416.7999999999997s)]
*  I would say someone like Joe McGrath. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2419.58s)]
*  He's deceased. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2422.38s)]
*  He was a big groups researcher at Illinois when I was there. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2423.38s)]
*  And he really created many circumplexes. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2426.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm always a big fan of the circumplex, whereby he can delineate what kind of tasks groups [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2428.94s)]
*  are engaged in, what kind of conflicts they might have. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2433.94s)]
*  I think he's a phenomenal theorist. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2437.68s)]
*  I also wrote a lot about research methods that would be useful, the judgments we have [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2439.74s)]
*  to make in research that he wrote about in several books. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2443.02s)]
*  Jordan Peterson is trying to resurrect the reputation of Carl Jung, who of course was [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2446.78s)]
*  a psychologist. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2450.94s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2452.1000000000004s)]
*  Probably not a good idea. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2453.1000000000004s)]
*  Why not? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2454.1000000000004s)]
*  Maybe the ideas that he had, but the methods or the test of those ideas would need to be [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2456.1000000000004s)]
*  really approached very differently. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2460.02s)]
*  How much of Freud has held up? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2463.1200000000003s)]
*  I would say not a whole lot, although some of his very big ideas really were not noticed [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2465.2200000000003s)]
*  as much. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2469.5800000000004s)]
*  I think his ideas about how societal constraints affect psychopathology are really interesting. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2470.9s)]
*  I read about it in the book. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2476.42s)]
*  Could you give us an example of that? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2477.42s)]
*  Just the kind of neuroses he would argue when people feel that they have to abide by a lot [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2480.1s)]
*  of strong norms. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2483.7400000000002s)]
*  I think he was conflicted also about how do we create a balance between freedom and constraint. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2485.2200000000003s)]
*  And that kind of idea he picked up on in Civilization and its discontents, but it hasn't been really [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2489.7000000000003s)]
*  something that people talk about a lot. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2495.58s)]
*  In general, in the history of psychology, are there unmind insights in the history of [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2497.98s)]
*  psychological thought, or is virtually all of it incorporated into the contemporary wisdom? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2502.14s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2506.98s)]
*  I really think that there's so much about history that psychologists ignore. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2507.98s)]
*  And this is not just psychologists. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2512.2599999999998s)]
*  It's in any discipline. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2514.42s)]
*  If anything, our science should be more historical. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2516.22s)]
*  It should be trying to address questions that are not just relevant right now, but to the [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2519.04s)]
*  past, and that it will inform our methods now to think about history and evolution. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2522.98s)]
*  And that's why I start to team up with people who are studying history to try to test questions [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2528.08s)]
*  that are informing now with previous behavior. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2531.98s)]
*  We almost act as though life started here now in the 21st century. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2535.0s)]
*  One of the problems I think also in the science, the sociology of science and psychology, is [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2539.1s)]
*  that we're getting much more ahistorical, even in our science. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2542.38s)]
*  The length of journals makes it such that people don't review literature that happened [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2545.7400000000002s)]
*  50, 60 years ago, even in the science. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2549.66s)]
*  And I think it's a big problem. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2551.54s)]
*  And that we need to make sure that our theories are not just getting rehashed because people [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2553.38s)]
*  don't know what happened 60 years ago. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2556.98s)]
*  Part of that is some of the practices and journals, but part of it is that people want [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2559.14s)]
*  to create something sometimes that maybe is old wine and new bottles. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2562.9s)]
*  Do social psychologists have anything to teach CEOs about management? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2567.14s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2570.9s)]
*  What? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2571.9s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2572.9s)]
*  I mean, a lot of management, you know, people, I teach executives, I teach negotiation, mainly [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2573.9s)]
*  in Beijing for the Smith School. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2578.74s)]
*  And you know, what happens with MBA students in general is that they want to learn about [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2580.3799999999997s)]
*  finance and accounting. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2584.66s)]
*  And it's only later when they become older that they realize, you know what, I really [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2585.66s)]
*  need to understand human behavior. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2589.54s)]
*  That's the stuff that's really difficult, is how to manage, how to lead, how to motivate, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2591.14s)]
*  how to manage conflict. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2595.8999999999996s)]
*  Like, these are the critical skills that managers need. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2596.8999999999996s)]
*  They can learn those other skills pretty easily, but they need psychology to understand how [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2599.68s)]
*  to actually deal with human behavior. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2603.24s)]
*  So say I'm a CEO and I want an entry point into understanding academic psychology as [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2605.3799999999997s)]
*  a research enterprise. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2610.1s)]
*  Where and how should I start? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2611.8599999999997s)]
*  I think in terms of your education, how you would get educated. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2613.5s)]
*  Well, there's some great textbooks that you can learn in organizational behavior. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2617.34s)]
*  People don't respond well to textbooks. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2621.34s)]
*  I would say maybe Harvard Business Review. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2623.62s)]
*  Harvard Business Review. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2625.66s)]
*  I think that there's some really smart, accessible types of papers that come out in HBR that [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2626.66s)]
*  help people to understand human behavior, give real world examples of how they apply. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2631.34s)]
*  I've been just writing about, for example, Elon Musk and some of his problems and how [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2635.26s)]
*  they reflect his genius, his looseness, but how much he needs to tighten up that operation. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2639.46s)]
*  We write about mergers and acquisitions and how they succeed or fail and the kind of cultural [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2645.06s)]
*  factors that managers and CEOs should know about. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2649.44s)]
*  You would think that in those contexts, they would understand and do cultural due diligence [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2652.1400000000003s)]
*  before they sort of get married with other companies, but they don't. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2656.26s)]
*  And so HBR helps people to understand the principles, the scientific principles that [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2659.2200000000003s)]
*  inform management, but in the context where they're given real world examples. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2663.44s)]
*  Is academia a tight or a loose culture? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2667.62s)]
*  I would say that it's pretty tight. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2669.94s)]
*  The replication crisis in particular, I think, is making it even tighter. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2672.9s)]
*  That's another possible downside of the movement in the sense that it gets personal. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2676.88s)]
*  People sometimes are accusing people of things that are reflecting their intent. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2682.46s)]
*  And this is making people more cautious, or it might make people more cautious. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2688.44s)]
*  It might actually inhibit creativity if it's not something that we develop norms of civility [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2691.14s)]
*  for. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2696.62s)]
*  I've seen it happen with many people who, because of the loose nature of the internet, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2697.62s)]
*  which itself has a lot of advantages, but also is a cesspool of antinormative behavior, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2701.54s)]
*  it promotes a lot of problems when it comes to reputations and therefore might limit creativity. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2707.14s)]
*  How did academia become such a tight culture? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2713.7799999999997s)]
*  Is it that it feels under threat? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2715.98s)]
*  Does it have some notion of population density, but in kind of intellectual space? [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2717.74s)]
*  Or what's the transmission mechanism? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2722.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2724.02s)]
*  I would say, by the way, I think disciplines vary in terms of their tightness. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2725.22s)]
*  So I wouldn't say that we can define all academia as tight. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2727.98s)]
*  But I think that because of the tenure process, because sometimes the demands of the task [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2731.7799999999997s)]
*  can actually cause tighter loose to evolve. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2736.22s)]
*  When you need to get tenure, when you are being evaluated and monitored, that tends [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2738.98s)]
*  to produce a tight mentality. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2744.2599999999998s)]
*  It tends to produce some elements of risk aversion. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2746.4599999999996s)]
*  And that, again, could limit creativity. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2749.9399999999996s)]
*  I tend to, for whatever reason, and of course now I'm a full professor, but even when I [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2751.98s)]
*  was assistant professor, I thought if I'm going to be in this job, I want to do something [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2756.34s)]
*  that's risky, that's interesting. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2759.62s)]
*  And I try to encourage my students to do that, to think big, to not be inhibited by the journal [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2762.62s)]
*  space or what might be expected. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2767.38s)]
*  That incremental contributions are not nearly as interesting as big contributions, even [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2770.82s)]
*  if you've failed a lot, which we all do. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2774.98s)]
*  Now you're well known for your work on negotiation. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2777.62s)]
*  Why are women worse negotiators than men, if indeed they are? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2780.22s)]
*  I don't know where that comes from, because meta-analyses would say that when there are [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2783.18s)]
*  gender differences, they tend to be pretty small. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2787.8599999999997s)]
*  That is to say that situational factors really do affect behavior and outcomes in negotiation [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2789.74s)]
*  a lot. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2795.74s)]
*  And so there's not huge differences in gender. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2796.74s)]
*  What I do find that differentiates women and men in general, but this is again delimiting [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2798.98s)]
*  it further, white women of a certain social class compared to white men, is that women [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2803.7799999999997s)]
*  are less likely to get to the negotiation table. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2809.7s)]
*  So we can think about putting people in the lab and having them negotiate and studying [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2812.18s)]
*  their behavior, but we can think about who gets to the table in the first place, is what [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2815.1s)]
*  we call propensity to negotiate. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2818.14s)]
*  And we started this research program with Linda Babcock. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2820.16s)]
*  She's an economist at Carnegie Mellon. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2821.8999999999996s)]
*  And we can see that women actually are less likely to ask for things than men. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2823.6s)]
*  Men get to the negotiation table more often. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2827.46s)]
*  And so we've been studying that phenomenon, why it's the case. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2830.66s)]
*  It turns out actually there's some kind of rationality to it. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2832.7799999999997s)]
*  Other people have showed that when women do negotiate, when they do initiate negotiations, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2836.46s)]
*  they tend to experience a lot of backlash. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2840.46s)]
*  And I would argue that that would apply to other forms of lower status, whether it's [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2842.9s)]
*  social class or minority status, that there is some sense that if I do ask for more things, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2846.5s)]
*  that I'm going to get some negative feedback, tightness. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2852.06s)]
*  There's a frequently communicated result. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2855.06s)]
*  It may or may not be true, but that women have a harder time asking for raises. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2856.82s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2860.38s)]
*  Well, that's an example of, you know, in negotiation situations, you don't get a memo that says [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2861.38s)]
*  it's time for you to do this. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2865.54s)]
*  They're very ambiguous, weak situations is what we'd call them. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2866.66s)]
*  So you need to sort of perceive the opportunity. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2869.26s)]
*  Then you need to feel comfortable and emotionally comfortable with taking on that opportunity. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2872.38s)]
*  And so asking for raises is something that involves all those processes. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2877.5s)]
*  You have to perceive that it's even possible. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2882.06s)]
*  Most times when you're around people who are who are very powerful, they might tell you [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2884.42s)]
*  to do this. Mentors tell you it's time for you to do this. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2888.46s)]
*  I tend to, I should say, negotiate a lot. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2891.54s)]
*  So I'm not sure. And that's always been the case. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2893.46s)]
*  I've never felt like it's it's a problem to ask for something. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2895.9s)]
*  Ask and you should receive or, you know, you're not going to get something if you don't ask [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2898.82s)]
*  for it. But there are some social consequences to asking for women. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2902.46s)]
*  So it's a delicate balance of how you do that. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2905.7000000000003s)]
*  Are Americans less patient as negotiators? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2908.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And why? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2910.7000000000003s)]
*  Did Tocqueville really notice this as an American trait years ago, that Americans seem to be [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2912.82s)]
*  pretty impatient? You know, we live in a context, I think, an underrated context. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2917.82s)]
*  The concept in psychology is metaphor. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2923.78s)]
*  We live in a context where sports metaphors, game metaphors are really guiding a lot of [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2926.82s)]
*  interaction in general, but also in negotiation. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2930.3s)]
*  And in those contexts, the clock is ticking. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2932.94s)]
*  People feel like they have they have to get things done quickly. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2935.78s)]
*  And that's where the impatience comes from. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2938.98s)]
*  It comes from certain metaphors. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2940.58s)]
*  When you're in a relationship metaphor, the clock is not ticking. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2942.54s)]
*  The relationship metaphor is much more common in places like East Asia or the Middle East, where [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2945.86s)]
*  understanding one's honor and building trust is not something that you could put a time [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2950.06s)]
*  limit on. So Americans tend to operate in certain metaphoric frameworks, and that guides [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2955.02s)]
*  their impatience. And to some extent, that's OK here in the U.S., but it doesn't work so [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2959.98s)]
*  well in other places. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2964.2599999999998s)]
*  Putting aside your political views, but just if you observe Donald Trump as a negotiator, as [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2965.3s)]
*  a psychologist, what strikes you? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2970.5s)]
*  You know, I think Donald Trump has a very classic negotiation style. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2972.34s)]
*  It's a distributive negotiation style. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2975.74s)]
*  It's a win-lose style. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2977.66s)]
*  It's a win-lose style. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2979.06s)]
*  It works in certain contexts, especially contexts where there's one issue or when there's very [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2980.18s)]
*  little expected future interaction. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2984.3s)]
*  But what Donald Trump does is he takes that style to international politics, where these [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2986.38s)]
*  contexts, the structure of these situations is very different. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2991.46s)]
*  There's usually many issues at the table. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2994.38s)]
*  There's expected future action. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2996.1s)]
*  Trump also not only uses this distributive tactics like threats, he makes threats very [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=2998.5s)]
*  easily. And psychologists know that threats create a lot of reactants. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3004.2200000000003s)]
*  When you threaten me, I'm going to threaten you right back. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3007.9s)]
*  When I teach students how to negotiate and I train them, if someone threatens you, you go [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3009.98s)]
*  right back to interest. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3013.34s)]
*  You tell them I can threaten you, but let's go back to interest. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3014.46s)]
*  That's really where we're going to make a lot of action in this negotiation. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3016.82s)]
*  So his style is really mismatched with the context that he's in. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3019.94s)]
*  I'll say one more thing as a cross-cultural psychologist is that Trump, as many negotiators [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3023.98s)]
*  need to do, is to develop cultural intelligence. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3028.2200000000003s)]
*  In our data, cultural intelligence is just as important as general intelligence or emotional [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3030.34s)]
*  intelligence. And that's one thing he really doesn't understand is the cultural context, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3034.18s)]
*  that there are so many ways you can violate someone's honor in a negotiation. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3038.62s)]
*  I've studied this among hundreds of professional negotiators in the Middle East. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3042.18s)]
*  If I'm on my phone and negotiating with you, that's a sign that I'm not respecting you [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3045.46s)]
*  enough to put my phone away. If I wear something that's not formal in a negotiation, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3048.98s)]
*  that's a sign of disrespect. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3052.98s)]
*  That could be as important as the economics of the negotiation. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3054.1s)]
*  So Trump needs to gain some cultural intelligence, in my point of view. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3058.06s)]
*  How can people best learn cultural intelligence? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3061.4199999999996s)]
*  Say they're a prospective diplomat or politician or CEO. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3063.54s)]
*  What's the path to learning culture like you? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3066.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think immersing yourself in different cultures. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3069.02s)]
*  I think it's studying cross-cultural psychology because I think part of the problem is that [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3071.74s)]
*  in anthropology and other disciplines, I think part of the problem is that a lot of people [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3076.5s)]
*  get these dos and don'ts, every superficial aspects of culture when they're being sent on [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3080.3799999999997s)]
*  an expatriate assignment. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3084.7s)]
*  They're usually selected because of their technical competence, not because they're culturally [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3086.3799999999997s)]
*  competent. So you need to really see it as a lifelong, at least I do, quest to [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3089.82s)]
*  understand what are the cultural differences and why do they evolve? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3095.06s)]
*  I'll close with a few questions about the Michelle Gelfand production function, which is [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3098.42s)]
*  the classic thing we do in these chats. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3102.5800000000004s)]
*  What's your secret to how you've been so productive so as to publish so much? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3105.46s)]
*  Other than just hard work, right? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3109.3s)]
*  That's obvious. But what is it you can teach other people about how to be productive? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3110.5800000000004s)]
*  Well, I would say that, you know, I think having a passion, it sounds pretty trite, but [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3115.18s)]
*  having a passion means you'll never work a day in your life. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3122.18s)]
*  I feel like being paid to do what I do is an unbelievable feat because I love what I do. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3124.74s)]
*  Like I wake up and I'm just crazy curious about what I do. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3130.5s)]
*  And I think that when you're really curious and really passionate, that it will just drive [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3134.06s)]
*  the rest. It's you know, work doesn't seem like work. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3138.06s)]
*  I also think it's important. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3141.5s)]
*  I mean, our group, you know, a good idea can come from anywhere. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3142.8999999999996s)]
*  It could come from, you know, a lab manager. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3146.3399999999997s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a postdoc. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3148.54s)]
*  And I think in our group, you know, we really try to practice. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3149.7799999999997s)]
*  No one's different. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3152.74s)]
*  It doesn't matter what your level of education is. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3153.66s)]
*  You know, it's matter a matter of just being engaged. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3155.46s)]
*  And I've had a lot of visitors comment on that practice in our group that anyone I like to [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3158.3399999999997s)]
*  tell people come up with the stupidest idea possible. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3163.54s)]
*  Like I want people to feel psychologically safe, whatever their rank, to come up with ideas. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3165.62s)]
*  Many of them, like I have many ideas that are not good, but some of them might be good. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3171.5s)]
*  There's always a kind of implicit bidding for quality co-authors. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3175.98s)]
*  A lot of people will want to work with them. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3179.38s)]
*  So you're choosing co-authors. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3181.34s)]
*  They're choosing you in turn. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3182.74s)]
*  What is it you think you know about spotting talent in collaborators that maybe other people [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3184.1s)]
*  don't? I think it's commitment. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3188.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, this again sounds pretty obvious, but it's commitment to, you know, and passion for [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3190.94s)]
*  similar questions, but having very different perspectives on them. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3195.6600000000003s)]
*  So and these interdisciplinary collaborations are just when they can work. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3199.6600000000003s)]
*  And many of them don't. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3203.9s)]
*  They're just beautiful because you have people who are interested in the same questions. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3205.38s)]
*  And yet we have such different complementary expertise that it makes for like really [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3209.94s)]
*  interesting research. I could say that with Dana now at Maryland and his students who have [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3214.6600000000003s)]
*  been trained in evolution and game theory, collaborating with cross-cultural psychologists. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3218.9399999999996s)]
*  We eat together breakfast every other week. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3222.7799999999997s)]
*  And maybe that helps. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3225.3399999999997s)]
*  We always are having our meetings at restaurants, but we really are committed to the same [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3226.98s)]
*  problems. We have very different perspectives on them. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3230.4199999999996s)]
*  Some collaborations are harder. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3233.3799999999997s)]
*  I remember I was working as part of a MIRI grant with an Israeli computer scientist, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3235.5s)]
*  Sarit Klaus, really brilliant woman. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3239.7799999999997s)]
*  And she said to me, Michelle, when she came to Maryland, she was developing computer agents to [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3241.54s)]
*  negotiate. And I wanted to use these computer agents and bring her work into our work on [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3245.82s)]
*  negotiation. And she said, Michelle, I'm not interested at all about human behavior. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3250.42s)]
*  And I was crushed at the time. And I said to her, you know what, while we're being honest, I don't [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3254.5800000000004s)]
*  really care about your computer agent. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3258.2200000000003s)]
*  And then we realized, like, OK, we're going to have to start somewhere. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3260.2200000000003s)]
*  How are we going to integrate our interests? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3263.1800000000003s)]
*  And it turns out I said to her, look, your agent is going to be a better agent, which is her [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3264.98s)]
*  quest, if it understands culture. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3268.82s)]
*  And I can use your agent to collect data in a very standardized way in Lebanon and the U.S. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3271.1s)]
*  So I can actually benefit from your work. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3276.06s)]
*  We never had a common problem, per se, but we were able to integrate our interests enough and get [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3277.66s)]
*  past the really do I want to work with you kind of stage. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3282.1s)]
*  So it takes a lot of commitment. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3285.1s)]
*  And those complementary skills can help both parties advance their research agendas. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3286.3799999999997s)]
*  Last question. What is it that other academics don't know about teaching and mentoring? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3290.7799999999997s)]
*  I would say it's like these are like your kids. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3296.98s)]
*  Right. I mean, they're when you accept a student, a PhD student, like they're you're going to be [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3299.98s)]
*  committed to them for not just five years, but forever. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3305.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, I feel like my students, they'll write me emails when they're growing for tenure or [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3308.6200000000003s)]
*  they're going for full whatever. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3313.1400000000003s)]
*  And they're like, I need some mentoring. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3314.1000000000004s)]
*  And I always tell my students, like, once a mentor, you're always a mentor. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3315.78s)]
*  These are going to become your family. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3317.94s)]
*  That's at least my approach. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3319.98s)]
*  And I think I still rely on Harry Triandis. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3321.38s)]
*  I've sent him every chapter of this book. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3323.94s)]
*  He's 90 years old. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ELs54BmuY&t=3325.54s)]
