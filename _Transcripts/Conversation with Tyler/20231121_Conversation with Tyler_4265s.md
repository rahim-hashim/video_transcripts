Video Description: The one concept most valuable for understanding the news today might be Henry Farrell’s theory of weaponized interdependence. Whether it’s China’s influence over the NBA, the US ban of Huawei, or whether social media should be regulated on a global scale, Henry Farrell has played a key role articulating how global economic networks can enable state coercion.

Tyler and Henry discuss these issues and more, including what a big tech breakup would mean for security and privacy, why political economics suggests Facebook’s Oversight Board won’t work, what Italy might reveal about China’s future, his family connection to Joyce, his undying affection for My Bloody Valentine, why Philip K. Dick would have reveled in QAnon, why Twitter seems left-wing, and being a first generation academic blogger.

*  visit conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=19.82s)]
*  Hello, I'm here today with Henry Farrell. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=27.68s)]
*  I first learned of Henry through his blogging at Crooked Timber. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=29.76s)]
*  He has been a co-founder there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=33.04s)]
*  But Henry, in addition to that, is a professor of political science at George Washington. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=35.28s)]
*  He has written two notable books, The Political Economy of Trust, and more recently, with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=40.44s)]
*  Abraham Newman, of Privacy and Power. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=45.24s)]
*  He has popularized and developed the notion of weaponized interdependence and done, in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=48.42s)]
*  fact, much, much more in the popular sphere. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=53.72s)]
*  He is an incoming editor at Monkey Cage Blog, at the Washington Post, and has written just [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=56.48s)]
*  about everywhere else you can imagine. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Henry, welcome. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=63.44s)]
*  I'm delighted to be here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=64.44s)]
*  First question. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  If we think about the Chinese company, Huawei, what can and should the United States government [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  do to counter Huawei from controlling 5G communications networks for its main allies? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=73.6s)]
*  Well, what the US government is currently doing is considering using its control of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  supply networks in order to try to block Huawei, because Huawei relies substantially [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=83.92s)]
*  on chips which are made by companies like Qualcomm. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=90.52s)]
*  And so the United States has used this so-called entity list, which is a means of effectively [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=93.92s)]
*  designating Huawei as a problematic company to put the supply chain relationships which [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=99.04s)]
*  Huawei needs under threat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=105.76s)]
*  Now it's not clear whether the US is going to deliver on this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=107.72s)]
*  This is one of the problems that the current administration has, which is that there's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=110.24s)]
*  an implicit break between on the one hand people like Donald Trump, who think primarily [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  in terms of trade and some very strange ideas about what victory in trade is, and on the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=119.2s)]
*  other hand people who are more concerned with the long-term security relationship, who have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=124.64s)]
*  viewed Huawei as a threat for a number of years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=128.68s)]
*  So what I would suggest is probably going to happen is that we're going to see some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=131.5s)]
*  kind of a compromise where Trump is going to offer and indeed has suggested that he [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=135.0s)]
*  will offer some concessions on Huawei, which is going to make people in the defense establishment [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=139.92s)]
*  very unhappy because they see Huawei as a long-term threat because they fear that the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=145.28s)]
*  5G network that has been constructed around the world could be used by Huawei to give [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  China access to people's communications in more or less the same way as the NSA was able [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  to help the United States listen in on the world for a number of years. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  Sure, but what should we do? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  So if you imagine Huawei controlling Germany's 5G network, that sounds pretty dire, almost [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=165.5s)]
*  like letting the KGB run your phone system. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=169.94s)]
*  So I think we probably need to wake up to the fact that we're going to be in a world [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=172.06s)]
*  where there are going to be security vulnerabilities and there's more or less not very much that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=175.94s)]
*  we can do about it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=179.78s)]
*  So the key questions I think about are here is there's different trade-offs. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=180.78s)]
*  So first of all you can think about the trade-offs of surveillance, which I think is what most [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=185.32s)]
*  people think about with Huawei, and there's a good reason why a number of countries, including [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=188.46s)]
*  US allies, have decided to opt for Huawei because they figure they're already being [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=194.62s)]
*  listened into by the United States. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=198.78s)]
*  They're probably going to be listened into by China anyway, so what matter does it make? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=200.82s)]
*  It probably doesn't make all that much difference and whichever technology you're going to use, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  there's probably going to be some way of penetrating it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=210.94s)]
*  The more complicated, more difficult question is whether or not Huawei or other kinds of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  companies like it could be linked into other forms of systems in ways which might pose [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=220.66s)]
*  an active security threat which goes further than just listening. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=225.7s)]
*  And this is something that Bruce Schneier, for example, has talked about in a wonderful [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=229.22s)]
*  book that came out about nine months ago called To Kill Everyone Click Here, where he more [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=232.22s)]
*  or less talks about the huge security risks which are associated with the so-called internet [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=237.1s)]
*  of things, which turns out to be an internet of really, really badly designed and badly [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=241.28s)]
*  secured things. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=246.98s)]
*  And when one thinks about the ways in which, for example, what kinds of consequences it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=248.26s)]
*  might have if you have a breakdown of communications at the time that there is a military attack, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=252.66s)]
*  that's the kind of thing that I think people really need to think carefully about. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=258.3s)]
*  So I would guess that the best way to think about this is to, on the one hand, accept [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=262.34s)]
*  the fact that there is going to be some level of surveillance that is happening, that given [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  current technologies, there's always going to be some kind of a back door there to be [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=269.96s)]
*  exploited, and on the other hand, try to make critical systems as secure and robust [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=273.46s)]
*  as possible and think as much as possible about things like multiple redundancies, not [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=279.06s)]
*  necessarily economically efficient in terms of market, but nonetheless things which will [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=284.58s)]
*  allow you to secure yourself and have possible backup systems in the case that something [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=289.38s)]
*  major is suddenly compromised. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=295.29999999999995s)]
*  So I think that's where we're moving towards is a world which is much less going to be [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=297.52s)]
*  about trying to pare things down to the minimum in search of economic efficiency and much [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=300.94s)]
*  more about robustness, redundancy, and trying to think carefully through the fact that we [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=306.18s)]
*  live in a fundamentally insecure world. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=311.14s)]
*  People are beginning to take advantage of it, and we need to gear up in order to think [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=313.46s)]
*  better about this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=317.06s)]
*  But if I call you now on my iPhone to your iPhone, China can't listen in, right? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=318.06s)]
*  Well that- [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=322.94s)]
*  But we'd be giving them the whole key to all communications. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=323.94s)]
*  Well that depends. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=326.46s)]
*  We don't know whether China can or cannot listen in. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=328.34s)]
*  We don't know, but we know that if it's Huawei 5G, they can intercept any communications [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=330.34s)]
*  they want by manipulating Huawei, which is not quite a state-owned enterprise, but it's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=334.44s)]
*  state-controlled as are most or maybe all major companies in China. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=338.7s)]
*  It just seems to not fulfill the fiduciary responsibilities of the United States government. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=343.18s)]
*  Well then I think the interesting question is whether or not all of the other governments [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=348.34s)]
*  and the United States government have not been fulfilling their fiduciary responsibilities [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=351.96s)]
*  by allowing systems which have been penetrated. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=356.3s)]
*  We know quite thoroughly by the NSA to the point that the NSA for a period basically [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=359.26s)]
*  recorded all of the phone calls going back and forth within a particular country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=364.38s)]
*  I believe it was Bermuda in order more or less to show that this could be done. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=368.06s)]
*  So- [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=372.18s)]
*  Sure, so Merkel won't make an important call on her iPhone anymore, but I would say [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=373.18s)]
*  that's the correct German response and the correct American response is to be equally [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=376.32s)]
*  or even more skeptical of Huawei, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=381.2s)]
*  Which is not a democracy, it's an autocracy, it's from a country that's put over a million [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=383.32s)]
*  people in camps. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=387.58s)]
*  Why should we even consider letting them be the backbone of the free world's communications [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=389.18s)]
*  network? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=393.94s)]
*  Well, I think that the question is, well there are two questions here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=394.94s)]
*  First there's the US question, the domestic question which I think has been sorted out [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=398.62s)]
*  and the US has decided that Huawei is not going to be allowed to supply goods to its [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=402.02s)]
*  telecommunications providers. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=408.3s)]
*  In fact, Huawei has never played any significant role in US telecommunications providers, more [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=409.94s)]
*  or less telcos. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=414.54s)]
*  I remember being told by a lawyer what they did was they used to effectively take bids [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=416.18s)]
*  from Huawei in order to scare Ericsson and Nokia and other companies into offering them [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=421.94s)]
*  better terms, but with the presumption that they were never going to use Huawei because [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=427.62s)]
*  this would get them into too much trouble and security. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=432.74s)]
*  So the question for the US is straightforward. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=435.74s)]
*  The question for other countries is much less straightforward. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=437.86s)]
*  Do they see China as being a fundamental threat or do they just view this as being [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=441.0s)]
*  another nuisance along with the fact that the NSA is listening into their phone calls? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=446.68s)]
*  And it's interesting to see that some countries, including close allies such as the United [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=451.72s)]
*  Kingdom have been much, much less forthright on the US side than one might expect. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=455.18s)]
*  Roughly speaking, I think one could say that there is a, if one wants to look at the ways [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=460.84s)]
*  in which countries have responded, I think a lot of it has to do with their geopolitical [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=464.64s)]
*  or geostrategic exposure to China so that places like Australia and Japan have been [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=468.8s)]
*  far, far more willing to listen to the US on these kinds of things than places like [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=474.3s)]
*  the United Kingdom, which see that there is a plausible threat from Huawei. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=478.6s)]
*  But I think that at the end of the day, the balance between that and having cheap telecommunications [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=482.58000000000004s)]
*  infrastructure is such that they're willing to allow Huawei to provide at least some parts [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=489.36s)]
*  of the machineries that they are looking to have subcontracted out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=494.32s)]
*  How and when will European nations be able to bypass SWIFT as a payments network? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=499.2s)]
*  That's a very good and very interesting question because SWIFT is, as it stands at the moment, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=503.88s)]
*  is nominally a European organization. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=509.04s)]
*  It is a nonprofit organization, a nonprofit consortium, which is based in Belgium. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=511.44s)]
*  So there are ways in which I think if the European Union were to get serious on this, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  it would probably be less about trying to create an alternative system to SWIFT than [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=521.24s)]
*  trying to bring SWIFT more under its own command. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=525.32s)]
*  So at the moment, SWIFT is nominally European, but in fact has a lot of influence from the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  United States. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=533.4s)]
*  The United States has provided many of its senior decision makers, including people like [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=534.4s)]
*  Lenny Schranke, and it has also provided a large number of board members. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=539.96s)]
*  So the European path forward, I think, if Europe wanted to try and minimize its exposure, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=545.0600000000001s)]
*  would be to start to impose a much clearer and more substantial mandate upon SWIFT to [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=550.44s)]
*  effectively force SWIFT under circumstances where the United States tells it to do one [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=556.48s)]
*  thing and Europe tells it to do another. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=560.7600000000001s)]
*  That SWIFT would effectively have much stronger reasons than it does at the moment to comply [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=563.8000000000001s)]
*  with the European threats. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  Now the problem with that from Europe's point of view is that that involves creating a much, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=570.84s)]
*  institutional paraphernalia at the EU level, which is going to be something that is going [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=576.12s)]
*  to be problematic for a number of the member states who don't like to see the European [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=581.96s)]
*  Commission and European institutions taking up that level of power. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=585.96s)]
*  But at the same time, there is, I think, a much, much clearer case being made. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=590.24s)]
*  And if one looks, for example, at the comments that have been made in the run up to the new [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=594.64s)]
*  commission, it's very, very clear from Joseph Barrow and other people that they are looking [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=599.4s)]
*  to really create the European Union as an economic power in a way that hasn't been [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=603.2s)]
*  true in the past. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=608.6400000000001s)]
*  And to the extent that member states begin to buy into that kind of agenda, they probably [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=610.2s)]
*  are going to have to buy into much, much heavier regulatory clout at the EU level, including [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=614.2800000000001s)]
*  the kinds of things that could be used to bring SWIFT to heel. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  But take, say, New York as a banking center. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=622.76s)]
*  So maybe half of Deutsche Bank's business is in New York. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=625.7800000000001s)]
*  The US often cares about foreign policy issues more than Europe does, and we have a potential [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=629.48s)]
*  first mover advantage if we choose to use it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=634.28s)]
*  So if we say to European companies, banks, whatever, well, if you do business with the [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=637.44s)]
*  US financial system, you must adhere to some long list of restrictions that may be as simple [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  as arraigning and sanctions. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=646.96s)]
*  What does the equilibrium actually look like where they can just say, no, we're going to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  go ahead and trade with Iran? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=652.5600000000001s)]
*  Isn't that really quite distant, given the importance of New York as a banking center? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=654.16s)]
*  Well, the way I would push back against that a bit is to not assume what you're assuming, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=658.04s)]
*  which is to say that under many circumstances, it is going to be true that the United States [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=662.28s)]
*  is going to care about this stuff much more than the European Union is. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=666.52s)]
*  And Iran, I think, is a great case of that. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  The EU trade with Iran, it's not insignificant, but it isn't anything enormous either. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=672.04s)]
*  But there are other things which Europe is much, much more worried about. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=677.7199999999999s)]
*  And in particular, what they're worried about is Russia. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=680.8s)]
*  So I think that the counter example to what you say is, assume, for example, that we have [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=683.16s)]
*  a 2020 election in which Donald Trump is ignominiously defeated. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=688.24s)]
*  What we are going to see then plausibly is a situation where a presidency and a Congress, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=693.56s)]
*  even if the Republicans still have the majority in the Senate, they are going to be loaded [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=698.9399999999999s)]
*  for bear. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=702.68s)]
*  They are going to go after Russia with sanctions of one sort or another. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=703.68s)]
*  Many of those sanctions are plausibly going to implicate the European Union. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=706.9s)]
*  And so when one looks at the policy debate in the EU at the moment, I think a lot of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=710.68s)]
*  that policy debate is gearing up for perceived likely fights with the United States over [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=715.28s)]
*  the relationship between Europe and the Russian economy, because of course, Europe depends [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=721.5999999999999s)]
*  much more heavily on Russia for energy and has a wide variety of other economic relations [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=726.3599999999999s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  And so I think that's the situation in which Europe would care much more substantially [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=734.04s)]
*  than the United States or would care as substantially as the United States and would be prepared [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=738.04s)]
*  to push back hard. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=742.24s)]
*  So those are the circumstances under which there has been a recent paper by the European [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=743.8s)]
*  Council on Foreign Relations, which has talked about ways in which Europe could deter United [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=748.16s)]
*  States actions. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  And one of the actions that is proposed there is that the European Union think about licensing [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  requirements for US firms that want to operate in Europe, such that if they cooperate with [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=760.9s)]
*  sanctions against European entities that Europe doesn't like, that these licenses to operate [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=766.16s)]
*  would be withdrawn. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=772.44s)]
*  So that's the kind of circumstance under which I could see actual, at the very least, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=773.8s)]
*  posturing happening at a very, very substantial scale between Europe and the United States [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=778.88s)]
*  and perhaps actual low level economic warfare if the US steps in to try to push back against [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=783.32s)]
*  Europe what Europe regards as being its core interests. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=789.68s)]
*  Now we're chatting in early October and there were two huge stories today, both about weaponized [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=793.2800000000001s)]
*  interdependence. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=797.88s)]
*  So the first is that the European Union seems to be insisting that Facebook take down material [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=799.36s)]
*  posted on Internets outside the European Union. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=804.72s)]
*  What's your view? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=808.12s)]
*  Is that a good decision or a bad decision? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=809.12s)]
*  Well, I try, you know, when I'm looking at this stuff, I try to wear my hat. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=810.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, let me, okay. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=816.1600000000001s)]
*  But I'm interviewing Henry Fowle, the person, right? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=817.7800000000001s)]
*  Okay, so let me back up and let me say two things. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=820.24s)]
*  First of all, if I'm to think about this as a political scientist under my political science [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=822.84s)]
*  hat, what I would say is that this is something which is inevitable and this is something [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=826.4s)]
*  which we're going to see more and more of, which is that the Internet for a long period, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=830.64s)]
*  there was a kind of an equilibrium in which United States managed to persuade everybody [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=834.72s)]
*  that self-regulation and platforms looking after their own business was more or less [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=838.84s)]
*  okay for most purposes. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=843.16s)]
*  That equilibrium has broken down. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=844.92s)]
*  It has broken down in the US. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=846.48s)]
*  It has broken down in Europe. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=848.02s)]
*  But it has broken down in authoritarian societies in particular. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=849.52s)]
*  So I think we're going to see more and more efforts to try and use the platform companies [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=852.84s)]
*  effectively as means of extending, means of extending reach into other jurisdictions and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=858.0s)]
*  imposing universal type restrictions on what they can or cannot do. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=864.34s)]
*  If I want to think about this as a individual, what I would say is that the I'm not at all [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  happy with what the European Union is doing in specific here, but I do think that there [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=875.96s)]
*  needs to be much greater regulation of platform companies. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  And in the absence of United States, I think that the European Union is the most plausible [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=885.1s)]
*  actor, which has got the regulatory clout and the willingness to do so in a manner which [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=889.62s)]
*  is at least somewhat compatible with broad liberal norms. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=894.46s)]
*  So my basic attitude would be to push back against a specific decision, but to say that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=899.0200000000001s)]
*  if the choices between the United States not regulating or perhaps regulating, perhaps [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=904.02s)]
*  that will be different under a possible Warren administration and authoritarian states, that [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=908.5799999999999s)]
*  I would much prefer to have a robust European Union than any of the other actors that I [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=914.14s)]
*  can think of that have the clout and the ability to try and bring the platform companies to [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=918.4599999999999s)]
*  heel. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=923.74s)]
*  The second big story from today is from the world of basketball. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=924.74s)]
*  So as you probably know, Houston Rockets general manager Darrell Morey tweets in favor of the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=927.6s)]
*  Hong Kong protests. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=932.18s)]
*  It seems both the Rockets and the NBA force him to delete the tweet and basically retract [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=933.62s)]
*  his statement. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=938.86s)]
*  Who's in the wrong here? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=940.14s)]
*  Darrell Morey, the Rockets, the NBA, China, everyone? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=941.14s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=944.38s)]
*  OK, well, again, looking at this from my political science hat, this kind of stuff has been happening [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=945.38s)]
*  for a long, long time, but not so much to the United States. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=949.02s)]
*  So there's a book by Blackwell and Harris, which came out with the Council on Foreign [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=952.3s)]
*  Relations a couple of years ago, which looks at how China has been imposing this kind of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=956.62s)]
*  pressure against a variety of smaller countries, especially with respect to the Dalai Lama. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=960.38s)]
*  And when China says jump, companies do tend to jump. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=966.1s)]
*  And of course, we've seen Hollywood for the last number of years has been quite sensitive [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=969.3s)]
*  to the Chinese market, most recently as exemplified by the decision to remove the I think it was [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=974.32s)]
*  the Taiwanese flag from the remake of Top Gun from the back of Tom Cruise's jacket, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=980.54s)]
*  because this was perceived as being possibly provocative. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=986.36s)]
*  So I think that this is pretty standard stuff and that this tells us something about the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=989.18s)]
*  way that businesses operate. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=994.9799999999999s)]
*  And here you can see the way that businesses operate globally as having both great benefits [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=997.02s)]
*  and great weaknesses. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1003.06s)]
*  If one wants to think about the standard story about how interdependence, at least under [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1004.16s)]
*  some circumstances, creates peace because businesses have a incentive to try and create [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1009.8599999999999s)]
*  peaceful and happy relations between nations in order to secure their commerce. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1014.94s)]
*  I think that there's something to it. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1019.5s)]
*  Although as my work with Abe on weaponized interdependence suggests, there also are some [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1021.1800000000001s)]
*  clear limits to that as well. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1025.42s)]
*  But the obverse of this is that business is obviously in the business of making profits. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1027.3s)]
*  And when there are clear political risks associated to business doing certain kinds of things, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1031.66s)]
*  by and large, businesses are not going to be especially courageous. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1036.78s)]
*  I think that this is particularly likely to be true of big firms, which I think are more [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1039.5s)]
*  likely to come under this kind of pressure. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1045.66s)]
*  And one saw this already with regard to Hong Kong. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1048.66s)]
*  There have been that Airways chief executive who effectively got ousted. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1052.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to remember the company, but I can't. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1057.1s)]
*  So I think that this is, in a sense, if you want to outsource a lot of our decision making [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1060.34s)]
*  about culture, about the ways that things ought to be done to business, this is what [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1066.1s)]
*  you're going to expect for better or for worse. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1070.62s)]
*  In a world of increasing weaponized interdependence, exactly to where does the power shift? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1073.18s)]
*  Is it to the big nations, to the nasty nations, to the nations willing to move first, nations [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1078.5s)]
*  or unions? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1083.3s)]
*  What's your general take on who is gaining in status and influence? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1084.46s)]
*  Oh, very, very good question. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1088.1s)]
*  Okay, so I would say that what we're seeing at the moment is a transition from a world [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1090.1399999999999s)]
*  of one big nation, which is the United States, which has had to a very great degree and near [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1094.62s)]
*  monopoly on this stuff, to a series of, you know, to a group of nations, including the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1099.7399999999998s)]
*  United States, but also including China, European Union, India, perhaps, although people don't [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1105.1s)]
*  pay much attention to it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1111.7399999999998s)]
*  I would be interested to know much, much more about what India is doing in this in this [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1112.8999999999999s)]
*  space. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1116.6999999999998s)]
*  And also Russia, with Russia playing less as a significant power that is able to exert [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1117.6999999999998s)]
*  much influence than as a spoiler, trying to figure out ways to screw things up for [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1122.98s)]
*  everybody else. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1127.38s)]
*  So I think that we are moving from a world of unipolarity, to use the standard term that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1128.5s)]
*  international relations scholars use, to a world of multipolarity. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1134.3s)]
*  And one of the things that we can expect from that is that multipolarity tends to lead to [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1138.14s)]
*  a lot of danger of things screwing up and things going wrong. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1142.18s)]
*  And when one looks at how the US has done this over the last number of years, it has [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1146.3s)]
*  managed to prosecute its interests reasonably well while not pushing other countries too [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1150.62s)]
*  far until the Trump administration. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1155.3799999999999s)]
*  That's not true anymore. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1158.42s)]
*  And I think that as other countries come in, many of which are less sophisticated about [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1160.02s)]
*  thinking about what kinds of things they can or cannot do without messing up things for [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1164.78s)]
*  their other for the for other countries or for their own companies, we're going to see [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1169.22s)]
*  far, far more mistakes being made. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1173.3s)]
*  And this is especially true because nobody really understands what the networks are, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1176.66s)]
*  that they're trying to weaponize. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1180.7s)]
*  So that there was one very interesting example of this, which happened with the United States, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1181.9s)]
*  in fact, when it went after Oleg Deripaska, who is one of the Russian oligarchs. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1185.7s)]
*  And Deripaska had a big interest. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1191.18s)]
*  He effectively had control of the Russian aluminum industry. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1193.5800000000002s)]
*  And so the US Treasury Department, OFAC, sanctioned Deripaska, but didn't realize that when it [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1196.8600000000001s)]
*  was sanctioning Deripaska's companies, it was going to mess up the entire West European [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1203.26s)]
*  car manufacturing industry, which relies upon specific aluminum products that only Deripaska's [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1207.94s)]
*  companies can create. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1213.82s)]
*  So this led to this very, very complicated ballet dance in which the Treasury sought [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1215.26s)]
*  to both extend the sanctions and to specify them in ways that would allow for the unwinding, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1221.02s)]
*  at least the nominal unwinding of Deripaska's formal control of the company so as to create [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1227.06s)]
*  an exit strategy. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1232.26s)]
*  But one can see that as we're going to have more and more countries trying to do this [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1234.3799999999999s)]
*  stuff and as they are doing so in a competitive way rather than one country trying as a unipolar [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1237.98s)]
*  power to impose it on everyone else, that the possibilities of mistakes being made and [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1243.98s)]
*  mistakes leading to escalation and minor trade wars blowing up into substantial spats and [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1248.82s)]
*  even outright economic warfare, I think that that possibility is going to get much, much [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1254.86s)]
*  worse. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1258.9s)]
*  Arguably dominant firms are easier to regulate. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1259.9s)]
*  And since you seem to favor some kinds of additional regulation on the major tech companies, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1263.0600000000002s)]
*  does this mean we're too worried about monopoly that we actually want to keep around a few [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1268.42s)]
*  dominant firms and that if we split them up into many small parts, there would be more [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1272.6200000000001s)]
*  chaos or more fake news or more privacy violations? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1276.74s)]
*  If some parts of what they do are bad and you get more competition in the bad, don't [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1280.5s)]
*  we just want to put in GDPR barriers to entry, not quite public utilities, but keep them [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1284.3400000000001s)]
*  big and fat and happy and somewhat not so dynamic? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1289.24s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1291.56s)]
*  Well, it depends on what you value. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1292.56s)]
*  So I think what you value. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1294.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1295.24s)]
*  Well, let me let me put the trade office to you this way. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1296.24s)]
*  I think if you value security, if they highlight that is on security, then the answer is you [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1297.8s)]
*  probably want to keep big companies around because you're going to need you're going [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1303.56s)]
*  to want to impose broad standards. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1308.8s)]
*  You're going to want to create collective security goods. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  And the only actors that can really do that in a substantial way are big businesses of [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1314.24s)]
*  one sort or another. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1318.88s)]
*  If alternatively you value things like privacy and other kinds of rights, then I think you [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1320.24s)]
*  probably want to move towards a equilibrium in which there are far, far fewer big firms. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1324.24s)]
*  So that's where I see the fight being played out. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  I see the fight being played out between people who value security and people who value privacy. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1330.92s)]
*  I think they pull they point in somewhat different directions. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1335.5200000000002s)]
*  And where are you on that spectrum? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1338.2800000000002s)]
*  So I am well, it depends on the time of the day. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1340.0s)]
*  And I find myself 222. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1343.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1346.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, I am. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1347.0400000000002s)]
*  222 p.m. or whether the months of the Narnia. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1348.8s)]
*  I guess I guess that this is something that I've actually been struggling with and thinking [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1351.72s)]
*  about because there's another interesting aspect to this as well, which is if one thinks, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1356.32s)]
*  for example, about a possible Warren administration, which I think is quite plausible at the moment [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1360.08s)]
*  as the as the most plausible candidate, perhaps at the moment on the Democratic side, although [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1365.6399999999999s)]
*  who the hell knows, then I think that what we're going to see is we're going to see [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1370.3999999999999s)]
*  the Warren administration trying to pursue a much more energetic foreign policy agenda, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1373.8799999999999s)]
*  especially on economic policy than we have seen for a number of years. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1381.84s)]
*  And I think that this is especially going to be true in places like tax evasion. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1385.28s)]
*  The Warren administration is going to begin to leverage some of these powers that that [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1389.6s)]
*  have been used for other purposes, primarily for security purposes. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1394.56s)]
*  It is going to leverage these against Swiss banks, against other countries, which are [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1398.6s)]
*  not willing to jump up to the need to try and push back against international financial [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1402.56s)]
*  flows and so on. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1408.96s)]
*  And from my perspective, I think that will be awesome. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1409.96s)]
*  That said, I also think that the problem and this is getting away from the question of [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  corporate power to the question of unipolarity, which is perhaps the question I've been [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1416.6799999999998s)]
*  more interested in and I've been more trying to think about the the other side of that, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1420.84s)]
*  of course, is that unipolarity and the US willingness to use its power in order to crush [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1426.0s)]
*  all opposition have been used in a variety of problematic ways over the last few years. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1432.0s)]
*  So sometimes sometimes I see myself I'm interested in trying to provide advice to [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1436.9199999999998s)]
*  businesses about how to push back against this. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  So Abe and I have a piece that will be that is under editing at the moment for the Harvard [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1444.52s)]
*  Business Review, where we are providing a sense for businesses as to what the landscape [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1449.6s)]
*  is that they're going to face. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1454.9599999999998s)]
*  Sometimes I think that will be very good to see a big, powerful government beginning to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1456.2s)]
*  pursue the wholesale reform of the international financial system, which I think has become [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1461.96s)]
*  problematic for democracy in a variety of ways. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  And quite frankly, which side of that debate I'm going to end up on over the longer term [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1469.52s)]
*  is going to depend on who the particular actors are on the particular on the two sides and [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1474.72s)]
*  which seems to me to be most compatible with a broad, small liberal understanding of, you [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1479.3600000000001s)]
*  know, of the good life and the good society. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1485.32s)]
*  Facebook's proposed Supreme Court. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1487.56s)]
*  How is that going to work out? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1489.8s)]
*  Are you optimistic, pessimistic? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1491.04s)]
*  Will it happen? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1492.8s)]
*  I'm very pessimistic. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1493.72s)]
*  Why? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1494.72s)]
*  So this is a piece that Margaret Levy, who's written on the theory of the state and and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1495.1599999999999s)]
*  Tim O'Reilly and I wrote about 18 months ago where we more or less what we did was we took [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1501.52s)]
*  a standard set of arguments from from political economy and in particular, Norse and wine [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1506.4399999999998s)]
*  gas. So Norse and wine gas, I'm sure you're familiar with and many of your listeners will be [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1512.0s)]
*  familiar with. They have this great article on tying the king's hands where they argued that [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1516.32s)]
*  the glorious revolution, this crucial moment in British history, why it was so incredibly [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1520.72s)]
*  important was that it effectively allowed the monarch to make promises so that previously [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1525.68s)]
*  monarchs have been able to borrow money and then renege on their deaths. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1531.36s)]
*  Once parliament is instituted, the monarch can't do that nearly so easily anymore. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1534.2s)]
*  And this weakness turns out to be an incredible source of power for the British crown over the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1538.8400000000001s)]
*  next couple of centuries. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1543.4s)]
*  It effectively allows it to borrow money and to borrow money freely because the lenders [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1544.64s)]
*  don't have to worry that the money is going to be confiscated. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1549.72s)]
*  And this turns out, as people like John Brewer have discussed in their discussion of the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1552.24s)]
*  British fiscal state of the 18th and 19th century, this turns out to be an enormous [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1556.76s)]
*  source of power projection. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1560.88s)]
*  Now, the problem is, I think that if you look at Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook at the moment, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1562.28s)]
*  he does not have the power to tie his hands. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1566.68s)]
*  Yes, you have this very, very strange corporate structure where Zuckerberg is effectively [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1570.2s)]
*  he is CEO. He is in control of the board. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1575.04s)]
*  He has the majority of the shares that count. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1577.6s)]
*  And so this means I think that it's very, very difficult for Zuckerberg or anyone within [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1579.8s)]
*  Facebook to really credibly commit to tie their own hands in this kind of way. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1584.68s)]
*  Doesn't he have the incentive to tie his own hands? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1589.8799999999999s)]
*  Because the moment he deviates from the court, people blame him for the decisions and what [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1593.0s)]
*  he possibly would like is simply for it to be someone else's responsibility. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1598.04s)]
*  So it's then incentive compatible now. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1602.16s)]
*  Well, we've seen we've seen multiple instances in the past where Facebook has proposed all [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1604.2s)]
*  of these these arrangements by which there would be referendums of their users and so [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1608.56s)]
*  on. And where it effectively began to renaise on this once it became clear that this was [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1613.88s)]
*  inconvenient for Facebook's underlying business model. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1617.92s)]
*  So the question is, I guess the question is, I think that this is going to work up to the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1620.48s)]
*  point where there are serious implications for Facebook's business model. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1625.6000000000001s)]
*  And past that point, Zuckerberg is going to have a very, very strong incentive to renaise. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think that there's a more general problem if we think about platform economies that [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1633.92s)]
*  platform companies, I think, have become too powerful to commit to, you know, to behave [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1639.0s)]
*  in good ways. So if you look, for example, at Amazon, if you look at Google, all of these [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1644.44s)]
*  are not they're not only businesses, but they're also effectively micro economies in their [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1648.68s)]
*  own right. They are both market players and they are the marketplace itself for key [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1653.1200000000001s)]
*  aspects of the information economy. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1658.0s)]
*  And I think that makes it really, really difficult for them to guarantee credibly to [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1659.96s)]
*  other market actors that they are not going to take advantage of the unique power, the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1665.0800000000002s)]
*  unique access to information, access to ability to shape market conditions that they have. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1669.88s)]
*  And even if they want to, it's going to be extremely difficult, I would imagine, for [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1675.1200000000001s)]
*  something like Jeff Bezos, when he's got all of these hungry young executives who are [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1679.3600000000001s)]
*  trying to make money and whose future depends on their ability to make money, to stop [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1684.3600000000001s)]
*  them from pushing the envelope in ways that may undermine Amazon or Google's or [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1689.2800000000002s)]
*  indeed Facebook's market position over the longer run. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1695.2800000000002s)]
*  So I think that this is a much, much more general problem. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1697.68s)]
*  And we know far less about the internal hierarchies of these companies and the internal [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1700.72s)]
*  political economies of these companies than we ought to. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1705.32s)]
*  But what we do know, and here I think Tim O'Reilly's recent book is quite good in this, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1707.6399999999999s)]
*  gives us some reason to suspect that they may have some real problems. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1711.52s)]
*  What should we do then with speech on Facebook? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1715.6799999999998s)]
*  If the Supreme Court idea is so flawed, what's the better idea, especially for a country [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1718.24s)]
*  that has a First Amendment? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1722.52s)]
*  That's a that's a problem that I've known. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1723.56s)]
*  I've maybe it's the best idea that there is. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1725.9199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1728.24s)]
*  OK, OK. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1728.68s)]
*  Well, but I guess the problem with Facebook is, you know, you look at the business model, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1729.48s)]
*  there's just no way, given Facebook's business model, that it can credibly act. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1733.28s)]
*  Even if you get away from the questions of political responsibility and who ought Facebook [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  be responsible to, there's no very good way for it to successfully police a speech on [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1743.32s)]
*  its platform, given the tools that it has. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1750.48s)]
*  Machine learning can do wonderful things, but machine learning, I think, simply is not [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1753.04s)]
*  going to ever be able to keep up with the multifarious ways in which human beings can [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1757.2s)]
*  use language in order to communicate nasty and unpleasant things to each other. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1762.64s)]
*  So I guess the completely unsatisfactory answer I have to your question is, I just [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1766.64s)]
*  don't think that one can come up with a satisfactory solution either in political [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1772.16s)]
*  terms or in terms of effectiveness, given the economy that we have at the moment to [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1777.0800000000002s)]
*  the problem of policing free speech. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1782.8s)]
*  First of all, there is no universal standards. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1784.8400000000001s)]
*  Secondly, even if there were universal standards, I don't think that we have the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1787.04s)]
*  appropriate technical tools to be able to implement them when we've got companies that [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1790.68s)]
*  have billions of users and thousands or tens of thousands of employees. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1794.96s)]
*  But we can't regulate H&N very well either, right? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1798.4s)]
*  They post the very nastiest stuff you can imagine. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1800.96s)]
*  They're presumably a small company. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1803.92s)]
*  They don't have any kind of dominant position. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1806.4s)]
*  I've never even wanted to visit, but I've read about what's on there and we can't stop [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1809.52s)]
*  them either. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1814.1200000000001s)]
*  So it doesn't seem the problem is Facebook or the structure of the economy. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1814.68s)]
*  Doesn't isn't it just the case we now have technologies where everything that can be [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1818.76s)]
*  said will be said? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1822.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, we're not going to stop that. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1823.64s)]
*  Well, I guess the question for me is the and again, this is a wide open question [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1824.92s)]
*  because we simply don't have enough good empirical research. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1830.0800000000002s)]
*  But what is the relationship in the broader ecology between companies like H&N and [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1833.0s)]
*  companies like Facebook? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1838.3600000000001s)]
*  So I suspect that companies like H&N will be far, far less successful if there weren't [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1839.3200000000002s)]
*  bigger, much bigger platforms like Facebook that they could effectively grow upon. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1844.64s)]
*  So here the argument is something as follows. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1850.4s)]
*  If you think about H&N and if you think about 4chan before it, they were basically meme [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1852.2800000000002s)]
*  factories. They were basically these places where these bored individuals hung out. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1856.48s)]
*  You also created these memes in a kind of process of frenzied Darwinian evolution, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1860.64s)]
*  where you desperately want to make sure that your whatever you had said was on the front [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1864.96s)]
*  page because otherwise it would disappear forever. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1869.24s)]
*  And so you've got this survival of the fittest thing where incredibly valuable are an [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1871.52s)]
*  incredibly effective memes go out and begin to populate the entire space. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1875.4399999999998s)]
*  But you need two things for that to work. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1879.8s)]
*  First of all, you need a process of generation. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1881.7199999999998s)]
*  And secondly, you need some kind of process of dissemination. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1884.1599999999999s)]
*  You need other platforms which have far greater reach, which can then allow for these [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1887.4799999999998s)]
*  memes to propagate through the atmosphere. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1892.6399999999999s)]
*  And so I suspect that if we were in a world in which everything was at the scale of a [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1896.0s)]
*  Chan rather than having a mixture of companies at the scale of a Chan and companies [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1900.32s)]
*  at the scale of Facebook, that the likelihood of this stuff spreading and becoming [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1905.36s)]
*  epidemic across the entire community of Internet users would be far, far less. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1910.32s)]
*  Obviously, we would have other problems then. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1915.1599999999999s)]
*  But I think that the problems that we would face would be a very, very different set of [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1917.32s)]
*  problems from the problems that we face in the current in the current environment. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1920.28s)]
*  Right now, WhatsApp is end to end encrypted and it's either very hard or impossible to [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1924.2s)]
*  crack that. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1928.36s)]
*  Should the law insist on a back door in the United States? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1929.24s)]
*  In the United States? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1932.72s)]
*  OK. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1933.76s)]
*  Not Denmark. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1934.0s)]
*  So I'm OK. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1935.64s)]
*  I'm I'm actually I've got a lot of friends who aren't the other side of this. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1937.8000000000002s)]
*  I think that it is OK to have this as long as there is clear legal process around it. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1941.92s)]
*  And I think that is a question. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1947.3200000000002s)]
*  So there are kangaroo courts for NSA surveillance. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1948.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1951.16s)]
*  Snowden has pointed out basically that they'll approve whatever request comes in. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1951.68s)]
*  That has changed to some degree. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1956.3200000000002s)]
*  So if you look at FISA now, FISA is a very, very different beast than it was in the past. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1957.68s)]
*  And more or less, the problem with FISA, as I understand it, was that effective as a [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1962.8s)]
*  court in which only one side was able to present its evidence. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1965.92s)]
*  And now you have effective public advocates. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1969.96s)]
*  You have a number of people who act as advocates of the general public interest and who [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1972.04s)]
*  are read into the secrecy surrounding it, but are not representative of the interests of [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1976.28s)]
*  the security community. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1980.2s)]
*  And so my understanding is that FISA is still perhaps problematic from a civil liberties [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1981.68s)]
*  perspective, but it is far, far less problematic than it used to be. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1985.92s)]
*  So I think that it is possible to do this kind of stuff. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1990.0800000000002s)]
*  It takes careful institutional design. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1993.04s)]
*  And in general, I think that it is OK to have some legal access to heavily encrypted, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=1995.52s)]
*  heavily encrypted information. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2004.72s)]
*  The problems, of course, are going to be, A, you know, as you say, that this is likely to be [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2006.8400000000001s)]
*  something which is going to be swept up in the security state. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2011.68s)]
*  And B, that's really implement this properly. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2014.04s)]
*  We're going to have to see the creation of some kind of a system, probably among [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2016.48s)]
*  advanced industrial democracies in Western Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2022.04s)]
*  and a number, a small number of other countries where there is some set of shared standards [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2028.0s)]
*  and shared agreements around this. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2033.32s)]
*  So we're beginning to see the battles starting over that with agreements between the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2034.52s)]
*  United States and between the United States and the United Kingdom over access to electronic [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2039.04s)]
*  evidence. I worry that this discussion is going to be dominated by the security side of [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2043.72s)]
*  the house. But to the extent that privacy, privacy advocates, privacy officials are able to [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2051.0s)]
*  get into this debate as well, I think that one could plausibly come up with something which [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2057.04s)]
*  is which is going to be reasonably respectful of civil liberties. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2062.12s)]
*  Why does Twitter seem to be relatively left wing politically? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2066.76s)]
*  I don't mean the company. I mean, the service. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2070.88s)]
*  So first thing, I'm taking the statement on faith because I actually haven't seen any [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2073.68s)]
*  research on this. There must be somebody whose research on sort of broad left wing versus [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2077.56s)]
*  right wing views on Twitter using NLP or something similar. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2081.7999999999997s)]
*  I haven't seen that research to the extent that it is true. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2085.6s)]
*  I think that if one wanted to come up with a kind of a half baked social science theory, which [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2090.9599999999996s)]
*  might or might not be correct. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2098.36s)]
*  It might be because the valences of the service are much more about quasi solidaristic [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2099.96s)]
*  about creating affirmations of shared values of shared communities in ways that plausibly [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2107.4s)]
*  work. But then I then argue against myself. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2114.1200000000003s)]
*  So I would immediately think, well, the same thing ought to be true of a variety of [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2118.1600000000003s)]
*  conservative communities. So when I look at my Twitter, my Twitter is certainly much more [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2121.52s)]
*  left wing. But that is also mine. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2126.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's that. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2128.8s)]
*  That's a function. And maybe, you know, I wonder again if there's research on this and [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2130.28s)]
*  if there and if there's not research, I wonder to what extent this perception is a [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2135.6400000000003s)]
*  function of the truncation. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2141.2000000000003s)]
*  If it's just perception rather than reality, to what extent is the perception the results of [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2143.04s)]
*  the truncation of a big chunk of the right out of the conversation? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2147.04s)]
*  Because if you think about the conversation that we're involved in, it's a conversation which [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2150.7200000000003s)]
*  you might call small L liberal. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2154.96s)]
*  That is people who are on either side of the aisle, but who are plausibly committed to a [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2157.08s)]
*  kind of a kind of popper or Gellner way of thinking about the world in which you want [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2162.68s)]
*  to have in which you want to have debate on both sides of the aisle, because this is how [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2169.04s)]
*  you advance, advance argument, advance your understanding of society. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2172.88s)]
*  But on the right side of that, there has been a truncation where a lot of people, I think, have [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2177.76s)]
*  peeled off and where Donald Trump has had, I think, some very, very substantial consequences [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2181.76s)]
*  for debate. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2187.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't follow many people who are avid followers of Donald Trump, and I follow them more or [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2188.6800000000003s)]
*  less in a more or less a sort of a clinical way rather than a these are people who are going [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2194.2400000000002s)]
*  to have interesting and unexpected things to say to me kind of way. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2200.6400000000003s)]
*  So I wonder whether or not that perception is much more a result of the fact that if you [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2203.6800000000003s)]
*  are a certain kind of libertarian, the people you want to talk to are going to be far more on [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2208.24s)]
*  the left side of the aisle right now than they would have been five or six years ago. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2212.4799999999996s)]
*  The Martin Gury thesis is that with the Internet, we see everything better and more clearly and [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2216.3999999999996s)]
*  there's more transparency and we become jaded and cynical because the elites are not so [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2221.2s)]
*  wonderful and everyone seems more dogmatic on Twitter perhaps than they are in real life. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2225.4799999999996s)]
*  And thus we grow disillusioned with politics. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2230.56s)]
*  Agree or disagree? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2233.08s)]
*  Well, I think that a lot of it also has to do with the former Twitter that it was 140 [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2234.2s)]
*  characters and then 280 characters. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2239.08s)]
*  There has been some research which suggests that the increase in the character limit has [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2241.12s)]
*  actually had consequences for the for perceptions of real argument happening as opposed to [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2245.68s)]
*  people just setting out stances. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2251.36s)]
*  So I think that there is certainly something to be said for the for the increased, you [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2253.92s)]
*  know, the increased dogmatism. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2260.24s)]
*  That is when you see the other side and what the other side actually says, that there can [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2261.7999999999997s)]
*  be a tendency towards polarization. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2265.64s)]
*  But I also see a lot of very interesting conversations happening on Twitter that I [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2268.3199999999997s)]
*  would know that I would never been exposed to before. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2274.2s)]
*  And over time, maybe I've mellowed. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2277.4399999999996s)]
*  I've become much nicer. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2278.72s)]
*  I've become much more deliberate in not getting involved in confrontations or fights on [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2279.72s)]
*  Twitter myself because I just don't have time in my life. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2285.0s)]
*  And as a result, I found it a much, much more pleasant experience to get to know people [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2288.24s)]
*  and not feel that when they say something that you think is idiotic or reprehensible, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2294.2s)]
*  that you necessarily have to argue with them because maybe tomorrow or the next day they'll [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2299.2s)]
*  say something that's more interesting. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2303.32s)]
*  And that brings you back into a feeling of communion with them. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2304.56s)]
*  Shall we try some overrated versus underrated? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2307.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2310.28s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2310.72s)]
*  Bitcoin? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2311.04s)]
*  I think overrated. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2313.24s)]
*  Why? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2314.08s)]
*  So I think that Bitcoin, if you think about Bitcoin, it purports to be a technological [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2314.84s)]
*  hack. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2322.36s)]
*  It's really, I think, an effort at a sociological hack. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2322.92s)]
*  And I don't think it's particularly worked. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2326.6s)]
*  I think that we're going to see the underlying technologies being adopted to the extent that [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2328.0s)]
*  they are useful for better financial services. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2333.28s)]
*  But I think that the ideology of Bitcoin, the idea that you could effectively, like [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2338.4799999999996s)]
*  some kind of like the villain in Rapunzel, that you could create this machine for sowing [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2345.12s)]
*  value out of rubbish, you know, so basically that's what Bitcoin is. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2350.9199999999996s)]
*  It's turning wasted computer cycles into something that people view as being a thing of [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2355.8399999999997s)]
*  value. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2359.72s)]
*  I think that it succeeded among a significant enough community that it's going to survive [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2360.3999999999996s)]
*  and be around for a while. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2366.4399999999996s)]
*  I don't think it's ever going to take off beyond that community. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2367.76s)]
*  The Slovenian theorist Zizek. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2369.92s)]
*  I don't have any very strong opinions. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2372.12s)]
*  I have never actually read Zizek. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2373.56s)]
*  I think that means you think he's overrated. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2374.88s)]
*  Analytic Marxism. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2377.2s)]
*  Analytic Marxism, I think, is well, I think is underrated. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2378.68s)]
*  I think it's going to come back. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2381.72s)]
*  Now, when I say Analytic Marxism, let me be specific about that. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2383.2s)]
*  I think that there's a lot of marks, which I think is flat out wrong. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2387.04s)]
*  And the Analytic Marxist project itself, I think, drove itself into a hole. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2391.4s)]
*  If you look at people like Elster, the other people who were strongly committed to it, I [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2396.52s)]
*  think that they that they eventually ended up figuring out that there wasn't if you wanted to [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2401.36s)]
*  make sense of Marx, you're going to come to the conclusion that eventually there wasn't much [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2406.96s)]
*  point. There wasn't much sense to be made of it. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2410.92s)]
*  But nonetheless, I think the basic underlying the underlying idea, which is that if you bring [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2413.0s)]
*  together rationalist perspectives with a direct concern with power relations and a desire to [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2419.2s)]
*  understand power relations in the Marxist and the Weberian way, that this is something which is [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2425.52s)]
*  coming to the fore again. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2430.28s)]
*  I think which is something which is extremely valuable. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2431.56s)]
*  So somebody else who I think is underrated in this in this context is Manco Olson. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2433.92s)]
*  And so, for example, I think if you want to understand where Elizabeth Warren is going, I [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2438.56s)]
*  think you want to go back to Manco Olson's book on the rise and decline of nations, because I [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2444.08s)]
*  think what Elizabeth Warren is pursuing is very much an Olsonian view of how markets work, that [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2448.2s)]
*  drag and dross and corruption builds up and that in order to allow markets to achieve their full [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  potential, you need to you know, you basically need to cleanse them at a certain point. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2460.44s)]
*  So I see Warren as being somebody who has very much taken on the law and economics training. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2466.6s)]
*  And you see, I think, big marks of that in her thinking, but who has turned it in a very [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2472.96s)]
*  different ideological direction. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2476.72s)]
*  The economic future of Bologna, Italy. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2478.24s)]
*  I've not been there in about 20 odd years. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2481.6s)]
*  So I my sense is that the it's it's that the kinds of manufacturing community that I studied [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  back then is still surviving, but I don't think it's thriving in nearly the same way. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2493.3199999999997s)]
*  But I really don't know enough to say I've not been there. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2498.3599999999997s)]
*  Does Italy have any way out of its current box, high levels of debt, zero per capita income [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2500.8799999999997s)]
*  growth for now, what, 18 years? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2505.3199999999997s)]
*  Doesn't it all have to end badly or is there a magic escape? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2507.68s)]
*  It's a really good question. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2511.0s)]
*  So the standard story of Italy, according to people like Carlo Trogiglia, was that it was [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2512.64s)]
*  public weakness and private strength. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2518.56s)]
*  So more or less, the idea was that you had this ridiculously over elaborated state [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2520.56s)]
*  structure, regulations which made it extremely hard to get things done. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2525.04s)]
*  And you had this incredibly dynamic private sector that managed to survive and to thrive [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2528.8399999999997s)]
*  despite this and to produce to markets elsewhere. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2533.72s)]
*  Now, the question is, I think for Italy, that its big strength was in manufacturing. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2537.04s)]
*  It was not in it was not not in computer science. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2541.84s)]
*  So it's are in any of the new data related economy. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2545.44s)]
*  And so I think Italy's problem is that it is more than anything else. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2549.72s)]
*  It is stuck in a previous cycle and it is it has except in certain areas such as luxury [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2552.92s)]
*  eyewear, which are not going to be to power an economy. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2558.72s)]
*  It has a very it's going to have a very great difficulty in clambering out. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2563.08s)]
*  The interesting question, I think, is to what extent is the Chinese state kind of like [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2566.68s)]
*  Italy writ large? So you can see the same kinds of problems with this massive bloated [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2570.64s)]
*  state sector in China. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2575.96s)]
*  These are big companies which are closely and intimately related with the state. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2577.7999999999997s)]
*  You have these small private companies which have been incredibly powerful, incredibly [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2582.12s)]
*  dynamic, incredibly successful. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2586.3199999999997s)]
*  I wonder whether China may suffer from a version of the Italian disease two or three [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2588.3999999999996s)]
*  decades from now and perhaps even more starkly because of the lack of democracy, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2592.68s)]
*  because you know, because it really, I think, is only possible to maintain that private [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2596.3199999999997s)]
*  dynamism for a period of time while the public economy doesn't [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2601.2799999999997s)]
*  provide for the you know, does not provide the appropriate public goods sooner or later. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2606.48s)]
*  I think it just becomes impossible to maintain. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2611.72s)]
*  The Irish musical group, My Bloody Valentine, overrated or underrated? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2613.96s)]
*  Well, I think this is something that we will agree. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2618.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't think it is possible to underrate or to overrate, rather, My Bloody Valentine. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2621.0s)]
*  They're just incredible. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2626.68s)]
*  And what's their best work? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2627.96s)]
*  So I think that for me, the track on the end of Loveless, Soon, is, I think, one of the [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2629.4s)]
*  most sublime achievements. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2638.08s)]
*  I'm also very fond of Kevin Scheele's MBV orchestra mix of the Primal Scream song, If [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2639.72s)]
*  They Move Kill Him. I think that was released. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  It was released first of all as a B-side and then as a then on their next album. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2648.72s)]
*  I think it's like this kind of this this crazy son ra meets all sorts of strange guitar [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2654.2s)]
*  distortion music. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2659.72s)]
*  I think it's very, very good. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2661.12s)]
*  I think that they really are one of the essential groups. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2663.2s)]
*  And that album, which they released three or four years ago, I don't think was quite as [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2666.2799999999997s)]
*  good as they released back in their heyday, but it was still pretty damn good compared to [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2670.52s)]
*  what most of their contemporaries are doing. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2675.4399999999996s)]
*  For a 20 year hiatus, remarkable, I would say. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2676.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  Finnegans Wake. Is it a readable book? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2679.7200000000003s)]
*  Is it a good book? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2681.44s)]
*  I've never read it. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2682.2000000000003s)]
*  I have a great uncle who features in Ulysses, but I've never read Finnegans Wake. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2683.04s)]
*  What's the role of your great uncle in Ulysses? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2686.6800000000003s)]
*  To appear as a drunk windbag in the Aeolus chapter. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2688.92s)]
*  Was he a drunk windbag? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2691.88s)]
*  He was an interesting character. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2693.44s)]
*  So his real name was Hugh McNeil. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2695.4s)]
*  So he appears as Professor McHugh in the Aeolus chapter. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2697.5600000000004s)]
*  He comes in. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2701.4s)]
*  He makes various remarks about the about about Greek syndrome and the comparison to [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2702.0s)]
*  the Irish and the British, more or less insinuating that the Greeks, like the Irish, are [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2707.6s)]
*  great liars, thieves, tellers of stories, and the Romans and the British are great [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2711.88s)]
*  builders of sewer systems. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2716.52s)]
*  And he was a lecturer in classics, as I recall, at the predecessor to University College [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2718.2s)]
*  Dublin, had problems with gambling, had problems with alcohol and ended up more or less [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2724.24s)]
*  being alienated from his family and dying alone in a boarding house decades after. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2732.0s)]
*  So a rather sad story. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2736.96s)]
*  Speaking of Ireland, say I look at the last 30, 35 years of Irish history and I say [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2738.44s)]
*  Ireland went from being very poor to being one of the wealthier European nations. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2744.0s)]
*  And this, in essence, just shows neoliberalism is correct. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2748.64s)]
*  And we don't need any more from the left. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2751.68s)]
*  What would your response be? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2753.72s)]
*  I would say that there is a certain amount of neoliberalism in there, but maybe not in [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2755.08s)]
*  quite the sense that you suggest. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2760.4s)]
*  Well, OK, well, there are two things. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2762.2s)]
*  First of all, I would say insofar as there is anybody who is identified with neoliberalism [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2763.64s)]
*  in Ireland, it is another family member who is an uncle who is the deputy prime minister [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2767.28s)]
*  of Ireland, Michael McDougall, who I'm very fond of and who I have strong political [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2771.72s)]
*  disagreements with. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2776.92s)]
*  But I think that if one is to look at neoliberalism as a kind of a global power [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2778.04s)]
*  structure, plausibly Ireland managed to figure out very creatively, very ingeniously [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2784.4s)]
*  ways to fit into that power structure that allowed for massive, massive inward [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2789.8s)]
*  investment. So here specifically, I think a lot of what Ireland has done over the last [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2795.12s)]
*  number of years is to figure out a combination of a regulatory play and a and a [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2799.08s)]
*  taxation play. So it has been a relatively lax place in regulating various financial [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2805.0s)]
*  activities, in regulating platform economies, and it has also been relatively willing to [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2811.28s)]
*  facilitate some very exotic tax arrangements. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2816.28s)]
*  I think that the former of these still continues and I think has managed to kickstart a [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2820.28s)]
*  genuine native industry, which I think will continue to do very well. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2825.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that the latter part, the taxation game is coming to an end and it's very clear that [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2830.52s)]
*  it's coming to an end. People in the central bank have been making statements about it, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2834.6400000000003s)]
*  more or less warning the government that the fiscal implications to a cessation of [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2838.88s)]
*  Ireland's ability to finesse the global tax system. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2845.24s)]
*  This is coming to an end and the Irish state is suddenly going to have a fiscal headache as a [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2850.56s)]
*  result, which added to a possible Brexit headache could have some pretty significant [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2854.7999999999997s)]
*  implications. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2859.96s)]
*  Carl Pellany's book, The Great Transformation. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2860.7599999999998s)]
*  What was it, if anything, that he got wrong in there? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2863.36s)]
*  It's a brilliant book. It's had massive influence on Danny Rodrik. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2865.72s)]
*  I think yourself, many other people. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2868.8399999999997s)]
*  Does it have a flaw? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2870.64s)]
*  It has many flaws. So I think it's a really, I think it's a really interesting, good book [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2871.6s)]
*  that everybody ought to read. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2876.64s)]
*  I also think that people ought to read Schumpeter, I think is the book on the right that [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2877.96s)]
*  people need to the capitalism, social democracy, democracy book. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2882.0s)]
*  But what I would say that Pellany is a very, very well, there are two things that are [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2886.52s)]
*  fuzzy in it. First of all is his is his ideal alternative, which is based, I think, in a [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2891.6s)]
*  kind of notion of a specifically, specifically Christian notion of socialism that I think he [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2898.92s)]
*  drives from people like Tony, which I think is very, very hard to create in the modern [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2904.44s)]
*  era. So I think that there's a lot of pretty overt nostalgia for a for a previous, almost [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2909.08s)]
*  quasi medieval sense of organic connection between society and economy, which I think [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2915.96s)]
*  simply cannot be reestablished under liberal conditions. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2921.64s)]
*  And the other thing that, of course, is very, very vague and wafting in Pellany is how it [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2924.84s)]
*  is that quote society unquote reacts against the market, reacts against these depredations of [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2929.2400000000002s)]
*  the marketplace is double movement that he talks about. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2934.64s)]
*  Personally, I tend not to believe in big abstractions such as society as explanations [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2937.56s)]
*  are social causes. So I think that he captures something real. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2944.2s)]
*  And I think if you want alternatively to say what Pellany gets right, I think that there is [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2947.2799999999997s)]
*  something that can be said very plausibly about the ways in which many of the aspects of [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2951.96s)]
*  Trump are alternatively of what we see happening with people like Orban and Kaczynski in [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2957.56s)]
*  Central Eastern Europe, that these can be explained as being reactions against overly harsh [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2963.08s)]
*  market market forces of one sort or another. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2969.12s)]
*  But the specific micro mechanics to which this happens are really, really important. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2972.4s)]
*  And we still haven't really figured out what those micro mechanics are. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2977.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think trying to figure out how to create a better society is really going to force us [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2980.7999999999997s)]
*  to look at this much more specifically than a Pellanian framework would allow us to do. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2985.64s)]
*  Who or what will replace labor unions as the offsetting or special interest group to oppose [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2990.72s)]
*  capitalism or capitalists? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2995.92s)]
*  Can we really count on the urban professionals? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2997.68s)]
*  Aren't they a bunch of spoiled brats? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=2999.88s)]
*  I think labor unions are going to replace labor unions. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3001.52s)]
*  So I think that we're going to. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3003.72s)]
*  Now, that said, this is a kind of a long term bet, which could, of course, turn out to be [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3005.52s)]
*  completely wrong. But I think that it's more or less impossible to imagine a world in which [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3009.48s)]
*  you have protection for large, large segments of the population that doesn't roughly resemble [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3015.2400000000002s)]
*  labor unions. Now, this may be a very, very different just as the platform economy involves [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3021.12s)]
*  a greater degree of disaggregation and standard work practices. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3026.16s)]
*  One could imagine that when we're going to have to see labor unions being very, very [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3029.72s)]
*  different in form. But I think that they're important. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3034.44s)]
*  And it's also very interesting to see people like Asimoglu and Robinson making a very [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3036.64s)]
*  important political case for labor unions, saying that if you're an economist, you can't [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3041.68s)]
*  think about labor unions as being a first best solution because clearly they're about [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3046.24s)]
*  distribution and distribution of stuff to their members. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3050.2s)]
*  But if you're thinking about maintaining the underlying conditions for democracy, which [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3052.7999999999997s)]
*  presumably is a good thing for markets and for capital, then having something like labor [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3057.48s)]
*  unions is necessary. And I think that the way that Niskanen has moved, and in particular [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3061.56s)]
*  the way that people like Brink Lindsey, together with Steve Tellis, have moved towards [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3065.8799999999997s)]
*  endorsement, albeit with a certain amount of grudgery of labor unions, really points to [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3070.4s)]
*  the realization by smart people on the center right and on the libertarian and tinged [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3076.0s)]
*  center right that this is something that that maybe libertarians have gotten wrong over [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3082.6s)]
*  the last couple of decades. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3087.48s)]
*  Sudo Arasmus issued the following tweet a few weeks ago, something like, has any successful [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3088.7999999999997s)]
*  industrial policy been backed by a regime that took the side of labor rather than [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3094.0s)]
*  business? Do you have a response? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3098.72s)]
*  Not off the top of my head. I would have to think about that. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3101.36s)]
*  In terms of trust, you've written a great deal on trust. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3103.96s)]
*  What's the most solid piece of evidence or body of understanding we have on why some [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3106.04s)]
*  societies are higher trust than others? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3110.4s)]
*  Well, I tend to think about trust in terms of institutions. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3112.92s)]
*  So there are different people who have different takes on this. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3115.12s)]
*  Some people talk about trust in terms of this kind of socially, this broad social sense [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3116.96s)]
*  of optimism or happiness and things. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3122.36s)]
*  I tend to think that if you want to have trust, you need to have well-functioning [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3124.48s)]
*  institutions, which... [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3129.12s)]
*  Which that's circular in a way, right? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3130.96s)]
*  Well, it depends on what you say. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3133.44s)]
*  I've got... [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3134.7599999999998s)]
*  I could bore you for hours about how I think that institutions work. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3136.24s)]
*  But if you want to... [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3140.52s)]
*  If you really want to, I guess, get the, you know, the feral sense of the social [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3143.32s)]
*  production function, it's something like the following that you need rough levels of [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3149.6s)]
*  economic inequality, which allow for institutions which are reasonably fair, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3153.92s)]
*  which in turn create the conditions for social trust. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3158.32s)]
*  A little bit on literature. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3162.2000000000003s)]
*  Jean Wolf, Book of the New Sun, four volumes. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3163.4s)]
*  Maybe you know the Monty Python skit where they do summarize Proust? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3167.1600000000003s)]
*  And you have 10 seconds. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3170.4s)]
*  How would you summarize what's in those four volumes? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3172.0s)]
*  Why is it interesting? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3174.1600000000003s)]
*  I would summarize it as Proust with rocket chips and ray guns. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3175.4s)]
*  So I would say summarize Proust... [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3179.52s)]
*  To summarize Wolf, Wolf is Proust with rockets and ray guns. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3182.0s)]
*  Is it introspective? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3185.32s)]
*  It all seems to be in the sphere of action. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3186.88s)]
*  So we never know what the torturer, Severian, is thinking or feeling, or... [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3189.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3193.48s)]
*  It confuses me. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3194.04s)]
*  Is he a good guy, a bad guy? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3195.08s)]
*  I'm never sure. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3196.6s)]
*  Well, we know what he says he's thinking. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3197.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3199.2400000000002s)]
*  Wolf misleads us systematically. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3200.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3201.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, Wolf misleads us systematically. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3202.24s)]
*  And clearly Severian is not a... [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3204.24s)]
*  He is not a reliable narrator, but then neither is Proust's narrator either. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3206.12s)]
*  And I think that if you really want to understand where Wolf comes from, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3210.7599999999998s)]
*  it really is Proust. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3214.2s)]
*  His writing style is Proust, he's Proustian. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3214.96s)]
*  His concern with time, with how it is that time works, is quintessentially Proustian. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3217.8399999999997s)]
*  And you don't look to Wolf any more than you look to other science fiction, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3224.16s)]
*  I think, for characterization. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3228.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't think that's the particular strengths. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3230.2s)]
*  What you do look is for a kind of a sense of the world. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3232.4399999999996s)]
*  And I think in Wolf in particular, you know, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3236.16s)]
*  so he provides this real understanding of how it is that the working society, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3238.48s)]
*  an interestingly conservative understanding of the working society. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3243.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I think of him almost as being Proust in reverse. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3248.04s)]
*  So Proust is describing a world in which the modern world is overtaking aristocracy. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3250.68s)]
*  And that clearly is one of the great problems. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3255.7599999999998s)]
*  Proust is what is happening on the social level, you know, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3257.56s)]
*  that you have all of these aristocratic understandings, these the Mervinjean, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3259.52s)]
*  all of these histories, all of these castles, all of this wonderful art. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3265.44s)]
*  And they are being replaced by the modern world with its telephones, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3269.0s)]
*  with its electric lighting and so on. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3273.44s)]
*  And how do you think about this? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3275.32s)]
*  How do you try to preserve what is happening in the past? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3276.96s)]
*  And what Wolf does, which I think is an extraordinarily interesting thing, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3279.8s)]
*  which I think would be impossible for anybody who's not a science fiction writer, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3283.4s)]
*  is to take that and to reverse this and to imagine a world in which modernity has disappeared. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3286.8799999999997s)]
*  So it is at the other end of the of the telescope. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3292.12s)]
*  It is this tiny image, which is barely discernible. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3295.3199999999997s)]
*  If you look through the telescope the wrong way, it has been surrounded and replaced [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3297.68s)]
*  and to some extent supplemented by medieval ways of thinking, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3302.2s)]
*  medieval ways of organizing the world. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3307.3599999999997s)]
*  And what would that look like? And it's very, very interesting. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3309.6s)]
*  There's this beautiful image, one of my favorite images from the Book of the New Sun. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3312.3599999999997s)]
*  Is of the famous picture that was taken, was it not by Armstrong himself, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3316.56s)]
*  but of Armstrong in his helmet on the moon with Neil Armstrong, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3321.96s)]
*  with the flag in the background and the reflection of the other astronaut. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3327.6000000000004s)]
*  And and so Wolf has this and has it as a you know, this is a picture [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3331.2400000000002s)]
*  which has been preserved for thousands of years, perhaps in this in this art gallery, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3337.1200000000003s)]
*  which is maintained in this forgotten citadel. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3342.52s)]
*  And so he gives you this wonderful sense of what it would be to have an image like that [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3345.12s)]
*  taken and ripped entirely out of context and seen through an entirely alien set of eyes. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3349.88s)]
*  And that's what science fiction does when it does it well, is to make the strange, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3355.44s)]
*  familiar and the familiar strange and the novalis sense of the word. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3359.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think that, you know, that's that's why for me, Wolf is a head trip. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3362.92s)]
*  Philip K. Dick, in his worldview, why do checks and balances fail in a democracy? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3366.8s)]
*  How do things go wrong? Right. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3373.32s)]
*  We're America. We vote for people. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3374.9599999999996s)]
*  They give us things. We live, we die. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3376.64s)]
*  What's the actual problem? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3378.72s)]
*  So I think that Dick's Dick's understanding of politics is at least his [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3379.8799999999997s)]
*  his intellectual understanding of politics is not his strength. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3385.12s)]
*  So he has this clearly he's got this very strong paranoid streak. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3388.0s)]
*  Everything is about Richard Nixon, which I suppose is not unreasonable, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3392.56s)]
*  given the way that the world is. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3397.3599999999997s)]
*  What I think Dick gets much, much better than his sense of politics as such [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3399.24s)]
*  are for that matter than a sense of character, because he is absolutely [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3404.3999999999996s)]
*  terrible in character, especially when it comes to women characters. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3408.3599999999997s)]
*  His women characters are all [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3411.3999999999996s)]
*  they are all expressions of Dick's own personal anxieties in one way or another. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3413.8399999999997s)]
*  What he gets better is the sense of massive complex systems [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3418.16s)]
*  that don't work particularly well, the kinds of constraints [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3422.68s)]
*  that they impose upon individuals and the kinds of ways that people try [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3426.8399999999997s)]
*  to respond to those constraints. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3430.24s)]
*  And also, of course, the sense of profound unreality in his novels, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3431.92s)]
*  which I think is really why Dick much more than say Orwell or Huxley [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3435.2400000000002s)]
*  or any of the other people you might think of. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3439.12s)]
*  Zamiatun is really the person who captures the kind of dystopian [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3441.2000000000003s)]
*  characteristics of the society that we live in at the moment, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3444.88s)]
*  which isn't a society where we have a stage telling everybody what to think. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3447.52s)]
*  But it's a world in which nobody knows quite what to believe is true anymore. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3451.08s)]
*  And you have multiple different versions of the truth. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3454.76s)]
*  Philip K. Dick would have just reveled in QAnon. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3457.32s)]
*  I think he would have had a very, very good sense of how it is [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3459.64s)]
*  that we could end up in a world with people like Donald Trump and QAnon [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3463.2s)]
*  reinforcing each other in a kind of a feedback loop. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3467.16s)]
*  And what's the best of his creations and what's the most important? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3469.7999999999997s)]
*  And are they the same? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3472.72s)]
*  So the best of his creations, if you want to think of the best as a novel, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3473.7999999999997s)]
*  I think is the Transmigration of Timothy Archer, which I think is plausibly [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3477.64s)]
*  the only genuinely good novel that he wrote and also is the only novel [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3481.0s)]
*  that has a sympathetic and interesting female character in it. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3485.12s)]
*  But it's not his most important work. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3489.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's it's good at showing that towards the end, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3491.08s)]
*  he managed to get some kind of a sense of himself from outside [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3495.12s)]
*  and of perspective on his struggles with mental health, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3499.28s)]
*  which clearly were both a driving creative force for him [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3502.6s)]
*  and a source of much personal agony and destruction. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3505.52s)]
*  I think that the works that are most important, I think, are Ubik [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3509.36s)]
*  and Martian Timeslip. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3513.12s)]
*  Both of these, I think, captured these are the most [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3515.2000000000003s)]
*  the quintessential Dick novels about how it is that reality can break up [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3517.8s)]
*  and what it feels like to be in that kind of world. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3522.84s)]
*  So if I think again about the kinds of what I feel depressed about, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3524.96s)]
*  the way in which somebody like Donald Trump seems to dominate [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3529.0s)]
*  in very unhealthy ways, our collective imagination so that [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3533.76s)]
*  it's almost impossible to get away from. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3538.0s)]
*  I really think about one of the kinds of psychic predators [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3540.0800000000004s)]
*  that Wolf describes, you know, sort of Jory Graham, I think it is. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3543.5200000000004s)]
*  If my memory is correct, in Ubik, you know, this is kind of very, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3547.2s)]
*  very the sense of the world in which all of these paths [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3549.8399999999997s)]
*  converge towards a single actor who just gobbles up all of our attention. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3553.16s)]
*  So, you know, Dick doesn't have any very plausible way of getting out from that. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3557.68s)]
*  You know, if he suggests more or less that we need some kind of divine intervention. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3562.7599999999998s)]
*  But I think it captures some of the reasons why the world that we live in [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3566.6s)]
*  very often feels so unpleasant, even when we don't want to pay attention [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3571.48s)]
*  to Donald Trump in the United States, we find everybody around us [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3575.4s)]
*  wants to pay attention to Donald Trump and Trump, if nothing else, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3578.44s)]
*  seems to have a unique mastery of the skill of remaining at the center of attention. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3582.2400000000002s)]
*  A few questions about Ireland. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3586.92s)]
*  What do you miss about Ireland the most? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3588.4s)]
*  What I miss is also what I'm happy to get away from, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3590.08s)]
*  which is the sense of comfort and belonging. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3592.04s)]
*  So Ireland is a very small country. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3594.2400000000002s)]
*  Within 60 seconds of having met another Irish person, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3596.2000000000003s)]
*  you probably have figured out who that person's family are, where they come from. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3599.2000000000003s)]
*  You will have made a wide variety of inferences about what kind of person [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3603.3599999999997s)]
*  they are, what their plausible political beliefs are and so on. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3607.4399999999996s)]
*  And that's very, very comforting to be in. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3611.0s)]
*  It's also somewhat constraining and constricting. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3613.2s)]
*  So what I love about the United States is the precise opposite [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3615.3999999999996s)]
*  that nobody much cares about where you come from, where you come from. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3619.4399999999996s)]
*  They if they think about Ireland at all, they think about it as being a small, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3623.12s)]
*  quaint place with leprechauns and green fields and what have you. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3626.8399999999997s)]
*  And so you have a much greater opportunity to make yourself [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3630.88s)]
*  and to decide who you are in the United States than in Ireland. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3634.2s)]
*  And at least if you are, if you have the economic wherewithal to do it, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3638.12s)]
*  that makes Ireland in some ways a much more confining, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3643.0s)]
*  a much more restrictive way place than the United States. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3646.48s)]
*  Again, assuming that you have enough money in the United States [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3649.32s)]
*  to be able to realize yourself. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3652.04s)]
*  Why did Ireland seem to secularize faster than just about any other country [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3654.7599999999998s)]
*  in world history? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3658.88s)]
*  Right. Less than 30 years. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3660.56s)]
*  Now the rate of church going is very low. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3661.92s)]
*  It used to be one of the most religious Catholic places. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3663.84s)]
*  I think that it's a it's what's his name, Timur Koran. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3667.04s)]
*  I think that this is a Timur Koran story where you have the set of beliefs [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3670.64s)]
*  and expectations which are mutually reinforcing because everybody believes [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3676.16s)]
*  that everybody else believes them and that when this collapses, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3680.16s)]
*  the collapse can happen very, very quickly indeed. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3683.56s)]
*  So I think we saw a massive wave of preference revelation happening [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3685.88s)]
*  and it's pretty possible to pinpoint the point at which it happened. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3689.7999999999997s)]
*  One of my professors was a character called Brian Farrell, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3694.52s)]
*  who was very well known for being quite careful and reticent [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3697.64s)]
*  because he was also a television broadcaster. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3702.12s)]
*  He ran the Big Ireland Current Affairs Show. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3705.0s)]
*  And then one day we had a the revelation that a bishop [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3708.08s)]
*  who had become the spokesperson for the Irish Church had been found [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3712.6s)]
*  to have had a child and have been supporting that child for 17 years [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3716.92s)]
*  using church funds. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3720.96s)]
*  And that morning, I thought the following morning, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3722.28s)]
*  I saw Brian in the car parking University College Dublin, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3725.2400000000002s)]
*  and I saw him in absolute glee saying, the bastards, they've lost. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3728.0s)]
*  Finally, the bastards have lost. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3731.44s)]
*  And he was right, because at that moment, the the stranglehold, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3733.16s)]
*  which a certain version of conservatism had held on Ireland, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3736.8s)]
*  it began to evaporate very, very quickly. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3740.8s)]
*  And after that, I think that the [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3743.64s)]
*  the the having the church as the center of society, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3745.84s)]
*  at the center of all these social functions, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3750.0s)]
*  all of these things began to disappear. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3752.04s)]
*  Material prosperity helped substantially as well. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3754.52s)]
*  But I really think that this was the reason why it happened so fast [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3757.12s)]
*  was because it should have happened 20 or 25 years before. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3759.84s)]
*  And it took a shock to the system to really cause this kind of this cascade [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3764.08s)]
*  of norm of normed generation. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3768.36s)]
*  So the people switched rapidly from one equilibrium to another. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3770.32s)]
*  Last but not least, the Henry Farrell production function. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3773.6s)]
*  So at Crooked Timber, you have a lot of readers, right? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3776.76s)]
*  We do, although I feel guilty because I haven't been writing [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3779.8s)]
*  nearly as much in Crooked Timber as I would like to. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3782.12s)]
*  But in the equilibrium, why aren't there more crooked timbers? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3785.28s)]
*  What is the scarce input? Right. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3788.52s)]
*  Why are people like readers? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3791.32s)]
*  So I think I think that Crooked Timber, I think that we had a useful catalyst function. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3792.96s)]
*  I think that if you look at the world today, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3798.32s)]
*  that there are a lot of people who are able to do the things [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3801.6s)]
*  that we were able to do in different mediums. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3804.3199999999997s)]
*  So if you look at the world that we began writing in, this was the world where [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3806.3199999999997s)]
*  the Iraq War was beginning. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3811.3199999999997s)]
*  I think we started writing just around the time that the that the Iraq War took off, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3814.16s)]
*  in which there wasn't much of an organized left [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3819.2s)]
*  and a coherent and systematic intellectual left in the United States. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3821.96s)]
*  There was more of one in the United Kingdom. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3825.52s)]
*  And so I think that in a sense that that isn't true anymore. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3828.04s)]
*  If you look at the if you look at the left, you may disagree [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3832.08s)]
*  or you may agree with what it says. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3835.7599999999998s)]
*  But there is a lot of thriving debate. There is a lot of argument. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3837.44s)]
*  There are a whole bunch of journals, schisms, factions, all of these things. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3840.32s)]
*  You know, so much more lively, much more thriving intellectual debate [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3845.2799999999997s)]
*  than there was back then. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3848.44s)]
*  So in a sense, we came into being at a moment when I think that the [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3849.72s)]
*  a lot of the energy of the left had run out. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3853.2799999999997s)]
*  So you had places like dissent and other places which were really running on [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3855.28s)]
*  the accumulated energy of the 1960s and 1970s, but which weren't particularly strongly. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3859.96s)]
*  They weren't oriented towards the present day circumstances that they found themselves in. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3866.1200000000003s)]
*  Now, I think we're in a very different world where there just isn't as much need [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3871.0s)]
*  for crooked timber as there used to be, because there are so many other places [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3875.2000000000003s)]
*  where people can write, where people can argue, where people can find things to say. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3878.92s)]
*  And it's I think it's a very interesting intellectual phenomenon and that that that you [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3882.52s)]
*  you have a vibrant left, which is also beginning to engage with the policy process, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3887.52s)]
*  I think, again, in a way that it hasn't for a long, long time. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3891.76s)]
*  If you think about just in general how you study things, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3894.52s)]
*  what is something you do that's not obvious and maybe most other intellectuals do not do? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3897.56s)]
*  You read Standing on Your Head, you go for long walks in the rain. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3903.84s)]
*  What's well, I think what do I do? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3906.6s)]
*  That's unusual. I would say I read widely [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3911.48s)]
*  and I play with a lot of ideas, most of which don't come to fruition. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3916.72s)]
*  So this is and again, this is one of the advantage of social media [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3921.4399999999996s)]
*  that you can toy with an idea. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3925.8399999999997s)]
*  You can turn it into a micro thread of three or four things on Twitter [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3927.72s)]
*  and you can throw it out into the world and you can see if it sticks. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3931.2799999999997s)]
*  You can see if it grabs attention. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3934.3199999999997s)]
*  You can also see if you've worked it out to your own satisfaction. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3935.8799999999997s)]
*  And most of the time, that's not going to work. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3938.96s)]
*  It's most of our intellectual products are failures. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3941.2400000000002s)]
*  But we live in a world where it's possible to throw to throw these failures [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3944.92s)]
*  at a far, far more rapid rate at other people and try to figure out what [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3949.48s)]
*  what works then in the past. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3954.4s)]
*  And so I found that to be an extremely useful way of [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3956.32s)]
*  of thinking through things and playing with initial ideas. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3959.52s)]
*  So a kind of combinatorial iteration. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3963.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So effectively, you know, you can think about it as a [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3964.96s)]
*  evolutionary dynamic that that, you know, this is a system in which it becomes, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3967.92s)]
*  you know, you throw out variations. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3972.08s)]
*  Most of those variations fail. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3974.0s)]
*  Some of those variations take root and then those variations [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3975.68s)]
*  can succeed far, far better. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3978.2799999999997s)]
*  What's your favorite movie? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3979.84s)]
*  That's the kind of question. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3981.16s)]
*  Secrets and lies, actually. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3983.0s)]
*  Mike Lee's secrets and lies. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3984.04s)]
*  Last question, your plans for the future intellectually, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3985.68s)]
*  what you will write or what you will do. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3988.56s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3990.08s)]
*  Well, what I'm really interested in at the moment, two things. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3991.16s)]
*  First of all, the weaponized independence work, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3994.72s)]
*  which we've talked about already. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3996.68s)]
*  So it probably doesn't bear much more talking about. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=3997.9199999999996s)]
*  No, the world will cooperate and serve you much more content. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4000.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. The world and the world is maybe cooperating too much. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4003.48s)]
*  Myself, my co-author are finding ourselves. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4007.24s)]
*  We joke that we're on a treadmill because stuff keeps on happening. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4010.2s)]
*  People keep on asking us to write stuff. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4013.68s)]
*  And it's fun and it's exciting and it's wonderful to see your ideas [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4015.7999999999997s)]
*  go out there into the world. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4019.08s)]
*  But it also it also requires a lot of work to keep peddling. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4020.3199999999997s)]
*  And also, and I think this is the plausible fate of anybody [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4024.8399999999997s)]
*  who has a idea that takes off. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4029.04s)]
*  You see the idea effectively escaping your control. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4031.08s)]
*  So people are talking about weaponized independence with respect to a much [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4033.48s)]
*  wider and broader and diffuse range of phenomena than what we talked about. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4037.6s)]
*  And that's just the way that these things work. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4041.16s)]
*  Second thing that I'm interested in is the informational content of democracy. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4043.16s)]
*  So here maybe the intuition is something like the following. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4047.72s)]
*  So we have a standard set of arguments that have been extremely [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4051.24s)]
*  influential among libertarians and I think more broadly in the world, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4055.36s)]
*  which are derived from people like Hayek. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4059.7599999999998s)]
*  We have this this set of arguments which are beautifully expressed [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4061.56s)]
*  and which I think are very important arguments that Hayek makes about how markets [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4065.92s)]
*  work extraordinarily well to gather all of this diffuse information, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4069.72s)]
*  this information, which is simply unencoded and to make it into something [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4074.48s)]
*  that can be useful by through the through the price mechanism. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4078.44s)]
*  So the price mechanism takes all of this tacit knowledge [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4082.6s)]
*  and makes it actionable in important ways. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4085.2400000000002s)]
*  The Hayek and the Mises story is, of course, one where they contrast [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4088.76s)]
*  this with state planning and they argue very plausibly that if you look [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4092.76s)]
*  at central planning processes, that these central planning processes [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4097.08s)]
*  are never plausibly going to be able to compete with [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4100.4400000000005s)]
*  with the market, at least for doing that kind of thing. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4104.24s)]
*  I think that states can do lots of other things. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4107.36s)]
*  I think that they underestimate that, but that's a different argument. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4109.48s)]
*  What I also think is that democracy, democracy also has a set of techniques [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4112.639999999999s)]
*  or tools for capturing information because and again, this is going back [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4118.36s)]
*  in a certain way to what I was saying about the the Gellner or the proper view [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4121.88s)]
*  of society, which is more or less that we have all of these people [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4126.84s)]
*  with different understandings, different aims, different aspirations within society. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4129.76s)]
*  And you want to do two things. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4134.36s)]
*  First of all, you want to maintain peace among all of these quarreling [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4135.68s)]
*  these quarreling people with their very different aims and aspirations. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4139.0s)]
*  You want to try and figure out how you can stop them from going to war [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4142.16s)]
*  with each other. But secondly, there also is going to be a lot of information [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4145.12s)]
*  which is captured precisely in their disagreements, in their differences, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4149.68s)]
*  in their differing perspectives. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4153.76s)]
*  And so my ideal for democracy is as a machinery to try and get [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4155.360000000001s)]
*  as much information out of those differences as possible, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4160.08s)]
*  to take things like partisanship, which is messy and rancorous [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4163.36s)]
*  and squalid much of the time, but to recognise that the clash of [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4166.92s)]
*  debate of different ideas, the clash of perspectives also has a lot of information [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4171.76s)]
*  value and does things that markets can't capture. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4176.2s)]
*  So trying to think through much more systematically, what are the modes [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4179.48s)]
*  under which democracy is better or worse at doing this? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4183.08s)]
*  What are the kinds of institutions that allows democracy to do this better, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4186.44s)]
*  better or worse? This, I think, is a major set of questions. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4189.639999999999s)]
*  Obviously, there are lots of other people who are doing good things on it. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4193.0s)]
*  But if I think about the other work that I'm doing with people like [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4195.96s)]
*  Cosma Shlizzi, who you are familiar with, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4200.08s)]
*  with Hugo Mercier and Melissa Schwartzberg, these are the kinds of ideas [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4204.2s)]
*  that we're trying to get at. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4207.92s)]
*  And also work with Bruce Schneier, which is thinking about the opposite [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4209.280000000001s)]
*  side of this, which is that democracy is likely to be overwhelmed [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4212.96s)]
*  under circumstances where people disagree too much on basic facts, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4216.400000000001s)]
*  some basic information. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4220.44s)]
*  And in what ways can you try to make democracy less vulnerable [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4221.719999999999s)]
*  and more robust against various forms of informational attacks, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4225.719999999999s)]
*  not only Russian type attacks, but the kinds of attacks that domestic [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4229.759999999999s)]
*  political actors seek to use in order to pursue their own short term aims. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4233.04s)]
*  Henry Farrell, thank you very much. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vVwdgcsu0s&t=4238.36s)]
