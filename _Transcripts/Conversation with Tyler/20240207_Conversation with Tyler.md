*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm chatting with Amy Vitale.
*  She is a National Geographic photographer, writer, speaker, and documentary filmmaker.
*  She's been a wartime conflict photographer for about 10 years.
*  She is an important figure in the animal conservation movement and she's traveled to more than a
*  hundred countries.
*  She's author of the 2018 bestselling book Panda Love and she is founder and director
*  of a new nonprofit for arts education around the world called Vital Impacts.
*  You can see her work on her homepage.
*  If you Google her, that's Amy AMI, Amy Vitale, and also on Instagram.
*  Amy, welcome.
*  Thank you, Tyler.
*  It's wonderful to be with you today.
*  Why is it that human panda keepers dress up as pandas?
*  Well the thinking was that pandas should never be comfortable around humans because
*  humans are one of the biggest threats to most wild animals.
*  And in this case, these were captive born pandas who were being trained to go back to
*  the wild because after one generation in captivity, they do not know how to survive in the wild.
*  And so the lucky pandas that were chosen to be a part of this program, they didn't want
*  them interacting with humans.
*  And the main point about it is that these costumes, it was more pandas go by smell,
*  not sight.
*  So the panda costumes were actually scented with panda urine.
*  The thought was that they should not know that humans were around them.
*  So you and I should stay scary to the pandas.
*  We should stay scary to the pandas.
*  And I don't know if it worked, but I thought it was a creative idea in China's efforts
*  to get these pandas off the endangered species list.
*  Now I understand that in the 1960s, the survival rate for panda babies was pretty low.
*  I think you mentioned once 30%.
*  And right now it's about 90%.
*  What accounts for that difference?
*  What is it we're getting right now?
*  Well, it's such a great story.
*  I mean, the truth is, I think the most important thing is that they did a great job of making
*  the world fall in love with pandas.
*  And more importantly, the people living closest to the pandas.
*  Pandas were poached for a long time.
*  And I think harsher policing, harsher laws if you poached a panda, and then really just
*  making the world fall in love with this creature really did a lot for panda conservation.
*  And then there was another piece, which was they understood that the pandas were endangered
*  in the wild.
*  And so they did a few things.
*  They had a breeding program because they wanted to have the number was 300 pandas in captivity
*  in case they went extinct in the wild.
*  And it was actually they managed to crack the code, learn how to breed them in captivity,
*  and now are releasing them back into the wild.
*  And then the last important piece of it is China is one of the few countries in the world
*  where forest coverage is actually growing.
*  And they are reforesting areas, connecting existing corridors where pandas live so that
*  they can move when there's droughts and there's bamboo die-offs and basically giving them
*  space to survive.
*  That is probably the most essential thing we can do around the world for all of wildlife.
*  Speaking of breeding, can you explain to me the Darwinian equilibrium with pandas?
*  If I have this right, the females are fertile for only a few days a year, and actually pandas
*  themselves don't already know how to do it.
*  Why would they have evolved that way?
*  How does that make sense?
*  I actually think that's a bit of a myth.
*  They were thought to be a species without a sex drive.
*  But actually, the truth is they're just very elusive animals.
*  They do have this tiny window to breed.
*  And when the factors in the wild are not so difficult for them, they're fine.
*  I think a lot of it was deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and that was a huge piece of
*  the breeding in the wild.
*  But then in captivity, they were trying to breed them for about two decades with no success.
*  They didn't realize these two factors.
*  One, that they have this tiny window, and two, that the females need choice to breed.
*  You just can't put any old male panda together with them.
*  Once they realize these two things, they have a very successful breeding program.
*  Now scientists are rethinking this idea about the species without a sex drive.
*  They do.
*  What's the proper allocation mechanism for pandas across countries, across zoos?
*  I'm sure you know the US is about to lose its pandas.
*  Who should decide how pandas get allocated?
*  That's a great question.
*  To be honest, I think it's really a symbol of our relations.
*  I think many people know this, but the panda was gifted in the beginning.
*  They were gifted to countries and used as a diplomatic tool.
*  The first one was gifted to Nixon, I believe, in this country.
*  I'm not a politician, so I don't know, but I get the sense that it is symbolic of what's
*  happening between our nations.
*  I don't know the answer to this, but I think that the Chinese own these bears, and it is
*  their choice to do and to loan them to whatever.
*  This is their choice.
*  Do you think animals have rights of privacy at all?
*  Oh, wow.
*  I mean, now we're getting into territory that honestly I wish we didn't have to have captive
*  animals.
*  Ideally, we would not.
*  I don't myself enjoy seeing animals in captivity, and I think that we've come to such a place
*  that in order to keep species alive, the reason that some species are still here with us today
*  are because of scientists sort of seeing into the future, and a lot of great conservation
*  efforts are happening because of zoos.
*  Let's switch this now to the case of the northern white rhinos.
*  They would actually be extinct right now.
*  If it were not for, I believe it was the 60s, I'm not sure on that, but the Dver Kralove
*  Zoo brought northern white rhinos from the wild into the zoo, and if it were not for
*  them, they would now be extinct.
*  I have really mixed feelings about all of this.
*  Until we get into a better place as human beings, I see a value, but not all zoos are
*  the same, not all captive animals are the same, and I think we also need to change our
*  understanding.
*  I think Jane Goodall and many other people have figured out that these creatures are
*  sentient, they're intelligent life, and I actually was just speaking to a woman that
*  did research on dolphins, and she said something very interesting.
*  Dolphins have been around for many, many millions of years, and she believes that they have
*  evolved not just to have this heightened sense of empathy, but she believes that they
*  actually understand that another dolphin's suffering is their own suffering.
*  And I really, I love thinking about this.
*  I love this idea that if we as humans can really start to understand that all of our
*  suffering is the suffering of others.
*  Animals understand that.
*  I think elephants understand that.
*  I've witnessed that with orphaned herds and how much they care for each other.
*  I think my great hope for humanity is that we too can evolve to really understand and
*  feel one another's suffering and joy, and that to me is the only way we're going to
*  exist in the future.
*  As you probably know, there's a long-standing and recurring set of debates between animal
*  welfare advocates and environmentalists, and the animal welfare advocates typically have
*  less sympathy for the predators because they in turn kill other animals.
*  The environmentalists are more likely to think we should in some way leave nature alone as
*  much as possible.
*  Where do you stand on that debate?
*  It depends.
*  It's hard to make a general sweeping statement on this because in some cases I think that
*  we do have to get involved.
*  I think also the fact is it's humans in most cases who have really impacted the environment,
*  and we do need to get engaged and work to restore that balance.
*  I really fall on both sides of this.
*  I will say I do think that is in some cases what differentiates us because we as human
*  beings have to kill to survive.
*  Maybe that is where this…
*  I feel like every story I work on has a different answer.
*  I don't know.
*  It depends what the situation is.
*  Should we bring animals back to landscapes where they have not existed for millions of
*  years?
*  I fall in the line of no.
*  Maybe I'm taking this in a totally different direction.
*  But yeah, it's really complicated, and there's not one easy answer.
*  We have another Conversations guest, Stuart Brand, as you probably know.
*  He is trying to bring back, for instance, the woolly mammoth.
*  Why shouldn't we do it?
*  And the dodo and the thylacine.
*  And more to come, perhaps, right?
*  When I first heard about the story to bring back these extinct species, I thought it was
*  a waste of money and insane.
*  When I actually met people from the colossal projects, and I've really changed my thinking
*  on this, I think that they, in some cases, I don't know that they'll get there in our
*  lifetime, but they have a really good argument for the woolly mammoth.
*  They believe that bringing species back to landscapes where they've been gone can serve
*  a function in the same way bringing wolves back to Yellowstone is.
*  It restores the ecosystem and restores that balance that is missing.
*  They believe that by bringing the woolly mammoth back, they will churn up that soil and kind
*  of serve in the way that bison served in the landscapes here in Montana.
*  The same thing happened.
*  I'll explain that a little more, that you need to keep that land healthy.
*  When you don't have the hooves and the animals grazing and working that landscape, it actually
*  starts to suffer.
*  You need all these animals to create a healthy ecosystem.
*  When you take out the keystone species, the whole land starts to suffer and it trickles
*  down to all the different species.
*  What they're thinking is by bringing the woolly mammoth back, it's going to restore the landscape.
*  I actually think they have a much more interesting function, which as a company, they actually
*  are working with species that are close to extinction but are still here.
*  For example, they're teaming up with the Northern White Rhino and the Bio Rescue Project.
*  They're going to be using their, by basically adding genetic diversity back to the embryos
*  that they've created.
*  The Bio Rescue Project has created 29 viable embryos that they'll use Southern White Rhino
*  surrogates to restore this species.
*  They only have two Northern White Rhino females alive and they're using just one female, her
*  eggs, to create these embryos.
*  They need more genetic diversity and Colossal is able to go into museum specimens and add
*  genetic diversity.
*  I think that they have a really important value and whether woolly mammoths are brought
*  back, maybe it will happen in 100 years from now.
*  I don't know if we'll see this in our lifetime.
*  Maybe we will, but I think that there's value more for the species that are currently here.
*  We need to help the species, these keystone species, because actually I've seen it.
*  I've seen environments like I work a lot in Northern Kenya and there are landscapes where
*  keystone species have been locally extinct for about 30 years and you really see how
*  it starts to impact the entire ecosystem.
*  And then I've seen the reverse where they brought back these animals to these ecosystems
*  and it's amazing how resilient nature is when they give it a chance.
*  You bring it back.
*  We've seen examples in Yellowstone, in Northern Kenya when they brought rhinos and elephants
*  back to these landscapes.
*  And literally within five, 10 years, you start to see the whole environment start to heal.
*  For example, elephants like tread up that grass.
*  They're like huge mobile composting units.
*  The grass starts to grow.
*  Other species return.
*  Then it ultimately helps human beings.
*  So I see all of us, I think that's the main thing is like how do we start to see that
*  we are part of this beautiful web and that every piece matters.
*  So back to Stuart and his work with Colossal, I see a value in it.
*  And I was very suspicious because I think very often people use these headlines to get
*  attention and you have to kind of read through the headlines and really understand what is
*  happening and in this case, I see some value there.
*  Now you have a movie on your home page, which I would recommend to everyone, where you're
*  spending a lot of time photographing and filming rhinos.
*  Why isn't that more dangerous than it seems to be?
*  Well the rhinos that I'm working with were born in captivity, sadly, so they are used
*  to humans.
*  I don't recommend working with wild rhinos in the same way and actually these rhinos
*  know my smell, they know who I am.
*  I've been working with them now for over 15 years.
*  But I think the saddest part of this story is the loss of a wild, there are no more wild
*  northern white rhinos.
*  And I would say that to me is the biggest tragedy.
*  I feel like when we, you know, it's not just the loss of an ecosystem, which is, you know,
*  important in itself.
*  You know, on this other level, I feel like we are losing something so, so much a part
*  of ourselves.
*  Like we're losing what it means to be wild.
*  We are animals too.
*  And when we lose all these wild animals, we're losing what it means to be wild.
*  And on a philosophical level, I realize it's like a loss of wonder and the wild of who
*  we are when we lose so many species.
*  I'm sure all your listeners understand that we're going through the sixth mass extinction,
*  which is, you know, purely human driven.
*  And to me, it's like, I feel like we're losing a piece of ourselves right now.
*  Do Kenyan villagers wish there were more elephants or fewer elephants around?
*  Oh, great question.
*  It depends who you ask.
*  And I'm glad you brought up Kenya.
*  I think Kenya is one of the greatest success stories right now.
*  So they have really made this incredible shift from, you know, 20, 30 years ago.
*  All of their rhinos and elephants and so many other species were being poached to extinction.
*  And Kenya made this big shift.
*  So today, the greatest threat to these species is not poaching.
*  It is actually climate change.
*  And how did they do it?
*  How is Kenya so different from other countries?
*  Well, I think it's a few things.
*  Greater policing, stricter laws.
*  But the main thing is there is community engagement in protecting these creatures.
*  The communities living closest to the animals understand their value to them.
*  And so, you know, during the pandemic, when the tourism stopped and so many other countries
*  were facing poaching levels that had never been seen, for example, in South Africa during
*  the pandemic, over 400 rhinos were poached.
*  Guess how many rhinos were poached in Kenya?
*  Zero.
*  Why is that?
*  It's because the communities understood that they need these wild animals, not just for
*  healthy ecosystems, for their own survival.
*  They understood that, you know, that tourists need, you know, they need them for tourism.
*  They need them for a healthy ecosystem.
*  So it's not that these animals are, you know, difficult.
*  They will come in and eat farmers' crops in one day that they've spent months, you know,
*  cultivating.
*  These animals are dangerous.
*  They're wild animals.
*  They present threats to people.
*  I think in the West, we no longer understand what it means to live with wild animals.
*  People in many places around the world understand what it is to live with wild animals.
*  But I think Kenyans actually understand that they need to protect these animals and the
*  government is more involved in trying to support communities when elephants and rhinos and,
*  you know, there's loss of life, loss of crops, and they're trying to actively figure out
*  ways how do you coexist with these creatures.
*  But I love that you brought up Kenya because, you know, honestly, as foreigners, it is a
*  place that all of us can go.
*  Our tourism dollars can make a huge impact.
*  You know, I think as we're all in this, you know, big ecosystem and we need to figure
*  out where we should support conservation efforts.
*  And Kenya is one of them because if you take the time to figure out where your tourism
*  dollars are going to support communities, that is going to have a huge impact on how
*  the communities take care of the wildlife.
*  What did you find to be most surprising or most interesting in the culture of the Samburu
*  in northern Kenya?
*  Well, I keep learning, but I think that they teach me so much.
*  You know, I think that it's really important to remember the communities living with the
*  wildlife are their greatest protectors.
*  And that is the case with the Samburu, certainly.
*  I met them, gosh, now it's 13, 14 years ago, and they had a dream back then to protect
*  the wildlife.
*  That community also suffered gangs of poachers coming in and poaching the wildlife.
*  And this was a community pushing back and saying, we need to protect the wildlife because
*  we need them for our own survival, too.
*  And so against all odds, they created the first indigenous-owned elephant sanctuary
*  in all of Africa.
*  And back when I first met them, it was just a dream.
*  And many people laughed at them and thought, there's no way you're going to be able to
*  make an elephant sanctuary because they're expensive and you don't have the political
*  power, you don't have the funding.
*  But they did it.
*  And I've been following along on their journey.
*  And it's really extraordinary.
*  It's called Ritedi Elephant Sanctuary.
*  I hope anybody interested who has the means can go and visit this place because what they're
*  doing is changing not just how people there relate to wild animals, but how they relate
*  to each other.
*  It's also the first elephant sanctuary that hires indigenous women to be elephant keepers
*  in a very patriarchal society.
*  And it's transforming a lot.
*  And they're doing things differently there.
*  It's so interesting.
*  Like another story, they've made huge impacts in our understanding of elephant behavior.
*  And also one of the great discoveries during the pandemic was they were worried about what
*  would happen.
*  So when an elephant is orphaned, they have to switch overnight from drinking its mother's
*  milk to drinking a powdered milk formula that is really made for human babies.
*  And 50% of the time around the world in all elephant sanctuaries, that is the most dangerous
*  time for orphans.
*  They come into the sanctuary and they often can't handle that transition from drinking
*  their own mother's milk to a powdered milk formula.
*  And so 50% of the time they die.
*  So Riteddy got worried during the pandemic about what would happen if we can't even get
*  a hold of the powdered milk formula because of supply chains breaking down.
*  So they started looking at nature for solutions.
*  And they discovered that goats eat the same browse, the same vegetation as elephants do.
*  They started experimenting and they made perhaps one of their greatest discoveries.
*  They went from a 50% survival rate to a 98% survival rate.
*  So now these babies come into the sanctuary and they're able to make that transition.
*  And then another piece of the story, which I love, is that all that money that was being
*  sent outside the country to big multinational milk companies are now, that money is all
*  staying within the community.
*  And I went with the Milk Mamas is what they call them.
*  It's the women Samburu who own the goats and they set up bank accounts for the first
*  time in their lives.
*  They're able to send their kids to school to have money for health care.
*  It's absolutely changing the whole community and the people there always tell me,
*  it's not us saving the baby elephants.
*  The elephants are saving us.
*  And I just love watching all the discoveries they keep making.
*  And they have had a long relationship over generations, you know, living with wildlife
*  and they have so much, I think, to teach all of us.
*  I think there is this great understanding happening around the world that there's so
*  much knowledge.
*  We as, you know, Westerners, I think, need to start listening to some of the knowledge
*  that is right there with the people living closest to these creatures.
*  Now you did conflict photojournalism for about 10 years.
*  I mean, risk aside, was it fun?
*  No.
*  Why do it for 10 years?
*  Oh, I think it was the extraordinary people I met.
*  And it began because I just wanted to understand this world and why we have this so much
*  suffering and how do these conflicts emerge?
*  I was never one of those adrenaline junkies.
*  I mean, so many of my friends really, you know, hopped from one conflict to the next
*  and it was like parachute journalism.
*  And I, in the beginning, started my career and I was asked to go to, actually, the first
*  conflict I covered was Gaza.
*  And then I was asked to actually know.
*  The first was Kosovo and the Balkan conflict and then to Gaza and the second Intivada.
*  And, you know, I actually immediately understood that I could not do parachute journalism,
*  that it is really important to take time to understand these stories that we're covering.
*  And I think what, I mean, I ended up living in Kashmir for four years to cover the war
*  between India and Pakistan and taking that time to listen, to truly hear people's stories.
*  But I think what drew me in was the people I met.
*  I mean, I am always shocked at, in these places that are so brutal, where you see the worst
*  of humanity.
*  I also met the people, the best of humanity that taught me so much.
*  They kept me coming back.
*  And I think after 10 years of that, that's when I really shifted.
*  And I was broken and raw and wanted to quit.
*  And it was then I really began to realize this connection that, you know, I had been telling
*  these stories about people and the human condition, but at the backdrop of every single one of them
*  was always the natural world.
*  And that was my profound awakening, I think, when I began to understand that in every single
*  example, well, not every example, but in many of them, it was scarcity of basic resources,
*  like water and others, a changing climate and loss of fertile lands.
*  But almost always, it is the demands placed on our ecosystem that drives conflict and
*  human suffering.
*  And I think that that was my big shift and understanding that it was important to talk
*  about the conflicts, but it was equally as important to talk about what we're doing to
*  this planet, because you can, I mean, just in this last year alone, how many more conflicts
*  have started around the world?
*  How many more coups?
*  And I think in Africa, just this year, maybe the last six months, is it six or seven more
*  coups?
*  And I mean, Tyler, you know this better than I, but I see it.
*  And I think to not acknowledge that connection is ignorant.
*  We need to start paying attention to that.
*  And I think we're going to see so many more conflicts if we do not pay attention and to
*  focus on what do we do?
*  It's not enough as a journalist.
*  That was something else that made me deeply uncomfortable, which is I was asked to focus
*  on the violence, show just one piece of the story, and never was I asked to tell the stories
*  that acknowledge like, where we go, what do we do, where are the solutions, are there
*  solutions?
*  I know there's no easy balm and no solution for so many of these problems.
*  But the truth is, in every story I've covered, there are amazing people who are working to
*  try to find answers, but we don't highlight their work.
*  And I think as journalists, we have to do a better job of not just talking about the
*  challenges we face, but like, where do we go from here?
*  What do we do?
*  And there are people in every single story that we need to focus on their stories as
*  well.
*  What was it you did in year nine to keep yourself from going crazy from the stress,
*  the destruction, the sorrow?
*  So you did this for 10 years, right?
*  You enter year nine.
*  It must be very tough.
*  Well, in year nine, no, I was broken.
*  And honestly, I didn't know what to do in year nine.
*  It was either, I mean, I was very depressed and didn't know whether I would carry on.
*  And many times I thought about quitting.
*  And it was actually in those examples in year nine, I realized that I had examples when
*  I realized the power of what we do that stopped me from quitting.
*  I realized it was in those moments when you want to quit that you never give up.
*  Because what we do is actually very powerful.
*  And I had examples of seeing, you know, the fact that I always chose to go to tell stories
*  that not a lot of journalists were covering.
*  And I realized that sometimes it was getting those images back into the international,
*  you know, dialogue.
*  It was important.
*  And that's when I needed to stay.
*  But I think in year nine, you didn't want to know me.
*  I was really depressed and not in a good place.
*  And then I think year 10, I realized that's when I really understood that, one,
*  I needed to take a break and step away from covering the horrors of the world
*  because I was not able to think clearly.
*  And I think that actually that is how so many of my colleagues end up getting killed.
*  Because you don't know when to stop and take a break.
*  Because you need to be 100% present and clear about what's happening in front of you.
*  And I think if you're so broken, you can't do that.
*  And so in year 10, I took a break.
*  And in that break, a conservation organization approached me and asked me to do work
*  talking about forests and how important they are.
*  And that's also when I began my story on the Northern White Rhinos.
*  That was the moment I began to understand that connection to the natural world.
*  And that I needed to also tell the stories about the natural world
*  and how connected they are to all of these conflicts.
*  I believe you started your career photographing business people.
*  Was that fun?
*  No, I did not enjoy it at all.
*  But I did enjoy, I moved to the Czech Republic in a very exciting moment in their history.
*  I went and did a study abroad in 1990.
*  And then ended up in the Czech Republic in 1991.
*  And that was a tremendously exciting time to be there.
*  I knew I wanted to go back.
*  And so in 1997, I returned to go and work for a small business newspaper.
*  And I got to meet really interesting people.
*  Vaclav Havel.
*  And there was this moment right after the wall had come down.
*  It was this moment of so much hope.
*  And it was exciting, very exciting to be there.
*  And that quickly shifted to quitting my job and covering the war in the Balkans in 1997.
*  Nine months later, I was there as conflict was unfolding.
*  And ended up quitting that job and becoming a war photographer
*  without really knowing what I was doing.
*  But I just something inside of me knew I had to go.
*  Some questions about photography.
*  What is lost with the switch from film to digital?
*  Well, it's funny.
*  I think a lot of people lament the loss of film.
*  But I tell you, when I began my career, the reality is I was carrying film, chemicals,
*  a blow dryer to dry the, you know, the roll of film that was hanging in my hotel room,
*  a scanner, a huge scanner.
*  And then I was up all night trying to transmit one to two images per night from
*  working in these remote places.
*  So I don't lament the loss, to be honest, because right now digital has transformed our world.
*  We can go into the world and, you know, bring back these really important news stories
*  from the field, transmit them faster than we ever have.
*  And I mean, there's a whole other list of issues we have to talk about with AI.
*  But to me, I think, you know, honestly, it's probably better for the environment.
*  I think about all the chemicals we dumped into the planet.
*  And yeah, there is a loss of like that beautiful texture in the, you know, every image was unique.
*  But I think that there's no time in human history where, as creatives, we can create
*  anything we want.
*  And we can, you know, from a creative perspective, we can still create unique images and create
*  anything we imagine.
*  At the same time, then I, as a journalist with my journalist hat, I worry about authenticity.
*  And what are we going to do to make sure we have ways of identifying when images are
*  authentic and have not been manipulated?
*  And I think that both camera companies and the companies like Adobe, who do post-processing
*  manipulation, are working to be able to figure out how we can create these stamps on the
*  images to know they're authentic.
*  But I think we're in troubling times right now.
*  And, you know, taking your question into a totally different space.
*  I mean, I worry more about AI and what it's doing to the trust of, you know, how do we
*  know what's real and misinformation?
*  We're entering new waters right now that are terrifying.
*  So I think more about that than I think about the loss of film.
*  As you know, there's now social networks everywhere for quite a while, images everywhere,
*  even before mid-journey.
*  There are so many images that people are looking at.
*  How does that change how you compose or think about photos?
*  Well, it doesn't at all.
*  I mean, my job is to tell stories with images and not just with images.
*  I mean, my job is a storyteller.
*  That has not changed.
*  And nothing has changed in the sense of I think we need more great storytellers,
*  visual storytellers.
*  With all of those social media, I think people are bored with just beautiful images or,
*  you know, like sometimes it feels like advertising and it doesn't it doesn't captivate me.
*  I look for story and image and I am just going to continue doing what I do because
*  I think people are hungry for it.
*  They want to know who, you know, is really going deep on stories and who they can trust.
*  And I think that that has never gone away and it will never go away.
*  So I actually enjoy having social media because I think it's allowed me to connect with people
*  in a really real way that I never could have connected with.
*  There was always the media that we worked for and I could never connect with people.
*  And now I have this one-to-one connection and people, it is individuals who have empowered me
*  sometimes to go and continue telling the stories that I tell today.
*  I think that you just have to be adaptable in today's world and keep adapting to this changing,
*  you know, the changing landscapes that we're dealing with.
*  I always think about stories.
*  How do we tell the stories in a really deep, meaningful way?
*  I think visual images, by the way, have never had more reach and power than they do today.
*  And I love, I will, you know, always love the power of what we do because I think that we can
*  reach people both, you know, intellectually but also with our hearts.
*  And that is really important.
*  What would be an example of a photo by others that truly has mattered to you?
*  Oh, gosh. I mean, my first example is Steve Winter's image of P22, which is a leopard
*  that he photographed below the Hollywood sign. And this story is so incredible.
*  He dreamed of this image 10 years before he even took it.
*  He talked to the scientists all working in this landscape, and they said, Steve, there's no
*  leopard, I mean, there's no cougars in this landscape. You know, you can dream it, but
*  there's no cougars there. And he said, you know, I'm just going to try. And he set up camera traps
*  for over a year underneath the Hollywood sign and dreamt it, dreamt this image. And sure enough,
*  he was right. There were cougars in this landscape. And the problem is that they were separated from
*  habitat across 10 lanes of traffic. And his one image is what actually was the catalyst to create
*  the world's largest wildlife overpass. So for people that don't think images can change
*  the world or help and be a catalyst for positive changes, let me point you to Steve Winter's image.
*  It is memorable. You can't forget it once you've looked at it. And it's also, I think a lot of
*  these images push all of us as photographers to become advocates. Steve has set up a great
*  nonprofit that advocates for big cats around the world and the struggles they face. And I think for
*  a lot of us, you know, the truth is as photographers, we are usually introverts, we're usually shy,
*  we like being behind the camera. I don't enjoy being in the public eye. But once you take these
*  powerful images, you realize you these images and the stories give us voice and we have to go and
*  then advocate for what we see. And so yeah, that's one story. And there's so many more.
*  Steve The famous photo of the green eyed girl from Afghanistan. What do you think of it?
*  Jennifer Well, you know, I think now we're hearing stories about, you know,
*  the truth of that image. And the woman, she's now an adult, that she was a girl that was photographed.
*  And I think it's an important lesson for photographers, especially when we're going
*  and photographing out of our own communities, out of our own cultures, to tread lightly,
*  to understand where you are. And so photography can be very powerful and give voice and amplify
*  people's stories. It can also be tremendously exploitative and colonial and all of these
*  horrific things come with photography. And so, you know, I think that I really pay attention.
*  And, and it doesn't matter where you are, but you need to take the time to first get the blessings
*  of the people you're photographing, let them understand why you're there, what you're doing,
*  and to be sensitive. And I think that is an example of it. Like maybe this is a wonderful
*  photographer who took all these pictures that are iconic. But in this case, we're hearing now
*  the stories that it was traumatic for the girl that was photographed. And I think it's really
*  important to understand that for anybody with a camera, that it is, it can be a weapon in many
*  ways and can be, it can be really exploitative. And a lot of cultures believe that photography
*  takes a piece of their soul. And even the San Bruro, the community I work in, they also say
*  that like, you know, photography can take a piece of our soul. And so when I'm working in places,
*  I pay attention to these stories of the photographers that went before me. And I make sure that,
*  that people really want me there. I need to know I have their permission. And I think that is
*  something all of us need to really reflect on and pay attention to.
*  Susan Sontag once wrote about photography, and I quote,
*  it is mainly a social right, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power, unquote. Do you
*  agree or not? Absolutely. Absolutely. And I also ask myself every time I'm taking a picture,
*  what gives me the right to be taking this picture? And I also believe it is important to ask, you
*  know, this question, who gets to take the picture is very important. I work a lot right now to try
*  to bring cameras to the communities that I spend a lot of time working in so they can own their
*  stories as well. You know, it's not that I think it is wrong for outsiders to take pictures and
*  tell stories. I think first of all, you need to make sure you have permission to be there.
*  I think it's important to have a multitude of viewpoints. Sometimes outsiders can give great
*  perspective to a story, but you need to have the permission, the blessings of the community first
*  and foremost. And then I also ask, like, well, you know, in today's world, with all of these
*  platforms and ways of sharing stories, why shouldn't the people whose stories you're telling
*  be able to tell their own stories? And I'm trying to do everything I can with my nonprofit
*  to give the tools and give access. I mean, I think that we need to hear the stories from everybody
*  because the only way we're going to become, you know, create a more equitable world and get to a
*  more balanced world is by having that multitude of voices and people sharing their own stories.
*  Can National Geographic still have a major cultural footprint in a world with Instagram
*  and other images?
*  Is the question, do they?
*  Can they? Do they?
*  Oh, I think they do. I mean, how many followers do they have? They do. And they need to
*  really be careful with that. I mean, it's a great responsibility, too, with that great power of
*  reaching so many people. I think they're an organization in great transition. They've been
*  bought by Disney. They need to really pay attention to where they're going. I think they are trying to.
*  I think it's important to differentiate between National Geographic society and National Geographic,
*  which one is a nonprofit leg of it and one is a for-profit side. And I think that you will see
*  slightly different missions and work coming out of both sides of that institution.
*  Now, you've traveled to over 100 countries, as I have also, actually. And I've met quite a few
*  people who've done that. And so many of them, they insist to me that all they really want to do is
*  relax. And I never believe them. At the margin, what is it now you want to see more of?
*  Hmm. Well, I don't want to relax. If you're not
*  feeling anxious about the state of the world right now, I think you have your head in the sand.
*  And in some ways, I can understand wanting to put your head in the sand, because it's hard
*  understanding what's happening. I want to stay engaged. I think that there has never been a need
*  to be engaged in the world. And I think walk towards the things that scare you. Embrace them.
*  Embrace fear. Walk towards communities and people that you don't understand. I think, Tyler, you may
*  know this as somebody who's had the privilege of traveling as much as you have, that we need more
*  understanding, truly listening to each other and understanding of the people and the things that
*  are different than what we know. And so I do not want to relax right now. I want to empower others
*  to share their own stories. And I don't need to travel as much anymore. I actually think that I
*  can do a lot of work right here from home. And maybe my imprint on the world can be by
*  supporting others to tell those stories. But yeah, I one day want to interview you. Is that
*  possible? Because absolutely. Anytime. All right. May I ask you, may I reverse that question and ask
*  you, how do you feel? You mean about relaxing? I don't ever want to relax. I would prefer to die
*  with my boots on, as they say. And maybe at some point my health will force my hand. But until then,
*  I say full steam ahead. Absolutely. Love it. Yes. But let's say you had two free weeks gifted to you.
*  Doesn't interrupt your work responsibilities and a private plane, green efficient, whatever. It will
*  bring you where you want for two weeks. Where do you pick? Well, I let the stories guide me. So it
*  depends what would be happening, where my work would be of greatest value. And I think it's
*  usually the long-term stories. So I tell stories over time. I think stories need time to evolve.
*  And it's probably going to be back in Northern Kenya. I think that we will see a Northern white
*  rhino baby in our lifetime. And I suspect it will be to get back there quickly, to witness the birth
*  of a Northern white rhino baby. That's my great hope. Wonderful. Great. Who first spotted your
*  talent and how did they see it? That would be my professor, Rich Beckman, who not only spotted it,
*  but cultivated it, nurtured it, has been my guide for now 35 years or more. And, oh, more. Oh,
*  that's frightening. And really helped me see the opportunities for somebody that I couldn't get a
*  job in the beginning because I wasn't a proven talent. That would be him. And then there's so
*  many people along the way who have trusted me, given me access to stories. Yeah, there's a lot
*  of names there, Tyler. If you couldn't get a job at first, how is it you were hired? How did that
*  happen? Oh, it was because it was in the world of that shift from film to digital, where I could
*  then send in pictures. And very often people thought I was a man. And so in the beginning,
*  I was able to do the work that I do because people didn't really know that I was a woman.
*  I would always get letters back, dear sir. And I think, you know, in the beginning, a lot of people
*  told me I didn't belong there. I shouldn't be there. And I'm so proud that we've made a great
*  change in the last 20 years. We still have a ton of work to do. But I think that in today's world,
*  there's probably more female photographers and journalists out there graduating from schools
*  than there are men. And I'm glad about that because I think that it changes the way the world
*  looks. But I think we need to work harder to create more, to make it more equitable for,
*  you know, a lot more diversity coming out of journalism school right now.
*  Now, you must meet plenty of young photographers. Obviously, you look at their photographs.
*  But when you meet them, think about them. What are the non-obvious qualities you look for,
*  for who could be important? Obviously, they should have a good work ethic, but what would be
*  not obvious? What gets you excited? Oh, I mean, ethics and empathy. And sometimes it's the really
*  shy people that may not have a lot of self-confidence. And I recognize who I was when I started and
*  realized that we all have great capacity within ourselves. And I was written off in the beginning
*  because I was so shy and people didn't think I had what it took. And actually, those are the people
*  that I want in the field, the sensitive souls, the people that are, you know, not thinking it's
*  about them. They don't have large egos. I actually want them out in the world telling the stories.
*  And I am the underdog. I'm always getting behind the underdogs in the world.
*  I sometimes say that introverts make the best extroverts. But how did you move from being so shy
*  by your own account to now what at least superficially seems to be not shy at all?
*  I think it was being allowed to tell the stories and then realizing that people wanted to hear
*  the story. So I think I didn't really get a strong voice until very recently when I was asked to
*  become a speaker. And I think that the first few talks that I gave were terrible, but then
*  with a little bit of confidence and realizing the beauty in these stories and the power of sharing
*  them, that it could inspire so many other people to remember that it was never about me,
*  that I'm just the messenger, that gave me great confidence. And I think it was actually that part
*  of when I was being forced to get on stage and get in front of the camera that that's where I
*  really got my confidence. Final question. What is it you will do next? Oh, well, I have many projects,
*  but we're launching our next campaign to support getting elephants that were orphaned back into
*  the wild. So I'm launching that. I have a film also that's going to be opening at the American
*  Museum of Natural History in New York as part of their elephant exhibition. And so next work is
*  all around elephants and of course the Northern White Rhino. I keep going back for that.
