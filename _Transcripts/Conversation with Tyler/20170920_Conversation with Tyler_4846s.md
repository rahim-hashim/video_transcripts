# Larry  Summers on Macroeconomics, Mentorship, and Avoiding Complacency  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [September 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpsrdr3B7L0)
*  I'm here with Larry Summers.
*  Of course, Larry has many notable achievements.
*  But for me personally, the most important one is that of all the classes I took at Harvard
*  University, he taught the very best one, and that was PhD Macra I.
*  So I'd like to start with a question about education and this idea of mentoring.
*  In your career, you've mentored a large number of very successful people.
*  Alan Krueger from my class, Ed Balls, Sheryl Sandberg, Natasha Siren, who's here with us
*  today.
*  What is your philosophy of mentoring?
*  How do you think about this analytically, and what can the rest of us learn from this?
*  So I should say first, Tyler, since you were kind enough to compliment my class, that when
*  my wife heard that I was doing this interview with you, she thought it was really exciting
*  because you had written the only economics book that she had ever enjoyed reading.
*  That book being about where and how to find good food.
*  So she really, working in the White House, that was fine.
*  But being interviewed by Tyler Cowen, that meant I had really arrived.
*  Thank you.
*  I don't really think of it as mentoring.
*  I think of it as finding people who are as talented as I can to work with, and then trying
*  to make sure that it's something that works for both people.
*  And so each of the people you've mentioned, I've got an enormous amount out of the working
*  relationship as we collaborated on various kinds of projects.
*  I tried to give back as well by helping people advance in their careers.
*  In each of the cases you described, I formed friendships that have lasted for a long time.
*  So I thought of it as something that was very much, I didn't think of it as some huge act
*  of generosity on my part, very much the contrary.
*  Getting to work with Sheryl Sandberg, I was a much better Treasury Secretary because I
*  had Sheryl Sandberg as the Chief of Staff.
*  Something similar is true of each of the people I've worked with.
*  I think my experience working with people is that if you pick able people and you make
*  clear that you think very highly of their talents, they will welcome it if you tell
*  them the truth about what they've done better and what they have done worse.
*  And so I've had a relatively direct approach with the people who I've worked with and I've
*  encouraged them to have a very direct approach with me.
*  That's tended to work out for both of us.
*  Who is innovating in higher education right now and what are they learning from this innovation?
*  Not enough people are innovating enough in higher education.
*  The place to start is General Electric looks nothing like it looked in 1975.
*  Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Stanford look a lot like they looked in 1975.
*  They're about the same size to within a factor of two.
*  They're about the same number of buildings.
*  They operate on about the same calendar.
*  They have many of the same people or some number of the same people in significant positions.
*  So I think the main thing to say is that for something that's all about ideas and for something
*  that's all about young people, the pace of innovation in higher education is stunningly
*  slow.
*  We're still on a system where the break is in the summer.
*  And the reason we're on that system is that when everybody went to pick the plants, that
*  was the natural way to organize school and it's still going that way.
*  I think the action in the potential action in higher education is probably heavily through
*  distance learning and artificial intelligence and learning technologies of various kinds.
*  it, the unique capacity that online education has is that on the one hand, they're huge
*  economies of scale.
*  Once the lectures film, the 100,000 people can watch it at the same cost as 100 people
*  watching it.
*  And on the other hand, you can have much more personalization.
*  You can re-listen to the bit you didn't understand.
*  You can insert diagnostic questions and have a different lecture for people depending on
*  how they do on the diagnostic questions.
*  So it permits what's usually very rare, which is more differentiation and more economies
*  of scale.
*  But I would say to date, it hasn't yet been pursued on a scale and with a degree of energy
*  that is commensurate with the real challenge.
*  A number of universities have made what Clay Christensen would say is the first elementary
*  error.
*  They said that their MOOC efforts or their distance learning efforts are going to all
*  be designed to be complementary of better education on their campuses.
*  Well that's, there's certain logic to that in terms of faculty politics and in terms
*  of faculty comfort and all of that.
*  But the essence of Clay Christensen's lessons about disruptive innovation is if you want
*  to do something all new, you have to separate it from the original mission, not judge it
*  by the standards of the original product and let it be separate.
*  And what I've been struck by in the distance education efforts is that they tend to be
*  very much within paradigm and not set up in separate ways.
*  So I think the main thing to say about innovation in higher education is that there's much
*  too little of it.
*  Regular economics.
*  One hears increasingly these days that the higher concentration ratios in the American
*  economy are an economically relevant fact.
*  We all know those ratios are up somewhat.
*  But at the same time, consumers don't in an obvious way seem to feel the burden of monopoly
*  if you just look at product choice and variety.
*  Productivity may be slow.
*  The growth of manufacturing output appears to be quite steady.
*  There's not obviously a break in that series where all the monopolies restrict output.
*  So we have all these different pieces of data, high share values, high measured profits,
*  very steady output behavior, a lot of product variety.
*  How do you think about the issue of monopoly in the American economy right now?
*  Is it significant or not?
*  I'm not most things I might be right or wrong, but I'm confident.
*  This is one where I'm not I'm not certain.
*  On the one hand, Tyler, higher concentration ratios, higher profit with lower investment
*  manifest in lower interest rates.
*  More monopoly power sort of fits the story.
*  Right.
*  On the other hand, take a thing like Apple Pay.
*  Apple Pay means that Apple, which is already the largest company in America, is even larger.
*  And so you could say that's kind of more monopoly and more market power.
*  Or you could say there's a whole financial industry that's now getting competed with
*  from outside the financial industry.
*  And so it's making things more competitive.
*  Both those views have merit.
*  I kind of think the second may have more merit than the first.
*  So some of the rhetoric one hears recently, which kind of leave you with the impression
*  that we're seeing an era of a lot of new standard oils, seems to me to be quite overdone
*  with respect to the facts as I understand them.
*  On the other hand, are there combinations of health care systems in cities where we
*  go from having some real competition to there being one dominant provider and clearly the
*  problems, the benefits, I think there's almost certainly a almost certainly some problems
*  there.
*  Are there difficult issues when information is central, as it would be with a Facebook
*  or a Google?
*  Yes, there are difficult issues, privacy, reliance on information, networks.
*  But are those best thought of through the prism of antitrust and monopoly?
*  I'm not at all sure that that is the best way to think about them.
*  After all, in some sense the products in those two examples are given away to consumers
*  for free.
*  I think one of the most important issues for economists to figure out over the next couple
*  of years is how to think about these trends.
*  I think there are some selective grounds for concern.
*  I think it's much more likely that antitrust has been insufficiently tough than it is that
*  it's been too tough over the last decade.
*  But I also think one needs to be careful about the fact that being a successful business
*  will tend to cause you to have more profits.
*  And we usually think of that as a good thing, not a bad thing.
*  Here's a real softball question.
*  What's the optimal rate of tax on capital income?
*  Closer to the tax rate on other income than to zero.
*  That would be my answer to that.
*  A fair amount of capital income reflects rents of one kind or another.
*  Capital income is substantially held by those at the high end.
*  There's a fair amount of what's really capital income in the form of unrealized capital gains
*  that never gets taxed.
*  I think the right aggregate capital income tax rate is closer to what would go with a
*  comprehensive income tax than it is to the alternative idea that capital income taxation
*  is just a way of taxing future consumption.
*  And therefore you should tax future consumption and present consumption at the same rate and
*  the tax rate should be zero.
*  If we think about the 1980s, there are a lot of models from that time, some coming from
*  your research, where you have an infinite horizon model with a zero tax rate on capital
*  income.
*  At some point enough capital accumulates so that even wages are higher and there's a kind
*  of steady state long run argument that still the number should be zero.
*  What has changed that makes those models less applicable?
*  Is it that we think that elasticity is different or is it some other variable?
*  What's changed in our knowledge or your understanding?
*  At the technical level there's been some mathematical work showing that some of the results that
*  you're referring to from the 1980s were just mathematically wrong.
*  That's one part.
*  I think the second and more consequential part is that the premise of those models was
*  essentially that the supply of capital was infinitely elastic.
*  And so you would, whatever the tax rate, you would drive capital to the point where the
*  after tax rate of return was some fixed number.
*  And that just now looks like a very poor description of reality.
*  We've seen real interest rates fluctuate substantially and we just don't see that when real interest
*  rates are higher, savings is lots higher and when real interest rates are lower, savings
*  is lots lower in the way that many people, including me in the early 1980s, would have
*  expected.
*  And so in the absence of that kind of evidence, I think the argument is very much attenuated.
*  What if someone said, well, for the special 20 year period we lived through Bernanke's
*  East Asian savings class.
*  So there was always enough capital.
*  Real rates were very low.
*  Arguably for demographic reasons that's starting to end and we'll end up back in an era where
*  actually the supply of capital with respect to the rate of return will be high again.
*  Is that possible, unlikely, too far away to matter?
*  First, one word one should never use in economics is never.
*  So I don't want to preclude any possibility completely.
*  And you uncharacteristically made an analytic conflation there.
*  You conflated the idea that the savings rate would fall for a variety of reasons with the
*  idea that the savings rate would become more elastic, which is a separate issue.
*  I don't see any reason to think the savings rate will become more elastic.
*  And with respect to the savings rate falling, my reading of the evidence would be different.
*  I think that the structural factors driving low interest rates, including longer life
*  expectancy, which makes people save more increased insecurity, more inequality, are more likely
*  to be semi permanent than they are to prove transient.
*  And I think a variety of the factors holding down investment, the demographic factor, the
*  fact that you can buy an enormous amount of capital for a very low cost, think about my
*  iPhone, all of that I think operates in the direction of meaning that we're likely to
*  have this phenomenon of low real interest rates and secular stagnation for quite a long
*  time to come.
*  Let's say you're advising a philanthropist in St. Louis and that person has $100 million
*  to help the city.
*  For general background, there are poor public schools, a fair amount of crime, a lot of
*  racial segregation, but some good universities, hospitals, it's a biotech hub.
*  What kind of advice would you give?
*  How should they start thinking about this problem?
*  Wait, let me see.
*  You're asking me about a philanthropist I've never met.
*  In a city in which I've spent a day and a half that has relatively generic urban problems.
*  What should the philanthropist do?
*  Or the poorer parts of Boston, if you prefer.
*  That's the question.
*  I was kind of trying to temporize a bit, but that's the question.
*  So look, I would tell the philanthropist a few general things.
*  One is, I would say, your temptation is going to be to spread the butter uniformly across
*  the bread and to try to do everything.
*  And that your $100 million is a lot of money, but the budget of the city of St. Louis is
*  measured in the low billions of dollars.
*  And so you can't do everything.
*  And if you try to do a little bit of everything, you won't see anything you did.
*  So you should look for a targeted couple of interventions that will be most effective.
*  That's the first thing I'd say.
*  Second thing I'd say is, you need to be very careful to make sure that whatever you think
*  you're buying is what you're actually buying.
*  That if you give more money to the health budget of the city, and the city responds
*  by reallocating its own money from healthcare to other things, then you'll have demonstrated
*  fungibility, you won't have spurred healthcare.
*  So have a strategy for addressing fungibility.
*  I would probably say that if you can do something meaningful in education to create positive
*  examples in education, which can then be emulated.
*  And this is K-3 Crowell.
*  Yeah, that's likely to be the most effective thing that you can do.
*  But you need to be very careful not to succeed by cannibalization.
*  That many, too many philanthropists interested in education decide they're going to set
*  up a charter school, only their charter school is only going to admit highly motivated kids
*  with highly motivated parents, and their charter school is going to pay 20% more than
*  the regular schools and cherry pick the best teachers out of the regular schools, and then
*  they're going to be really thrilled about how they have better achievement than the
*  regular public schools when it's clear from the nature of their model, selecting the kids
*  and cherry picking the teachers, that it is supremely nonreplicable.
*  So I would say, impose a replicability constraint on yourself and innovate in the area of education.
*  My general view has been that a lot of the way successful innovation happens is alongside
*  big systems.
*  So I don't know whether it's preschool before kindergarten.
*  I don't know whether it's summer programs.
*  I've been active in Boston with citizen schools, an organization that does after school programs.
*  But I probably as a vehicle for getting an education, look at something that wasn't
*  either joining the public schools or going to war with the public schools, but was acting
*  constructively alongside the public schools in the after school or preschool or transition
*  from high school or summer school or some such would probably be the advice I'd give.
*  Now there may be a few people in the audience who don't know, you've actually delivered
*  a lecture at University of Chicago Law School on the Herman Melville short story, Paradise
*  of Bachelors, Tartarus of Maids.
*  What did you learn from engaging with that story with respect to social change or segregation
*  or gender issues?
*  Anything from that story as you read it as an economist and social scientist?
*  Well the first thing I learned was that I should probably stick to my day job of economics
*  because while I typically find myself reasonably cogent relative to others in discussing economic
*  issues, attending that literary conference, I did not find myself relatively cogent relative
*  to other literary, relative to other literary experts.
*  And I'm not sure I would have made it through that experience without the help of my wife
*  who is a professor of English at Harvard.
*  I guess what I took, what I learned from that was that literature had a way of evoking the
*  non-pecuniary, what an economist would call the non-pecuniary aspects of work that is
*  sort of lacking when you say non-pecuniary aspects of work and you write a mathematical
*  function, utility of consumption, leisure, and job attributes. And that there was a kind
*  of texture of alienation and depersonalization that was provided by Melville that one missed
*  if one thought about things in the economic paradigm is what I learned.
*  Now speaking of work, your last op-ed was on labor unions and you suggested a hope for
*  a future where labor unions are stronger. Let me tell you my worry and see if you can
*  talk me out of it. If I look at the labor economics literature, it seems to me the union
*  wage premium is declining. It used to be about 15 percent, now maybe it's seven or eight
*  percent. Some studies find it's zero. And if you say it's seven or eight percent, if
*  you take the seven or eight percent, a lot of that's a tax on capital but surely some
*  of it turns up in the form of higher prices so labor gives back some of it. Surely some
*  of it turns up in the form of lower demand for labor so some people don't get that jobs.
*  So if I think of unions being much stronger, even without worrying about allocative efficiency
*  costs, I just see this one time bump upwards of like maybe three, four percent which would
*  be a gain but wouldn't change the fundamental reality on the ground. Now can you talk me
*  into more optimism on this or do you just think well three or four percent is a lot,
*  let's do it?
*  Three or four percent is pretty large relative to real wage growth that's taken place over
*  the last generation is the first thing I'd say. Second thing I'd say is that as I learned
*  reading Melville, there are important non-pecuniary aspects of jobs. And if you look at turnover,
*  which is a kind of measure of job satisfaction, it's much lower in union employers. If you
*  look at the way in which employee grievances are dealt with, it is more, it is more, it
*  is more respectful of those potentially discriminated against in union workplaces. If you look at
*  job safety, it appears to be better in union workplaces. So I think looking at wages is
*  a good way to miss the local benefits of unions.
*  I think the third thing is that, and you know again this would depend on one's personal
*  and one's broad policy views, but that more successful unions push for policies like the
*  preservation of social security, the expansion of the healthcare safety net that are for
*  the benefit of everyone. And so the political impact of a society in which labor is better
*  organized on the broad contours of policy is another way in which stronger unions can
*  make a difference. But part of the argument of that piece was, I don't know what exactly
*  the right level of unionization is, and I don't know exactly what would be optimal,
*  but if we've got a system where if somebody tries to organize the workers in a company
*  and the company fires the attempted organizer, and the only remedy the organizer has is to
*  spend five years fighting through the courts where if they win, they'll get back salary
*  less whatever they earned in whatever new job they got. The cost benefit for the employer
*  has to be that it's incredibly attractive to fire the would-be organizer. So we don't
*  have a remotely level playing field where workers are given an opportunity to make whatever
*  choice they prefer, and that seems wrong to me. So I look at an America where corporate
*  profits rose last year, and I look at the United States, and I look at the United States
*  last year by 16 percent, and wages have been stagnant, and it seems to me that more bargaining
*  power for workers almost certainly has to be good, but I agree with you that the technological
*  dynamics, the globalization dynamics of a modern economy mean that it's not clear just
*  how large the benefits of more bargaining power will be, but it's like the question
*  of how much weight I should lose. I don't know how much weight I should lose, but I
*  kind of know which direction I should be moving, and that's kind of how I feel about more
*  labor power.
*  Now, in the middle of all of these conversations, we have an interlude where I ask the interviewees
*  about table tennis, and I understand that this summer you played in the table tennis
*  Jewish Olympics in Tel Aviv. Is that correct?
*  That is correct.
*  What mental qualities make for a good table tennis player?
*  Judging by my performance, qualities that I do not possess. I think a good question
*  is depth risk, a certain capacity for concentration, and a great deal of practice. While I practiced
*  intensely in the run-up to the activity, there were other participants who had been practicing
*  intensely for decades, and that gave them a substantial advantage. I also probably was
*  not the quickest participant in that competition, even in the 60 and over division, which was
*  the division in which I was participating, but I found it enormously satisfying to be
*  on an Olympic team, which is not something I ever thought about.
*  You heard about that, I suspect, because some magazine wrote a story about it, and the reporter
*  who wrote the story said to me, Mr. Summers, you used to be Treasury Secretary, whatever
*  you did at Harvard. How did it feel like putting a track suit on and running out with 800 other
*  Americans into a stadium? I said, well, 10-year-olds dream a lot more about international athletic
*  competition than they do about fiscal or monetary policy.
*  What is the rate of productivity improvement in table tennis amongst the very best players?
*  Someone like Jan Ove Waldner or Ding Ning, are they a lot better than the best players
*  of 20, 30 years ago, or just a little better?
*  I am struck in general by the fact that a good college track athlete is a very good
*  athlete, can now run a four-minute mile, and nobody in the world had ever run a four-minute
*  mile before 1954. That the world record in swimming events in 1964 wouldn't qualify
*  you for the NCAA championships in 2017. In the sports where we can measure things,
*  there's vast and rapid improvement, and huge improvement.
*  I'm not sure why people debate whether Shaq is better or worse than Will Chamberlain,
*  or whether people debate whether today's best baseball players compare with Willie Mays,
*  or whether they debate whether Rafael Nadal could beat Bill Tilton. My assumption is
*  that of course Rafael Nadal could beat Bill Tilton, even with the same equipment. I would
*  assume that the same thing is true in table tennis. Better learning about technique, better
*  training approaches, greater intensity, and better equipment, I assume mean that the quality
*  of play in all these things is much higher than it used to be. I think it's a mistake
*  that people generally make to acknowledge progress in the places where it can be readily
*  and concretely measured, and then be in doubt about whether there is progress in the spheres
*  where it can't be measured. I think the right first approximation is to think that there's
*  progress in all spheres. To take it to someplace that's outside of athletics where I've been
*  very struck, I think the evidence is overwhelming, at least very strong, in favor of the so-called
*  Flynn effect, which suggests that all over the world, if you administer any kind of constant
*  IQ test, averages in populations have been getting smarter for a long time. I think that's
*  probably right as well. Now we're here in Washington, D.C. I'm going to ask you some
*  kind of short bullet questions about the effect of the Flynn effect on the world. I think
*  the first question is about super current policy issues. Feel free to pass. You can
*  give just a sound bite answer, but if you want to go on, please do. Right now, on the
*  Fed, there are only three seats being held, and it seems if things go according to plan
*  by the beginning of 2019, everyone on that board will have been appointed by President
*  Trump. Now you've been a lifelong Democrat, so probably your dream candidates are not
*  to the Republicans that they possibly might listen to.
*  What would that advice be for filling these seats?
*  Serious, thoughtful people with real expertise who will set monetary policy based on a pragmatic
*  reading of data rather than a strong ideology or a political orientation.
*  The Dream Act is in the news right now.
*  What's the best way to think about where the limits to immigration should be?
*  So you've spoken out in favor of renewing the Dream Act or possibly doing more, but
*  what's the margin at which we say no more?
*  Look, I think on the Dream Act, because the people are here and they've invested their
*  lives and we as a country made a commitment to them, I think it's kind of a no-brainer
*  to find ways to enable them to stay.
*  I think the right broad deal on immigration is, yes, there should be immigration, but
*  at least my view is the idea of the melting pot, which has become kind of unfashionable
*  in many circles, is actually a good idea.
*  And the understanding should be that if you immigrate to the United States, you're immigrating
*  to the United States to become an American.
*  And that reflects a kind of acculturation, one crucial part of which is speaking English
*  and understanding that you're going to be learning English and that you're going to
*  be carrying on your life in English.
*  And I think if we had more acceptance of the idea that immigration was about becoming American,
*  we would have more acceptance of higher levels of immigration than generate comfort right
*  now.
*  But I think that one does need to understand that any country should make policy in the
*  interests of its current citizens.
*  I think it would be in the interests of America's current citizens to have more immigrants come
*  for all sorts of economic reasons and many ways in which it would support the economy.
*  But I think that when the argument is framed in terms of broad obligation to humanity and
*  so forth, it's understandable that there's some reluctance to accept that argument.
*  Today it was announced a three-month extension of the debt ceiling.
*  Virtually all economists think there should be no debt ceiling.
*  But that said, what's striking is Trump seems to be doing this with the Democrats.
*  Do you see a kind of shift in regime where Trump will try to govern as an independent
*  and possibly get nothing done?
*  Or do you think there will now be agreements with Democrats in Congress?
*  I'd be surprised if there was much where there could be agreements with Democrats.
*  I think the debt ceiling is in some ways more sui generis than it is a template for things
*  to come.
*  I'm going to sell all of my Ethereum and double down in VIX.
*  See you in hell.
*  If you were tweeting back to that person, Ethereum and ICO seem to be priced very high.
*  VIX seems to be remarkably low for what at least two observers feels like a very volatile
*  period in our history, either nationally or globally.
*  How do you think about those asset prices?
*  I don't know from where Ethereum is going.
*  It makes me nervous whenever I see an asset where I think most of the demanders are buying
*  it in the anticipation of selling it to somebody else at a higher price rather than buying
*  it in the anticipation of some use they'll put it to or some set of cash flows they'll
*  receive.
*  I tend to be nervous about cyber currencies.
*  I think in particular some of the more libertarian arguments that are made in their favor, governments
*  are going to debauch the regular currencies or this will permit avoidance of excruciating
*  regulation and the like.
*  I'd be pretty skeptical of.
*  That said, I think blockchains are fundamental technology.
*  There will be winners that come out of its use.
*  Which cryptocurrency it will be, I don't know, but some of what's said makes me uneasy.
*  With respect to the VIX, first of all, it was up 30% yesterday, so whatever anomaly
*  one saw is a lot less anomalous today.
*  Second, the VIX, people tend to underappreciate this.
*  The volatility of the market moves very much with the level of the market.
*  The reason is that if a company has $100 of debt and $100 of equity and then the stock
*  market goes up, it's sort of 50-50 levered.
*  But if the stock market goes up by $100, then it has $100 of debt and $200 of equity and
*  it's only one-third levered.
*  So when the stock market goes up, its volatility naturally goes down and the stock market has
*  gone way up over the last 10 months.
*  And that's a factor operating to make its volatility go significantly down.
*  It's also the case if you look at surprises, the magnitude of errors in the consensus estimates
*  of company profits or the consensus estimates of industrial production or what have you,
*  numbers have been coming in close to consensus to an unusual degree over the last few months.
*  I think all those things contribute to the relatively low level of the VIX.
*  But those are more in the way of post-explanations.
*  If you had told me everything that was going on in the world and asked me to guess where
*  the VIX would be, I would expect it to have been a little higher than it is right now.
*  Today Dennis Rodman offered to mediate between President Donald Trump and the leader of North
*  Korea Kim Jong-un.
*  Now you wouldn't sell yourself as an expert on North Korea, but as an economist, people
*  who've negotiated with the North Koreans swear they're rational.
*  Is your instinct to apply a rational actor model to try to understand what's going on
*  there, or do you think it's more like a version of behavioral economics where other ends are
*  being pursued?
*  I don't think I can answer that.
*  I think what I'd say is my instinct is the rational actor model is probably right.
*  But that means I'm 80% sure that that's right.
*  And the consequence of getting it wrong could really be huge.
*  And so I sure want to pursue the rational actor model in a way that's doing a lot of
*  hedging against a set of possibilities that there are behavioral aspects.
*  Okay.
*  It seems the Fed keeps on...
*  That answer seemed a little evasive.
*  No, no, no.
*  It was.
*  It was.
*  The Fed seems to consistently come in under 2% for inflation.
*  Do you think this is just a systematic mistake?
*  You think it's a plan motivated by political economy concerns?
*  That there's a high political cost to being above 2, but a much lower cost to being below
*  2?
*  Do you think the implications of the semi-liquidity trap have not been fully digested yet?
*  Do you think it's a lag from an earlier error still percolating through the system?
*  How do you think about the failure to meet 2%?
*  In an environment where, of course, it seems if we had inflation being a bit higher, it
*  would not be a major cost.
*  I think the Fed has not fully grasped the reality of secular stagnation.
*  The reality of secular stagnation is that we've got a very high savings propensity
*  and a very low investment propensity.
*  And that means that the neutral real interest rate, the real interest rate that's consistent
*  with full employment, is very low.
*  And that means that interest rates, which would historically have been highly expansionary
*  interest rates, are not highly expansionary.
*  And the Fed has underestimated the extent to which that's true.
*  And therefore, they've been disappointed by how little inflation they've generated.
*  I think that's the primary explanation, a sort of analytical misjudgment on their part
*  of the change in the neutral interest rate.
*  I think secondarily, the factors we were referring to a few moments ago having to do with the
*  reductions in workers' leverage and bargaining power means that a degree of tightness in
*  labor markets that would in an earlier point have set off a wage spiral, no longer sets
*  off a wage spiral because of how nervous workers are.
*  And so the Phillips curve relationship has either broken down or shifted, and that the
*  Fed has also underestimated that.
*  And then I think, like those are two aspects, then separate from those two aspects, I think
*  the Fed is confused in what it's prepared to target.
*  It says that it has a 2% inflation target.
*  But if you have a 2% inflation target, and it is, as the Fed claims, symmetric, that
*  means you should be above 2% as often as you've been below 2%.
*  Well, we've been below 2% for nine years now, and we're in the ninth year of an economic
*  recovery, and the unemployment rate is at 4.3%.
*  So if there was ever a time when you were going to be above 2%, it would seem like now,
*  assuming recovery continues for several more years, would be that time.
*  And yet, not a single dot in the history of the FOMC has ever been above 2%, at least
*  since the great financial crisis.
*  So I think there's a disconnect between what they're prepared to forecast and what they
*  say is the nature of the 2% target.
*  If my instincts would be to be more genuinely symmetric about the 2% and more recognizing
*  the current policy is not quite as expansionary as they suppose, both of which would operate
*  in the direction of caution with respect to monetary tightening.
*  If there's an ongoing demand shortfall, as is suggested by many secular stagnation approaches,
*  does that mean monopoly cannot be a major economic problem, because that's from the
*  supply side, and that the supply side constraint isn't really binding?
*  If you think of there as being multiple Lagrangians, forgive me for getting technical for a moment,
*  but do you see what I'm saying?
*  That wouldn't have been the way I'd have thought about it, Tyler, but that might be.
*  But what you're saying might be right.
*  I think I'd be inclined to say that if there's more monopoly, there's more money going to
*  monopoly firms where there's a low propensity to spend it, both because the firms don't
*  invest and because the owners of the firms tend to be rich or endowments that have a
*  low propensity to spend.
*  And so the greater monopoly power, to the extent that it exists, is one factor operating
*  to raise savings and reduce investment, which contributes to demand shortfalls and secular stagnation.
*  I also think that there's likely to be less entry in competition in markets that aren't
*  growing rapidly than there is in markets that are growing rapidly, so there's a sense in
*  which less demand over time creates its own lack of supply.
*  Let me ask you a deliberately too naive question, and that is, don't wealthy people invest almost
*  all of their money, and thus why is that an aggregate demand shortfall?
*  Wealthy people don't put it all under their mattress.
*  They put it all in financial assets of one kind or another, but when they put it all
*  in financial assets of one kind or another, they drive up the prices of those financial
*  assets, which is driving down the return on those assets, which is driving down the natural
*  or neutral level of interest rates.
*  But in a Q theory framework, won't that increase investment if the price of the stock
*  market goes up?
*  It operates in the direction of raising investment, but if there are limits on how far interest
*  rates can fall, because safe interest rates can't fall much below zero, and other interest
*  rates have to hold spreads relative to safe interest rates, you may not be able to get
*  the system to equilibrate.
*  Even if at a particular moment the safe interest rates are above zero, the awareness that at
*  some future moment when demand falls, you will not be able to reduce interest rates
*  sufficiently operates as a deterrent that holds asset prices and demand down.
*  What's the best framework for thinking about how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy
*  decisions affect emerging economies?
*  There's been work coming out of Princeton, Helen Ray.
*  How well do we understand this, and what framework do you look to first on these questions?
*  I think we don't fully understand why there are so many places where the long-term interest
*  rate is more responsive to what the central bank in Washington does than what the central
*  bank in their capital city does.
*  I think that's an important puzzle that I don't think the economics profession fully
*  understands at this point.
*  I don't know that we've got a framework that is in a profound sense better than the
*  Dornbusch overshooting model for thinking about a range of exchange rate fluctuations.
*  If I think about the economy of Mexico, they have NAFTA, which I've always thought was
*  a good idea.
*  They've done significant reforms.
*  They have a much, much higher level of professionalism in their government than they did several
*  decades ago.
*  Typically, they grow in the range of two to two and a half percent.
*  This to me is somewhat of a puzzle.
*  What's your take on why Mexico hasn't done better?
*  I agree with you that it's a puzzle.
*  If you had described to me in 1995, after the 1996, after our bailout, if you had said
*  to me, this is going to be the quality of Mexican economic management, this is going
*  to be the kind of leadership that Mexico is going to have, how fast do you think they'll
*  grow?
*  I would have expected more convergence with the United States than we've had.
*  I think in terms of understanding it, so I agree with you that it's a puzzle and it's
*  not what I would have expected.
*  I think in terms of understanding it, I would highlight two things.
*  One is Mexico has still some very serious rule of law issues, some very serious security
*  issues associated with risks of becoming more like Colombia than it wants to be.
*  I suspect those are larger issues than many outside Mexico appreciate.
*  I think that's one part of it.
*  I think the other part of it is a much broader phenomenon, which is those who, in some ways
*  I think Mexico's problem is the same problem as Michigan's problem.
*  We have this tremendous phenomenon of globalization and there's some who are able to seize the
*  opportunity to produce and to build supply chains across many countries, to sell their
*  products into a global economy rather than into a domestic economy.
*  And there's some who by being part of the global economy, like hundreds of millions
*  of people in China or India, are lifted to an entirely new level than they were before.
*  But there's a group in between those who are levering the global economy and those who
*  are being pulled along by the global economy who can't really turn the global economy into
*  an opportunity and don't really want to compete with Chinese labor, who are a bit left behind
*  and frustrated.
*  And I think there would be many in Latin America who would be in that group, including Mexico,
*  and I think it's a very profound social and economic problem.
*  Speaking of puzzles, you mentioned China. We're still witnessing this ongoing race between
*  Chinese debt and Chinese nominal GDP, and I would say since maybe 2006, at least I have
*  been expecting some kind of discrete event to occur in China where we all say, uh-oh,
*  now it's happened.
*  It actually hasn't been the case. That to me is a puzzle. And after 11 years, I wonder
*  what's going on. Can you imagine that we're finally at a frontier where you think Chinese
*  nominal GDP can outrace Chinese debt, or do you think we still ought to expect some discrete event?
*  I think it's important to remember that a large part of Chinese debt is explicitly or
*  implicitly government guaranteed, and that the fiscal capacity of the Chinese government
*  is very large, especially given rapid economic growth. And so I think the application of
*  Western thinking that understates the extent to which the debts are really internal government
*  debts probably leads to more alarm about a sudden breakdown of Chinese finances than
*  is warranted.
*  So you could imagine a smooth glide into a lower growth path?
*  I could, I mean, yes, I could definitely imagine, I could definitely imagine that, and you know,
*  my best guess would be that Chinese growth will slow, but I would not be confident that
*  China will have an event like the Asian countries had in 1997. It wouldn't amaze me if they
*  did, but I would not want to predict that within the next five years they will have
*  an event of that kind simply because the government is standing behind so large a part of the
*  economy.
*  Do you worry about the fact that so much is guaranteed that they're simply stacking on
*  top, and at some point you end up getting a lot of bad investment decisions, you only
*  need so many roads or so many high speed rail lines, and until they at some margin pull
*  away those guarantees, they're just doubling down and the debts will get bigger and provincial
*  governments will fall and there'll be defaults on corporate bonds, and then they'll be in
*  a very difficult situation? Or do you think that moral hazard problem they'll somehow
*  on managing to maintain within acceptable levels?
*  I think both are possible. Look, I think there's a very difficult question. You know, you're
*  a rapidly growing Asian country and you decide to build an airport somewhere where there
*  aren't very many people. And you do that because it's going to be cheap to build it now when
*  there aren't a lot of people around and it's important to establish the land. And then
*  15 years later, if you've grown fast, you're a brilliant hero of masterful long-term planning.
*  And if you've grown slow, you're an idiot who was building an airport where nobody wanted
*  to go. And it's hard to know which is the case. And so I think the Japanese probably
*  look stupider than they really were because they built in anticipation of more growth
*  than they in fact were able to generate. And I don't know quite what's going to happen
*  with respect to China. You know, it's not unlike Dulles Airport. Today, we think of
*  Dulles Airport as a important strategic stroke that cemented and made possible a hugely
*  vibrant technological economy in Northern Virginia. I'm old enough to remember in the
*  late 70s or early 80s when it was a generation after Dulles Airport was built and like it
*  was a ridiculous idea built like a million miles from anywhere and like why did we build
*  that? And so I think it's very difficult to judge some of these infrastructure investments
*  except in the very, very long run. And even when you judge them in the very, very long run,
*  you can make a judgment exposed as to whether they were a good idea. But even then, it's going
*  to be even more difficult to make a judgment about whether they were ex ante sensible or ex ante
*  not sensible. If I think about Russia and its recent history, I'm never sure if I should feel
*  it's gone better than we could have expected or if it's gone worse. But if one redos that whole
*  history, and I'm not sure who is the relevant we here, but what could have been done differently
*  and better with regard to Russia, again with the we variable, the choice variable being a bit
*  undefined here, what do you think of as the lost opportunity in that regard or was there none?
*  Well, factually, if you had told any of us who worked with President Clinton as he prepared for
*  his first summit with Boris Yeltsin in 1993, where the Russian economy, Russia's government,
*  and Russian relations with the United States were going to be in 2017, we would have been appalled.
*  Sure, but in 1988, you might have thought it was an okay deal.
*  Right. So by the standards of what one was hoping for in the aftermath of the Berlin Wall falling
*  and the end of the Cold War, where the models would have been West Germany 24 years after 1945,
*  it's 26 years after 1945, you have to say it's been a big
*  big disappointment. And I've thought a lot about that. I think one big part of it is
*  60 years of 60 years of communism, not a clear defeat. It was just harder to have it join the
*  world than it was to repair Europe after the Second World War. And the structural reasons why
*  it was more difficult were things we overestimated. Second, I guess this may be the important point.
*  I think in retrospect, there was not enough respect shown
*  to what once had been a proud nation that didn't think of itself as having been defeated.
*  And that manifested itself in some of the efforts to push NATO very far towards its borders,
*  that manifest itself in the way in which conditionality was applied by the international
*  financial institutions, to some extent by the G7 countries, including the United States.
*  I think there were probably errors in not providing enough funding quickly enough
*  at the very beginning, at the moment of maximum malleability. Those were errors probably primarily
*  of the late Bush administration, but perhaps errors of our administration as well at the beginning of
*  1993. But I think in retrospect, my judgment would be that
*  repairing Russia's economy was a much more difficult challenge than we appreciated.
*  Two final questions. My first one is about what I call the Larry Summers production function.
*  So you were successful at quite a young age, but what I find striking after reviewing a lot of
*  what you've done and a lot of talks you've given is I find at your current age 62 that when you
*  answer questions on YouTube, in general your answers are in some way better or richer than
*  they would have been five, ten years ago, and they were already obviously quite good to have gotten
*  you to where you are. So for people who are already famous and to some extent well off,
*  at the age margin of whatever to 62, for their answers still to be getting better,
*  this is what I find striking. You don't have to be modest here, but what is there in the Larry
*  Summers production function that explains this?
*  Well part of the answer I think is the goes back to the first question that you asked. I've always
*  tried to surround myself and be around extraordinarily able young people, and they probably do learn some
*  things from me, but I learn a lot from them, both from them and from my own experience.
*  I think that's one answer. I think another answer, and by the way I flatter that you think it's true,
*  I don't know if it's true, I don't know if it's true or not, one thing I've always tried to define
*  myself by, and I think that's one of the things that I've always tried to do, is to be able to
*  I don't know if it's true or not, one thing I've always tried to define myself by,
*  and sometimes it's been more successful than other times, is opposition to complacency,
*  and not being satisfied with any institution, with myself or with anybody, and always thinking
*  things can be better, and that's sort of the attitude I have to myself as well. So you know,
*  I'll be on a plane back tonight, and I'll be thinking about the various questions you asked,
*  and which questions I could have given better answers to, and then I'll think about those
*  answers, and the next time I'm somewhere I'll give better answers, or be better at discussing
*  things because I wasn't complacent or satisfied. So those would probably be the answers I'd give.
*  Before Q&A, my final question, this relates to a piece by your wife. She's a professor at Harvard
*  in the English department, Elisa New, and in a magazine called Tablet she has a piece on what
*  she calls final acts, namely wonderful things people do at the very end of their careers. She
*  focuses on Philip Roth and Harold Bloom, and I would ask, can you think of a senior economist
*  you have known or interacted with where they truly ended their career on something wonderful
*  as a sort of final act, where you look at that and admire that, and what would that be?
*  Let me first say... You can cite relatives, by the way.
*  Let me just say I began by saying how much my wife admired you because of your book on food.
*  That will be as nothing compared to the fact that you had looked up her writings
*  in preparation for this interview.
*  That's also not, that's my non-complacency.
*  My Ken Arrow was my uncle, and he was a brilliant man who could talk with extraordinary intelligence
*  on any subject who died this past March at the age of 94. But six months before he died,
*  he was the stalwart with the best attendance record at the Mathematical Economics Institute
*  that he had led for the previous 25 years in Jerusalem. I'm told he was as active as
*  any participant and more sharply contributing than the vast majority. I think to be able to do that
*  at the age of 93 with enthusiasm and zest is extraordinary and is a great example for me
*  and for many others.
*  Larry Summers, thank you very much.
*  For Q&A, we have a microphone. There will be a line. The rule is this is not your time to make
*  statements. The purpose is to ask a question of Professor Summers, and if you make a statement,
*  I absolutely will cut you off. We are all here to learn from Larry Summers. First question.
*  First of all, thank you so much for the great exchange. The question is very simple.
*  U.S. economy, current growth, 2%. Is this really the new normal, which is to say that the post-war
*  average of 3% was an aberration? Or are we going to find new ways? And what will be the new ways?
*  That's the question, to go back to 3%.
*  Mostly new normal because the labor force was growing much more rapidly because of the
*  population dynamics, because of immigration, and because of the tailwind for more women working
*  through most of the post-war period than it's likely to be going forward. So productivity may
*  accelerate a bit, but historical average growth we're unlikely to see.
*  Next question.
*  I'm Mike Nelson. I work for Cloudflare, which is a web security firm, so I'm mostly concerned
*  about the digital economy. And I'm very concerned that economists haven't really explored a lot of
*  really important issues, and as a result, policymakers are making bad choices,
*  uninformed by economics. Example from copyright.
*  Question, question, question.
*  Okay. The question is basically, are there two or three really important issues that economists
*  should be looking at in the world of the digital economy, like the value of copyright, that would,
*  you think, need more attention? So this is a homework assignment for economists looking
*  for hot new topics.
*  I think there's a lot of work to be done on intellectual property. It's marketing and the
*  ways in which intellectual property is enforced. I think there's a lot of work to be done on market
*  structure in digital industries and what constitutes increased competition and what
*  constitutes measures that foreclose competition. And I think there's a lot of work to be done
*  on intangible infrastructures that promote exchange, blockchain being one example,
*  but I don't understand why there should still be three-day financial settlements on anything
*  in the world of today's technology.
*  Thank you. I've got a question about your paper with Natasha Serin. So you talk about the decline
*  of bank franchise value, and you're slightly critical of the regulatory stress tests for being
*  over-reliant on regulatory measures of capital. So my question is, what would you redesign about
*  the CCAR stress tests if you had the chance?
*  I would put more emphasis on market values. It's madness that in the fall, in the spring of 2008,
*  when the stock prices of all the banks was collapsing, everybody was saying they were
*  totally splendidly capitalized and all was well. So I would put more reliance on market
*  instruments. I wouldn't allow the market to satisfy me that everything was okay,
*  because sometimes markets are wrong and they don't see problems. But if markets were alarmed,
*  I would tend to think I should be alarmed as well and to build more of that apparatus,
*  build more of that apparatus. And I think the fact that the stress tests are saying that even if we
*  have an event substantially worse than the 2008 crisis, no bank will need to raise capital.
*  That says more to me about the stress tests than it does about the banks.
*  Thank you. Following up on your remark, the government should pursue policies that are in
*  the interest of their current citizens. Chinese merger law considers both the effect of a merger
*  and acquisition on competition, also considers the effect on the Chinese economy. U.S. merger law
*  was adopted prior to globalization. Should we be considering things like effects on employment
*  and effects on the long-term competitive position of the U.S. economy when we approve mergers?
*  Probably we should pay some attention to measures of long-term economic health.
*  Employment gets me nervous, because if you successfully do something that is much more
*  efficient, the effect will be that you'll compete with somebody and that may lead to reduced
*  employment. But I don't think we want to become France where job preservation is a central goal
*  relative to economic dynamism. In the past few years, have your views on alternative targets for
*  central banks evolved? For example, two years ago you gave an interview to Politico where you
*  discussed GDP targeting. I think secular stagnation is a sufficiently serious problem.
*  The zero lower bound is likely a constraint when an extra session comes. I wouldn't be satisfied
*  with the status quo. Whether a higher inflation target, some form of price level targeting,
*  or some form of nominal GDP targeting is best is not something where I have a certain answer to.
*  Right now I have an instinct towards nominal GDP targeting, since I think it has the attractive
*  attribute that the slower the underlying rate of growth, which would tend to point towards a more
*  serious secular stagnation problem, the higher the level of inflation that you're prepared to
*  tolerate is. So that would be my instinct at this point. But if I had responsibility in this area,
*  I would feel a need to make much more study before coming to a definitive conclusion.
*  If the Trump administration pulls us from NAFTA or the Korean free trade agreement,
*  or both, how great do you see the risk of another depression?
*  Neither the extra trade caused by Korea or NAFTA is large enough relative to our $17 trillion economy
*  to mean that those direct impacts would cause a depression. What the psychological effect of
*  that would be on either of those actions on the global trading system, I think that's harder
*  to say. I cannot imagine a crazier strategy at this instant with what is going on on the Korean
*  Peninsula than for us to say to Korea, we don't have your back, we're fussing around about our
*  trade deficit right now. I cannot imagine a strategy better calculated to foster doubt
*  uncertainty among people who have here to forbid our allies. And so I think it would be a grave
*  error. But I think economists make a mistake most recently in the Brexit debate, when they're quick
*  to say that anything they think constitutes a mistake will cause a depression. And I wouldn't
*  go that far with respect to this.
*  Thank you. I'm a Washington correspondent of the Japanese opinion magazine, The Liberty.
*  And I remember clearly you had been clearly against the consumption tax hike by Prime Minister Abe
*  and your warning has been proved right. And you gave a grade incomplete to Abenomics,
*  I think two years ago, as far as I remember. And Prime Minister Abe declared a couple of weeks ago
*  he would raise the consumption tax again from 8% to 8%. So what do you think will happen after
*  the consumption tax hike? I think there's a huge tendency in Japan and in other countries
*  when you see the first shoots of spring to declare that spring is here and to take down
*  the storm windows and put on the screens. And I think it's usually a mistake. And so I would,
*  if I were in Japan, I would defer increases in the consumption tax at this point.
*  Three more questions very quick. One, two, three, first.
*  Very tall. Good afternoon. My question will relate to federal and state funding on maintaining
*  bridges and roads. Specifically, companies like Amazon use every road in the nation.
*  Warehouse uses its roads to deliver logs, Kimberly Clark to deliver diapers. So assuming that none
*  of these pay 35% tax rate, how would you pursue getting corporate America to fund the maintenance
*  of our infrastructure, bridges and roads? I think we all need to, we all use our roads and we all
*  need to fund our infrastructure. And after all, corporations aren't separate entities,
*  they're creatures of their shareholders. I think there's a lot that can be done to close corporate
*  tax shelters of many different kinds. And I would look particularly at issues relating to earnings
*  stripping and relating to transfer pricing, where profits that genuinely should be taxed in the
*  United States are transferred to tax havens as an alternative would be the first place I'd look.
*  Good afternoon. If you were in charge of Her Majesty's Treasury in England, what would you
*  do over the next few years to help protect the pound? To what? To help protect the pound.
*  To help protect the pound? The pound sterling. The pound sterling. I don't, I'm not sure that if I
*  were head of Her Majesty's, I have to get a new accent, but if I was, other than that, if I was
*  head of Her Majesty's Treasury, I don't think I'd define my objective in terms of the level of the
*  pound. I think I would define my objectives in terms of the level of the British economy. And
*  the first thing I would do is try to talk everybody out of Brexit, which I think is a
*  costly, unforced error. It will ultimately make the British people poorer and less influential
*  in the world. Second thing I would, that's the most important thing. Second thing is if I had
*  to stick with Brexit, I would try to preserve as much common access to the European market as I
*  could as a way of attracting investment. And I guess the last thing I'd say is I would try to make,
*  create an environment that was relatively hospitable to business so I could encourage
*  capital inflows, which would both spur growth and create demand for pounds, which in terms of your
*  question would help preserve the value of the pound. Last, no, that's the end of our questions.
*  Larry, thank you very much.
