# Nate Silver on the Supreme Court and Underrated Stats for Finding Good Food  Convos with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [February 23, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tMA7F4FA94)
*  Nate doesn't need much of an introduction. He is a phenomenon in the areas of data, sports,
*  politics, online media, all the growth sectors basically. So when I think of your work, I
*  think of you as dedicated to the idea of numbers and data and wanting to apply that to as many
*  different areas as possible. If you were to say of all the areas of human life, where
*  can data bring the biggest improvements? What would your answer be?
*  That's a pretty heavy question. I should have taken half an hour to think about that, right?
*  I think the answers are probably obvious in some sense, where health is an area where
*  I've not done a lot of work personally, but I'm sure it's incredibly valuable. Doctors
*  are not known for being terribly analytics driven. I don't know the culture enough as
*  to know why. In terms of areas that I would like us to focus on at 538, a little bit more
*  than we do now, criminality and criminal justice is an interesting area, in part because you
*  have lots of issues with data. If you want to know how many police officers are killed,
*  how many people are killed by police officers, you don't really know that very well. Education
*  is an area where I suspect you have a lot of data used poorly, as well as data used
*  well. Urban planning is something we're fascinated by. We did a big analysis of Uber data that
*  New York City spent like $2 million to conclude, but we concluded on our own in a week or two
*  of work, which is that Uber by and large in New York was not adding cars to the streets,
*  at least not in Manhattan.
*  We're in a law school right now. If we applied a lot more data to the law, what kind of improvement
*  could you imagine we might come up with, just tentatively?
*  I think that might be the last field where you would have a lot of it. I don't say that
*  in a pejorative way at all, but a lot of the advantage of working with datasets and becoming
*  more adept at it is that you get an answer that's at least approximately right, whereas
*  the legal sector, I think, relies more on precision. You want a very precise and possibly
*  wrong answer, which is kind of what you're trying to avoid sometimes when you're doing
*  statistical analysis.
*  I sometimes wonder, how much data do people want? As part of my prep for these, I went
*  back to your high school yearbook and I took a look at the quotation you left. It's from
*  Macbeth. It goes as follows. Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars
*  and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them.
*  It's a little self-righteous, but you're entitled to that when you're in high school.
*  I have no objection to the sentiment, but I've read papers which show when you give
*  a lot of people the chance to view the quality of their hospital or doctor, they're not interested.
*  As a citizenry, how much data do you think people want? Or do you think it's a kind
*  of entertainment where sports, betting, politics, a kind of horse race, it's fine, but real
*  data, do people want to see data on how good or how honest they actually are? Or is it
*  more like the Macbeth quotation?
*  I'm like that. My partner got really into 23andMe, I guess, and one of all this detail.
*  They don't actually tell you all that much, but I don't want to have to stress about a
*  bunch of things that I can't necessarily affect. But I don't know. The notion of empowering
*  people to make better decisions with their own health is a noble notion. I guess I'm
*  kind of enough of a free marketer that I say you should give people information whether
*  they use it well or not. It's kind of their right to have it, but I'm not sure I have
*  a firm conclusion about whether it leads to better decisions or not. Again, my impression
*  is that among doctors and hospital administrators, they're not terribly data driven either despite
*  their obviously rigorous work in other respects.
*  I think of you as a kind of super forecaster, to use Philip Tatlock's term. Do you think
*  you can beat prediction markets? Not all the time, but a smidge in above average. If this
*  were a game and we were all investors, at the end of 30, 40 years, you'd have some excess
*  returns just like Cliff Asness, one of our earlier guests.
*  I think maybe by a very small amount, but not by enough to make up the variance. It
*  depends on what market you're talking about. I think the markets in politics are not all
*  that liquid and not all that sophisticated necessarily. I know the various sports algorithms
*  that we have at 538 have tended to beat Vegas, not by a lot, but will win 52% of the time
*  and so forth on average.
*  That is a lot.
*  It is kind of a lot, but I guess I put it like, this is where I spend a lot of my time
*  thinking about. The dynamics between how markets can be, it's amazingly arrogant in some sense
*  for anyone to think they can beat markets. At the same time, the more worshipful we become
*  of markets, then the less useful they become as well.
*  A lot of times I have people say, well, I know Donald Trump's going to win because he's
*  up to 52%. I think he's a little lower than that now, but one points up to 55% to win
*  the GOP nomination at Betfair. That, I think, doesn't really add any value to the conversation.
*  I'm kind of more interested as a person and as a researcher and journalist in providing
*  information that then other people can aggregate as opposed to either way around, I suppose.
*  But if you talk about how good are political markets, the first question is how good are
*  markets? I think the answer to that is pretty good, but when the distribution of error is
*  not very linear, when they're off, they can be off by a lot. Are you the person who knows
*  when they're off? That's harder to do potentially.
*  What are the differences between forecasting and futurism, and do you have any predictions
*  for the year 2050?
*  They don't have to be great, they just have to be better than the market, right? Take
*  a 52% prediction and go home and celebrate.
*  I think I'm mildly pessimistic in some ways.
*  What's the biggest source of your pessimism?
*  I don't know. There's probably some survivorship bias in the United States and thinking about
*  how our way will persevere forever and ever and ever. We were talking backstage about
*  how you go to Asia and I go to Asia not as often as you. If you want to feel optimistic
*  about civilization, then go there. But I know, some of it is thinking about, frankly, this
*  Donald Trump phenomenon.
*  I've heard of him.
*  Yeah. But it just made me consider that a lot of assumptions a lot of people made about
*  how American politics work are really based on a relatively narrow slice of history. Post-World
*  War II through 2000 or so, maybe even briefer, 1980 through 2000, it's not really a lot
*  of history. In many other contexts, there are all types of places around the world where
*  nationalism is a much bigger phenomenon than it is in the United States. Race and racism
*  is embedded in a great deal of political turmoil in the United States. In some ways, I kind
*  of wondered after the Great Recession, how come we haven't seen more social upheaval
*  and maybe we're seeing that a little bit delayed. It's kind of more of a revolution of rising
*  expectations. At the same time, there is such a tendency now to focus on, I know in politics,
*  people can focus on a very small number of stories that are not representative of the
*  big picture and there's a lot of wonderful news in the world in some sense in terms of
*  poverty rates going down globally, income inequality going down, diseases being eradicated.
*  I wonder to some extent how much the media culture tends to focus a lens on negative
*  aspects of society and lowers people's happiness level and all this type of stuff.
*  More optimistically, how about love and sex? Do you think data can improve matching? Should
*  we just follow the algorithms or do you think that's a perpetual dead end? All the algorithms
*  really do is force you to choose someone, give you a phony reason and get you out of
*  your indecision. I think the market would say that people find online services fairly
*  useful. Maybe it removes some spontaneity. My partner had a bar which kind of almost
*  feels old fashioned now really. It could be like these pills that are sold, the online
*  service, or like a placebo effect. I think there's a lot of over optimization and that's
*  kind of a problem across almost any sector you'd want to talk about where data is being
*  used. You're kind of optimizing for a short term equilibrium and it's much harder to measure
*  the long term. Before if you couldn't measure anything at all then maybe your heuristics
*  aren't that bad. If you can kind of say what's going to make me really happy tomorrow in
*  my business, what's going to get my website the most traffic 36 hours from now isn't necessarily
*  the best decision in the long run. You can measure the short run and not the long run
*  and measure some things and not others that can make you I think quite myopic and is a
*  bigger problem than people realize perhaps. You mentioned Donald Trump a moment ago. I
*  told quite a few people I didn't think Trump could get very far. It's not obvious that
*  I was right. Paul Krugman said pretty early on that Trump had quite a good chance. What
*  is it that Paul Krugman saw that I didn't? I was one of the Trump skeptics too. Let me
*  say I thought you would ask a version of this question. I wasn't allowed to blame you so
*  I put it on myself. I'm still not sure you were wrong but there's something we didn't
*  see. That is important I think. I got a little frustrated because a lot of people were saying
*  Trump's instantly going to evaporate in the polls. If you go back to what we wrote we
*  said that could happen but there are also a lot of candidates, Pappy Cannon and so forth,
*  Ron Paul, Rick Santorum who will get 20, 25, 30 something percent of the electorate and
*  they have a high floor or low ceiling type of candidates. That could still wind up being
*  true but with that said, for one thing we're dealing with a fairly small sample of relevant
*  elections. People look at in the primaries going back to 1972 and I think one very basic
*  lesson is that when you have a sample size of let's say it's roughly 15 there's nothing
*  you can do to make it not a sample size of 15. No matter how compelling you can make
*  your rationalization to say well but we have theory as well as empirics here and still
*  15 cases is 15 cases and I think maybe making people more cautious about saying unlikely
*  versus never. Now the record will show we said unlikely and not never but still it's a lot
*  of things to think about. I don't know. You talk about what super farcesters are supposed
*  to do and you start with priors and you can say the priors that candidates like Donald
*  Trump tend not to win the nomination and so what signs could I find that would violate
*  that assumption? Well it's not necessarily performing well in early polls. Lots of candidates
*  who are flashes in the pan, I guess it's a little tautological, but lots of unusual candidates
*  have done well in early polls. Lots of unusual candidates have won Iowa or New Hampshire,
*  not usually both but one or the other. It's kind of the ability to consolidate the field
*  after that and become a consensus choice of the party that's been more unusual. So
*  that assumption still might prove to be true. I did think though that I and a lot of people
*  overrated the ability of the Republican Party to stop what I think is in some ways a radical
*  insurgency within the GOP. The party's weaker than you thought. What other judgments about
*  the world do you feel you or I should revise that we once held? Like for Paul Krugman I
*  think would say Republicans are more racist than many people believe. It wouldn't be
*  my take in particular but it's a candidate. To be honest that's a little bit of what I
*  wanted to resist. So actually I think one kind of lazy heuristic that in my thinking
*  about Trump that I use is like you know there are exceptions. Paul Krugman, Norman Ornstein
*  who have been very consistent for a long time but I thought the people who were pro-Trump
*  were generally not people whose opinions I would weight as highly. And I think that's
*  like lazy and possibly quite dangerous. You know what I mean? If he chooses to run does
*  Michael Bloomberg have a chance? Well give me a probability. Well if I go to the betting
*  markets this morning I think I saw 2.8 percent. Is that too high or too low relative to what
*  do you think? A 2.8 percent chance of becoming president. It's probably about right. It's
*  about right. I mean obviously in some ways the climate could be as fertile as ever for
*  some type of third candidate running. But Bloomberg I don't know. Number one I'm not sure he
*  differentiates all that well from Clinton with whom he has a lot in common policy wise
*  and Trump with which he's kind of the same character. But the most basic problem is that
*  in election between Sanders and Trump or Clinton and Trump everything is quite left of center.
*  Trump when he was thinking about running as an independent in 1999-2000 had an eccentric
*  platform but involved single-pair healthcare, a wealth tax. He was anti-immigration even
*  but pro-choice. He said explicitly like I'm not bound by any party really. I'll probably
*  reconsider my stance if I become the Republican nominee. So to me the more viable candidate
*  in that case would be like a Mitt Romney, Condi Rice ticket or something like that.
*  Now let's move past the esoterica and give the people what they really want to hear.
*  Now let's go back to 1968 in the World Series. The manager of the Detroit Tigers,
*  Mayo Smith, he took Mickey Stanley, pulled him out of center field and put him in at
*  shortstop so that Jim Northrup could play center and the recovering Al K. Line who was
*  a better hitter, future Hall of Famer, could play in right field. No one had ever done
*  this before. Now you're advising at that time. How do you start thinking about that problem?
*  You know what I'm talking about right? Of course you do.
*  We know a lot more now about the value of defense than we did back in the late 60s or
*  even than we did 10 years ago. And if anything defense turns out to be quite a bit more important
*  than people would have thought. So it was kind of an ironic way when some of the conventional
*  scout wisdom was confirmed as data got more advanced and more sophisticated. Now if you
*  want to get really complicated, the Tigers had Danny McLean and I think Mickey Lulich.
*  They had a strikeout heavy pitching staff. Maybe you worry about defense a little bit
*  less. Tiger Stadium is a part conducive to low batting averages to begin with a little
*  high home run totals. But it's not obvious to me that it was the best move. But it is
*  interesting that all of a sudden baseball teams and football teams become in general
*  more speechly correct when they have more on the line. In the World Series closer usage
*  is a lot better. When you bring your best guy in in the eighth inning or the seventh
*  inning you see in the NFL teams will go for two more often in the playoffs, go for it
*  on fourth down more often in the playoffs. Just kind of a hint that when the stakes are
*  low, culture tends to prevail. When the stakes are high and the outcome of the game is all
*  that matters then things are different. So given your view on Mickey Stanley and the
*  Detroit Tigers, who is the underrated candidate in the Republican race this year? Just to
*  impose a kind of consistency on you. I mean, I don't know. You've got to go along someone,
*  right? There's a hundred dollars to bet. I think the markets are fairly close to correct
*  right now. But you know, I've been a Rubio optimist for a while on the theory that he
*  is the only candidate who really has appeal to all the various sectors and consistencies
*  within the GOP, which may be a fraying party, but still he has the highest availability
*  ratings in the party. I think he speaks the language of conservatives without being too
*  extreme. But you know, the big question in the election right now is where is Trump's
*  ceiling? If you start out at 25%, like he did in Iowa, that's one thing. 35% is much
*  closer to the point where he'd be hard to stop. But even now you see in New Hampshire,
*  even though he won with 35% of the vote, half of Republicans there said they would not want
*  him as their nominee. So you know, the question is can the non-Trump candidates organize
*  themselves into one candidate and then does he stop at 35% or 40 or 45 or 51? If he stops
*  at 51, then it kind of doesn't matter. But you know, I suppose, you know, I think Rubio,
*  what is he at? Like 3 to 1? I think he should be more at 2 to 1 or something. So not a dramatic
*  mispricing.
*  What do you think of the Ted Cruz theory that this election is not about swing voters,
*  that you actually need a somewhat less compromising candidate to bring out the silent conservatives
*  who maybe don't vote and that there's a lot of them and that Cruz is more electable
*  than Rubio? You hear this. There's data on this and what's your opinion of that data?
*  I mean, you know, talk about Pryor's or kind of Occam's razor. If you look at lots and
*  lots of Senate races over time and the reason why that's relevant is because number one,
*  senators are easier to measure their ideology because they legislate and number two, we
*  have a much larger sample size. You can see that there's a price for extremism. Not a
*  price that can't be overcome if we go into a big recession or if Clinton or Bernie has
*  huge problems. But Cruz would probably cost you three or four points relative to the election
*  of the median generic Republican.
*  Last I saw, Bernie's share was at something like 17 cents. At that price, do you go long
*  or short?
*  Probably short, but I think it's also not dramatically mispriced. I mean, I think the
*  thing people miss is that kind of unlike on the GOP side where Trump's at least passed
*  I think the first test, like, you know, he has people who are out there willing to vote
*  for him, there was some doubt about that, especially after Iowa were going to perform
*  their goals. But Sanders, we haven't really seen, can he win states that are not very
*  white and very liberal? Maybe he can. Nevada seems to be pretty close. I'm just saying
*  we haven't really received that much information that would make you update your priors about
*  Sanders all that much. He also probably has to win by, with a little bit of room to spare.
*  If it's a tie, then Clinton will probably win on the basis of superdelegates if she
*  loses by a couple points, but it's close enough. So if you're an underdog in a football game
*  and you lose unless you win by more than a field goal, that actually reduces your win
*  probability quite a bit. If you're the favorite already, then maybe it wouldn't, but that's
*  tricky. When underdogs win, they tend to win narrowly. And if Clinton wins some of the
*  races she should have won or should have lost, because superdelegates turn a narrow Bernie
*  win by a field goal into, oh, after further review, you know, we're going to have an overtime
*  quarter, superdelegates will weigh in instead, then I don't know. I think 10 or 15 percent
*  somewhere in that range is probably about right.
*  We may come back to politics, but let's turn to a nobler endeavor, sports. Now, you're
*  a fan of baseball, and I'd like to ask you, of all the different baseball records, which
*  is the one that is most impressive to you or the most statistical aberration, and try
*  to stay a bit modern. So we both know in 1889, Hoss Radborn won 59 games. You know, start
*  with, like, Wilson's 36 dribbles in 1912, that and up through the modern age. What's
*  the most statistically impressive baseball record and why?
*  I mean, I think the biggest outlier is the number of intentional walks that Barry Bonds
*  drew in what year it was, 2001, where he had, like, 161 intentional walks, and the next
*  closest player is 50. There's just no other example I can think of in sports where the
*  record holder has three times the sum total of the nearest highest player.
*  And what do you think of streaks? Do streaks impress you more or less than most people?
*  So DiMaggio's hitting streak, consecutive games played streak, Cal Ripken, number,
*  Johnny VanDermere, two no-hitters in a row. When will that be done again?
*  I'm sure you've read, this is another area where kind of the simple, cybermetric answer
*  might not have been totally correct, but there was a lot of talk for a long time about how
*  the hot hand theory was false, and how basically things are random to a first approximation.
*  Now there's more evidence arguing against that, and in fact, you know, it's a classic
*  mistake, but if you have a test that has low power, then you may mistake an ambiguous result
*  for a negative result instead. But, you know, it appears now that there is some streakiness
*  as you would expect. You would expect that there are some variations in human behavior
*  from day to day. It's kind of amazing that being professional athletes, there's less
*  streakiness than you might think. But still, now we're getting actually data too that's
*  less noisy. So we now get data, for example, for major league hitters, how hard the ball
*  comes off their bat. So we have some unpublished research that a colleague of mine is doing,
*  but it looks like you can maybe predict batting average, up or down, or on base average, 20
*  or 30 points from a baseline. Which in baseball terms is pretty relevant. If you have a guy
*  hitting a leadoff spot because he's a 370 O.B.P. hitter, and he's really 340 based on his
*  current condition, then he should maybe be demoted down to the A spot in the lineup instead.
*  So, you know, this is true of a lot of things where, you know, the first cut from data is
*  overly simplified. You kind of refine over time to something which is a little bit more nuanced.
*  What do you think is the strongest piece of data-based evidence we have that sports analytics
*  work? And let me give you an example. As you know, the Houston Rockets are run by Darrell
*  Morrie. Number's an intensive guy. He's from MIT. Seems to be super smart. And right now,
*  the big debate in Houston is which of their two star players they should trade, or maybe both,
*  and they may not even make the playoffs. So how good is the best regression showing data analytics
*  even work in sports? I mean, the Golden State Warriors might be one of the best examples.
*  But, you know, examples. So clearly, let's say it increases your variance. So the good
*  examples will look really good. But as a predictor, you know, how hard should we be selling it?
*  What's the average impact, the marginal impact? Well, you kind of, you talked a little bit
*  before about how hard it is to beat markets. So there's a little bit of this, too, in sports.
*  Actually, a colleague of mine, Ben Lindbergh, just wrote a book that's not published yet,
*  but I was reading about Sohi and Sam Miller, another baseball stat head, were given basically
*  ownership of a minor league team in Sonoma, California for a year. And they kind of had
*  carte blanche, but they encountered baseball culture in a very head-on way. And the other
*  team did pretty well. It was a very obscure minor league. But, you know, if you can, if
*  the baseline is making half your decisions right and you make 55% of your decisions right
*  or 53% right because you're using analytics, like, that's a pretty big gain at the margin.
*  And yet in a sport as noisy as baseball, it's going to take a lot of time to show up.
*  Basketball is less noisy, I will grant you, but in general, I mean, I think, you know,
*  the Spurs are fairly analytics-friendly and the Rockets and the Warriors, and, you know,
*  I think basketball is probably the best example.
*  Let me ask you about a sport which I find totally baffling, soccer. There's not much of a natural
*  time unit. It's why it's hard to squeeze in commercials, not many points. There are assists,
*  not many. They're not always well-defined. Defense, my goodness, is more confusing to this
*  American than cricket. Yet market salaries of soccer players are determined. There's some papers
*  on market salaries. The small amount of data we have seem to predict those salaries very well.
*  So the fact that soccer behaves in normal ways, does this mean, A, we can still get it all done
*  with limited data, or does it mean, B, having more data doesn't really help us that much and all of
*  sports is a bit like soccer and are ultimately just throwing up our hands and saying, my goodness,
*  might as well be cricket?
*  I mean, so I feel like I'm answering all your questions the same way, which is that, like, which is, you know,
*  analysis is far from perfect. It will make lots of mistakes, right? At the same time, you know, pretty good
*  is hard to beat sometimes. And the kind of, the heuristics that develop over time, but how to value
*  the data in different positions in soccer, you know, they kind of appropriately don't value goalkeepers
*  all that much, which the analytics seems to bear out, for example. But I do think, though, in soccer
*  that, you know, we're at the very early stages and partly like there hasn't really been very much
*  data collected at all. It's not like in the NBA where you had
*  blocks and steals, very crude defensive stats. I mean, literally, and we built a system
*  for ESPN a few years ago where the only data that's been kept in the long term in soccer is
*  goals and bookings, red cards and yellow cards. So it's not like we have
*  assists until recently. It's not like we have tackles.
*  You can maybe get time on the pitch if you parse play-by-play records. We don't have crossing
*  passes. And so, you know, I think there's still a lot of room
*  for upward improvement in soccer.
*  We live in a global economy with billions of laborers. Why don't more of them learn the knuckleball?
*  Wilbur Wood, Hoyt Wilhelm, they were not athletic. The pay's pretty high.
*  R. A. Dickey won the Cy Young Award in 2012 with a knuckleball, which he taught himself.
*  People put labor into a lot of endeavors, but why so few knuckleballers? Why isn't that a more
*  regularized statistical process? Why so lumpy?
*  So I have two answers. One answer is that there are diminishing returns in the number of knuckleballers
*  in the league. So when you have a second knuckleball in the National League, when you already have
*  R. A. Dickey, that already discernibly affects the success of both pitchers.
*  But, you know, I think there is a second thing, which is that
*  sports tends to engender conformism. A lot of walks of life do.
*  And, you know, I mean, that's the whole tension, again, that kind of comes up, is on the one hand,
*  knowing that the market is usually pretty good,
*  but on the other hand, that there are powerful biases to conform.
*  So Trump is like the knuckleballer of politics then?
*  Yeah. That's not a bad...
*  He throws the knuckleball at Jeb Bush. Jeb is baffled. Maybe now he's finally coming up with a response.
*  Well, look, the other kind of statistical way to think about it is that when you have something which is unusual, then there's a bigger
*  error bar around it, right? So you could say, well, I think Trump is, on average,
*  going to get less of the vote than someone who's much higher than him in the polls, but
*  he's got a much longer tail on either side, and so therefore that's one reason to
*  not be dismissive of him, at least in the early going when everyone was kind of a long shot, at least.
*  Now, in all of these interviews in the middle segment, we do a little kind of game. It's called underrated versus overrated.
*  And I name a few things, and you tell me if you think they're underrated or overrated, and you're free to pass on any
*  you don't want to have an opinion on. New York City, the upper east side.
*  Overrated or underrated? Are they really that happy in Seinfeld?
*  And how do they afford that apartment anyway?
*  I think a little overrated, but look, New York is actually
*  extremely efficiently priced. We did an analysis for New York Magazine a few years ago where we tried to
*  say what's the best neighborhood, and the problem is that
*  cost accounts for an R squared of like .93 with our quality index or something.
*  And so it's really hard to
*  improve your lot in New York, at least at the neighborhood level, but
*  I don't know. It's hard to find good hole-in-the-wall places to eat in the...
*  Although some ramen shops are getting better. I basically judge everything by food.
*  The shortest avenue in Manhattan, Fourth Avenue, it's what?
*  Six blocks long. Overrated or underrated? I think underrated. You probably saw my list a few weeks ago
*  where it's short, but it's in a very dynamic section of town.
*  Even with all the used bookstores closed down. Length isn't everything. Length isn't everything, okay.
*  The idea of legalizing drugs. Overrated or underrated?
*  By this crowd, probably rated
*  properly, but...
*  I don't know. I'm enough of a kind of lowercase L libertarian
*  where I think that the government ought to have a stronger reason
*  to intervene in choices that people are making instead of a lesser reason
*  necessarily. To me, it clearly makes no sense to treat
*  marijuana as being a more serious substance than
*  alcohol, for example. I don't think in my heart of hearts if I
*  were running for office or in the Senate or something that I would vote for a bill to
*  legalize heroin or cocaine, but decriminalizing it
*  perhaps. But I don't know. I think
*  the kind of consequentialist case for a long time
*  probably underrated and maybe have gone a little bit too far in the other direction, but
*  again, I would say if it's close, then you give people the choice.
*  The musical group, My Bloody Valentine. They put out an album in 2013
*  after almost a 20 year hiatus. Few people expected this album. It was called MBV.
*  Overrated or underrated? The group or the album? The album. We know the group's
*  underrated, right? Yeah, the group's one of my favorite bands. I think the album was properly
*  rated. Singapore, overrated or underrated?
*  Underrated except by you. But I saw exactly
*  why you would like it. It has great food. It's like a little laboratory
*  experiment. We were talking before about how
*  Singapore is a city that would hypothesize that if you have a few
*  constraints that might seem slightly strange, then
*  maybe having a few strange constraints is helpful. When you talk about the strange
*  constraints, my sister lived in Germany for a while and she's like, well, yeah,
*  if you're there in the shop and they're going to close at four, it doesn't matter if you have a huge
*  line of groceries, the store will close down and you have to put your stuff back and so you can
*  come back tomorrow, which kind of seems irrational. But Germany's a country that has weird little
*  quirks and constraints and yet seems to be doing fairly well
*  in certain ways or Scandinavia or something. So if you kind of give up a little bit
*  of freedom to have more freedom, there's like a Bjork lyric which is, I thought I could organize freedom
*  how Scandinavian of me. Singapore feels a little bit that way too.
*  I have a big compound question. It's about a few things. Feel free to touch on it what you want.
*  One of them is sports. One is fantasy sports and one is gambling.
*  And they're all interrelated. But what's your take on what do these actually do for us?
*  How socially productive are they? So you're of a mixed mind on drug legalization.
*  I could ask a comparable question about gambling, either legalization or liberalization,
*  but what's the net social externality on this mix of sports,
*  fantasy sports, gambling? What's your view?
*  I'm biased. My living is a...
*  So one of the things about the regular
*  fantasy football league that you're in with your friends is that you get a lot out of it.
*  You get to hang out with people you might not see very often, especially as you get older into your 30s or 40s or whatnot.
*  You get to watch a lot of games with more of a rooting interest.
*  The thing about daily fantasy sports is that a lot of that is really taken away.
*  It's very much like a brute force approach to watching sports.
*  I did this for a few weeks and then got bored with it. Basically I had a program that would randomly generate high-scoring lineups.
*  Then you scrape that data and you load it up 200 lineups at a time.
*  It took all the joy out of it, but it's not quite what you're asking, really.
*  Right.
*  I think...
*  What if people just watch sports? Like I watch sports. If it's a good game, I enjoy it.
*  I don't feel I need to gamble on it. I don't want rotisserie. I want to read analytics.
*  I want to read you or your people at 538 on the game, which is great, and then watch the game and I'm done.
*  If they're good players, I'm happy.
*  What am I missing?
*  For one thing, gambling and fantasy sports are a good way to teach people applied analytics.
*  I'm not being jokey. I think this has probably a measurable benefit to society.
*  This is a case where unlike drug legalization, where there are not a lot of countries where drugs apart from marijuana,
*  even there fairly rarely, worldwide people are much more relaxed about gambling.
*  It's normalized. You can go to the betting shop, any Ladbrokes anywhere in the United Kingdom,
*  and place a bet. It doesn't seem to ruin society.
*  Maybe you have in low-paying leagues or in tennis the occasional betting scandal,
*  which is not great, but I think it's a way for a substantial amount of people to get involved.
*  I think it's a way for a substantial number of people to enjoy sports and develop critical thinking skills.
*  I say if it's close, let people do it, and I feel that way about gambling.
*  In that case, you do have examples of many, many westernized countries where betting on sports is legal,
*  and there seems not to be at least grave societal harm.
*  I think that's a good way to teach people.
*  You run the website, 538. It's your vision.
*  You founded it. You developed it. You took it to ESPN.
*  Over those years, what would you say is the most important thing you've learned about managing?
*  Basically, there are three fundamental strategies of management
*  when you have a disagreement with one of your employees.
*  One of which is you can give up.
*  You can say, well, I'm not going to pick this battle to fight
*  because there's a consequence to loaning this person's morale, or I'm tired, I have other issues.
*  You can capitulate.
*  Number two, you can fiat. You can say, well, sorry, but I'm ultimately the one who signs your checks,
*  or my boss signs their checks, but this is the line of authority,
*  and we're not going to publish that article. I'll explain my mind later on.
*  Number three is you can try and persuade instead,
*  which sounds perfect, except persuasion is really, really time consuming.
*  So figuring out which ones of those three tactics to use
*  and in what ratio is, I think, important.
*  I actually found, overall, that there's a little bit more value
*  in micromanagement than I thought. Not about everything,
*  but strategically saying I'm going to spend a lot of time going into detail on this one.
*  I guess it's just kind of mentoring, I guess, is a way to put it.
*  Which sports coach or manager are you most like? Vince Lombardi, Greg Popovich?
*  Who do you draw inspiration from, and do you think about it in these terms?
*  I'm not arrogant enough to compare myself to Popovich.
*  I'm laissez-faire, but when I weigh in on something, I'll weigh in pretty directly.
*  I think you basically have to pick your battles a little bit,
*  but you have to hire really well.
*  It's a culture of creatives and a culture of journalists,
*  and journalists are strange and wonderful people, and data journalists are still journalists too.
*  But you have to trust people to make their own decision.
*  A big thing too is figuring out which one of my deputies,
*  and editors on the staff, what's my agreement ratio with them?
*  It's incredibly valued to have someone who, without your intervention,
*  agrees with you 80% of the time, and then 20% of the time that they don't agree with you,
*  that they're right, as often as not.
*  If it goes to 95%, then they're a sycophant, and it's probably bad.
*  If it goes to 50%, then you might as well do the work yourself.
*  So forget the people who will listen to you, but also challenge you at the right times.
*  You mentioned food before. Let's take a data-intensive approach to food.
*  You're trying to find a good place to eat. What is the underrated statistic about a restaurant
*  that you will consult, or advocate others consult, in this endeavor?
*  That's a fairly basic one, but I'd rather look at Yelp or CripAdvisor.
*  The number of reviews is a better signal than the average star rating.
*  Especially the number of reviews relative to how long a place has been open.
*  We've done some work on this too, where when you're drawing from a more diverse segment of people,
*  there's some theory I want to invent about how every book on Amazon,
*  in the long run, gravitates toward having four stars.
*  A lot of 9-11 conspiracy books are rated pretty well on Amazon,
*  because only the conspiracists bother to read them.
*  Whereas Othello or Macbeth, or something everyone reads,
*  a lot of kids have to read it for homework when they don't want to, necessarily, until they leave a bad review there, potentially.
*  I think that problem is more acute than people might realize when it comes to restaurants,
*  where a place that's notorious will draw in people who might not like that cuisine as much.
*  When I go, and I used to do more Yelping and stuff like that,
*  if I go to a mom-and-pop place in a small town somewhere,
*  and it's not very good, there's almost no way that I'm going to leave a negative review for that place.
*  I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
*  There's actually studies showing that a one-star Yelp review can cost thousands of dollars in business
*  for a restaurant that has under 50 reviews, or something like that.
*  So in New York City, is there better food on the avenues or the streets?
*  I've read you on this.
*  New York is weird, because there are three New Yorks from a culinary perspective.
*  There's rich, Michelin-starred New York.
*  There's hip, SoHo, and Williamsburg New York.
*  And there's ethnic New York, for lack of a better term.
*  And making sure that you have a mental list of places from all three types of those.
*  There are some rules that work well in one of those lanes that don't work well in the others, necessarily.
*  In the very high-end restaurants of New York, it's so competitive
*  that I think your rule about, oh, order the weirdest thing on the menu.
*  I think there are parts of New York where that probably isn't true, because it's so hypercompetitive
*  that the menu couldn't afford to leave people astray.
*  And the menu is very clearly pointing you toward New York, is the kind of thing that you would want to order instead.
*  That might not be true if you go out to Queens, or something like that.
*  Where, frankly, pound for pound, probably the food is better than Manhattan or Brooklyn.
*  But yeah, I mean, you could write a whole book, and maybe I will.
*  Especially if we have Trump winning the election or something.
*  I think he's got heuristics for eating food in New York.
*  I said before, and I'll tell the whole crowd, one of my dreams is that someday you write
*  The Quantitative History of New York City, and this would be one of my favorite books.
*  Question about the weather, weather reporting.
*  There's some evidence that there's what is called wet bias, so storms are over forecast.
*  So it's true the further downstream you go.
*  The local meteorologists here in Virginia or in Washington on TV, they want to get high ratings.
*  They're trying to scare us. It's like they want the Iraq War, so to speak, so people turn on CNN.
*  The irony, though, is that the data the government produces is very well calibrated
*  and doesn't really have a wet bias. There are a few individual models for winter weather that do.
*  I don't know, it's been kind of interesting in my shoes going from someone who was a total outsider
*  to someone who has more reputational risk.
*  To a first approximation, I think it might make someone a worse forecaster potentially.
*  By the way, another thing about the Trump thing I've been thinking about is
*  that the weather is not always the same.
*  My kind of early view that Trump had a very low chance, not zero but very low,
*  of winning the nomination was not based on any formal model per se.
*  I wonder what if I had even a fairly bad model instead.
*  The good thing about building a fiscal model is that it commits you to rules.
*  Instead of just saying, well, I'm going to go with the general rule, I'm going to go with the general rule.
*  The good thing about building a fiscal model is that it commits you to rules.
*  Instead of saying, well, early polls aren't very predictive and your prior is that Trump probably won't win,
*  therefore probably not, it kind of pins you down and says,
*  well, okay, early polls aren't predictive, but at one point did it become more predictive.
*  When Trump went from being at 25% in the polls to 35%
*  after Paris and San Bernardino, how significant is that?
*  To have an answer that is set up by an algorithm
*  you designed ahead of time I think is actually maybe more helpful than people would think.
*  I guess a kind of long way of saying is that I'm not sure that I'm
*  any better than the average pundit unless I have a model.
*  And the disciplining effect of a model, doing your thinking in advance
*  and setting up rules of evidence I think is probably quite important.
*  I have a question about the economics and sociology of sports. This has puzzled me for a while.
*  You may have thought about this, but I'm struck by the relatively small number of professional athletes
*  who have come out as being gay. In Hollywood it's a lot of people.
*  Even in Washington, which is a very conservative town, I wouldn't say it's a lot of people,
*  but it happens in a quiet kind of way.
*  In sports, why is there so little? And if we applied some kind of economic or statistical model,
*  in which sports would you expect to see the new breakthroughs coming when they come?
*  Well, I mean, I'm sure there are
*  a lot of athletes in the closet. I don't assume that it's four or five percent or whatever the
*  population average is. I assume it's a fair amount lower than that.
*  But I don't know. I think people forget about how much the economics change
*  when you're talking about people who are in the 0.001 percent
*  of something, right? Where the fact that until fairly recently,
*  until maybe a few years ago and in many parts of the country, obviously still now,
*  until fairly recently, growing up gay
*  is something that was, if not traumatic, at least required a lot of
*  bandwidth, right? It requires a lot of energy.
*  The fact that, for example, there's data from Freakonomics about how
*  hockey players are born in January, right? Just because they start a little bit
*  earlier than their peer group, that's a very powerful effect versus being born in November
*  or December instead. So if something
*  that minor can have that profound an effect, where I don't know if there's like twice as many NHL players
*  from January as December, then something as important to your identity as being gay
*  in a society that until recently didn't accept it, that's a competitive disadvantage.
*  Maybe there are also correlations in what kind of skills and traits people have.
*  I don't know, but we'll see. I guess the prediction, if that theory is true, is that
*  as it's become more normalized and now people who are
*  growing up in middle school and in high school where being gay is not as much
*  of a disadvantage, then you'd expect from that generation there to be substantially more
*  gay athletes. And in which sport will that happen first? What's the implied prediction?
*  So we see a bit of it in women's tennis, right?
*  Women's tennis. Individual sports maybe over team sports? Yes, no?
*  Yeah, you would think that in tennis and golf you might see it first.
*  The NBA where talent is so manifest
*  and one player can make so much difference, right? I mean LeBron James could come out
*  as gay tomorrow and I think it would not hurt his ability to get a Max Max Plus contract
*  at all. But it could hurt endorsements. It could hurt
*  endorsements. I mean he is kind of a high default, right?
*  But I don't know. I think it's no longer about kind of the marketing side of it so much
*  is the fact that just kind of, I don't know,
*  sports is still a very conformist culture.
*  So the reason why I might say the NBA is I think it's a little bit more individualistic as a culture
*  and guys are free to express themselves more and
*  express themselves. Listen to baseball players talk. They're boring as hell, right?
*  Kevin Durant or something, these guys are smart and they're interesting. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, right?
*  And so I would think basketball might be a sport where you'd see it relatively soon.
*  Let me ask you a general question about forecasting and I worry about this in the context
*  of finance. So I see a lot of money managers. So there's Ray Dalio at Bridgewater.
*  He saw one basic point about real interest rates, made billions off of that over a great run.
*  Now it's not obvious he and his team do any better than anyone else. Peter Lynch,
*  he had fantastic insights into consumer products. Use stuff, see how you like it, buy that stock.
*  He believed that in an age when consumer product stocks were taking off.
*  Warren Buffett, a certain kind of value investing. Worked great for a while, no big success, a lot of big
*  failures in recent times. Is it possible, like the so-called true model
*  is always shifting and there's a kind of selection bias where different forecasters are
*  elevated and they have their run for three, five, however many years and then the true model
*  shifts and what they're good at isn't valued and we have to turn them over, replace them with other forecasters.
*  As like our best forecaster, do you worry about this?
*  Oh sure, yeah. I mean even if you are skeptical about the efficiency
*  of markets, if you have a great gig and you're kind of picking up a hundred dollar bills off the ground
*  then boy, if you can extend that by three or five years
*  without adapting and evolving, I mean that's on the extreme high end.
*  I think three or five years is a kind of very long and fortunate run.
*  That's part of why, even though now we're very immersed in the election cycle
*  but that's part of why I wanted to make sure that Phi 38 was not just
*  an election site. We're going to blow an election center later, we might blow this one.
*  And to be doing a whole diverse array of things, both kind of intellectually
*  and commercially I think is important. I mean the next question that followed up is are there people who have
*  the skills to find the next underweighted opportunity
*  and maybe, you know that's trickier, but yeah I think a lot of people
*  have one or two really good insights
*  and if you're very lucky then that can take you a long way.
*  Here's a related worry. It's clear in the data, stock market volatility is correlated with itself over time.
*  So if you have some volatile days you're likely to get more. That's pretty clear.
*  So that's another way of saying those returns for a while are hard to forecast and stay hard.
*  So this year politically, it's already a big surprise to me, to a lot of people.
*  Could it be the case we're entering a new era where political volatility is higher
*  and basically all forecasters will just do much worse than they've been doing?
*  Well I mean again I kind of go back and say what people take to be the equilibrium
*  baseline condition may actually have been an outlier
*  instead. You have this relatively stable kind of long boom
*  politics and economics from the 50s through the 90s or the early 2000s
*  thereabouts and that could potentially reverse itself. Again to looking at
*  some examples outside of the United States I think is
*  instructive. Maybe I'm kind of more of a believer in American exceptionalism than I thought
*  but you see constituencies that are Trumpian
*  in different parts of Europe and have been extant for a long time
*  so maybe America just got really lucky for
*  50 years.
*  So there's the example of plane crashes. Planes used to crash a lot for pretty normal reasons.
*  Well the engine would fall apart. Obviously we invested more resources in making planes safer.
*  I just read in the Wall Street Journal last year there were actually zero deaths
*  from jetliner crashes other than terror attacks. So we have strange events like the
*  German wings pilot flying into the Alps. Malaysian air disappears. No one knows why.
*  So the events people talk about were left only with the weird ones.
*  So do you think we're headed toward a future where we're only going to be talking about weird
*  very hard to forecast events precisely because we get good at avoiding a lot of problems and
*  mistakes? For sure right. I mean there's some super metaphor
*  I use in the book where one of the problems with
*  comparing how short stops play for example is that you always kind of evaluate players who are on the
*  edge of their range. Can they make the spectacular diving catch?
*  And to a first approximation everyone is equally good at the edge of their
*  range right. But the question is how much territory do they cover in between the non-spectacular plays
*  that we can miss potentially.
*  And it's probably more true, you know, one reason why I like when we forecast
*  spores is you have a chance to build up your sample size. A perfectly routine
*  you know, wizards versus cavaliers game where we have the cows savored at home
*  and they win. That counts. You get hundreds and hundreds of those over the course of a season.
*  Whereas in politics you're kind of more drawn to the spectacular and the
*  weird events and you know, a lot of models are
*  good heuristics when conditions are fairly normal and they don't deal all that well
*  with the edge cases because they're fully designed or because
*  you have non-linearity or because they have small sample sizes or whatever else.
*  But you know, how well do models deal with the weird cases versus other
*  types of heuristics? I'm not sure. Maybe the advantage is more in the kind of
*  baseline cases instead.
*  Other than skilled with data, what are the personal qualities of good predictors?
*  I think you have to have a certain mistrust
*  of conventional wisdom. That's a tricky thing, right? On the one hand
*  we know that I'm not that smart, that this room is way, way, way, way smarter than me
*  and a market is way, way, way smarter than me. At the same time, you know, people are social
*  beings and they kind of behave in herd sometimes. This is easier
*  in politics than almost any other field because the political press
*  is kind of a herd.
*  It's like the perfect example of it where you have a few hundred journalists who travel around
*  together who are all reading one another on Twitter, who are all talking to one another.
*  It's not like 500 really smart people, it's like one or two really smart people and
*  489 followers instead.
*  I think that's kind of what's causing the bubbles and a little bit of trouble I think
*  at 538 at times because we are fairly combative.
*  For a long time I kind of thought, well, this is kind of part of my personality and the kind of
*  more happy warrior data side is part of it too. I think they're actually kind of sides of the same coin.
*  When you read the New York Times or the Post,
*  you see today Donald Trump was in Arizona.
*  But when there's a piece of analysis that isn't necessarily obvious to say,
*  boy, there might be a 40% chance that that's basically wrong, right?
*  You know, that leaves you in a weird place kind of.
*  But to believe that is I think the source of a lot of the healthy skepticism that we have and also some of our
*  failings sometimes.
*  Now let me get to the question that maybe the crowd most wants to hear. Who will be the next
*  president of the United Arab Emirates?
*  Now this is a trick question because it's a hereditary monarchy. But here's my background question.
*  Intelligence agencies and scholars did very poorly forecasting the Arab Spring
*  and did very poorly forecasting ISIS.
*  So you're put on the case. Someone from Washington, McLean, wherever, they call you in.
*  They say, what variables should we be looking at to understand the Middle East that we're underweighting right now?
*  I know it's a tough question, but who will be the next president of United Arab Emirates?
*  Will there be a next president? How do you think about what's happening there? Black swans or
*  a regularized process?
*  The one, we all have certain compromises. I don't know that much about international politics, even enough in a fun setting like this
*  to speculate all that much.
*  I flew via Emirates Airlines. It's like my extent of my knowledge about the UAE pretty much.
*  Not this election cycle, but four more years out, this nation.
*  What's your best pick for who will be elected president?
*  Who will be president in 2020? Correct.
*  I mean, the boring pick is probably Hillary Clinton still.
*  Okay, and number two? Next best pick?
*  I think it's close between Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.
*  Although I think Trump might be a one-termer.
*  If that. Who's the most likely next vice president?
*  John Kasich maybe? Seems like
*  Taylor May for the vice presidential.
*  Even if you think Hillary is more likely to win, he may be the single individual most likely to be the next vice president.
*  Is that the right way to frame it? I think that might be. Hillary has a very long list to pick from.
*  A lot of tactical objectives that she would want to fulfill. I think it's probably a shorter list for the GOP.
*  Can we apply data analysis to figure out the next Supreme Court pick? Again, not to know who it will be,
*  but to get that 52% edge up on what other people are thinking.
*  Potentially. There are some kind of fledgling attempts at
*  Supreme Court analytics. Although this is also a case where we're kind of in a sample size of zero.
*  Where you have a nominee who is very unlikely to be confirmed, but they're still high
*  political stakes. My
*  uninformed guess would be maybe Srinivasan who is confirmed 97 to nothing. I would tend to think that
*  my hunch, and this is just a hunch, is that
*  the theory is that either Obama nominates someone with unimpeachable credentials
*  and makes Republicans look very unreasonable, or he
*  makes a pick that kind of trolls Republicans and plays
*  to the Democratic base. I'm more of a believer in
*  the former as Obama's mode of doing things.
*  I think he'd kind of push things either way and have someone who might just be at the risk of
*  pissing off the liberal base, but the Republicans have to look ridiculous
*  opposing as opposed to the other way around.
*  My last question before we get to the crowd. As you said before, we have a lot of same interests.
*  Food, travel, sports. Sure, politics counts as one of mine, but in a broad sense politics.
*  You've taken a lot of trips, some for work, some vacation. If you apply
*  data analysis to those trips, what do you learn about
*  what makes for a good trip and what can you do or what can we all do to have better trips?
*  I just love travel.
*  I had an unintended experiment where I went to Hawaii for
*  two Christmases ago. For some reason I sat on my phone and my phone
*  didn't work. We were flying through Portland for some reason.
*  We were flying New York to Kansas City to Portland to Honolulu, don't ask why.
*  The day I was in Portland I was panicked. We drove way after this strip mall
*  on the edge of town. You have to wait in line two hours for us to replace your phone.
*  I didn't have a phone in Hawaii and it was the most amazing thing.
*  You've repeated that experience each subsequent trip.
*  No.
*  I was in Thailand this Christmas and I had to build the primary
*  election model. Your enjoyment goes down a lot. A little bit of work
*  but working 20% of the time I think reduces your enjoyment by 70%.
*  Here's how we're going to do questions. We have two mics,
*  one on each side. We'll run two queues. I will alternate. These are
*  questions for Nate to speak to. They are not statements. If you start making a
*  speech or statement, I will cut you off even though we do not have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
*  here. This will suffice. Please ask a question and it's fine to introduce
*  yourself if you wish. Then Nate will respond. I will start
*  over here. First question. Please.
*  Hi. My name is Caleb. We talked a little bit earlier about Superforecasters. I was wondering
*  if you've ever considered incorporating the work of Superforecasters into FiveThirtyEight?
*  You mean literally the guys who wrote the book?
*  Or getting a market of Superforecasters to help you make your models better?
*  I guess I find
*  crowdsourcing sort of boring.
*  As a journalist I find it boring. Even though if you're
*  in a business setting that's exactly what you should do.
*  We actually are doing that a little bit with the Oscars this year. We kind of found eight different
*  people who created different models and we're seeing how well they do. Of course,
*  six awards is not anywhere near as efficient sample size to deal with something like
*  that. I don't know. I think
*  I'm very process driven as a person. For me a lot of the joy
*  is in thinking through the process of it. Reading a book like this is really useful
*  because I talk about a process I think is pretty great. To actually publish the
*  projections in some sense is almost beside
*  the point in the sense that you're still probably dealing with sample sizes that are too small to really tell
*  you all that much. When you start to do that then I think it kind of takes the focus away from
*  thinking about process and heuristics for forecasting. It's kind of
*  an unsatisfying answer I guess.
*  We've printed out a lot of Nate's columns. Many of them are here so there's plenty you can ask about.
*  Hi, I'm Michael Willie. Thanks for coming. If it winds up being Clinton versus Trump,
*  is that the first time where we've had two candidates with the highest unfavorables going against each
*  other? Yeah, I would think so. There have been a few candidates. Romney was
*  basically breakeven when he was nominated as Obama was.
*  But Clinton is negative ten and Trump is negative, excuse me,
*  25 or something. There probably will be some reversion to the mean
*  in both cases. Remember, one reason why, and I'd say Trump's a fairly heavy
*  underdog if he wins a nomination, but it's a conditional probability.
*  Conditional in having won the GP nomination, Trump will have had to display
*  some staying power, some acumen because sooner or later he will have to get
*  beyond 35% to win 50% or so.
*  And probably will have done something to improve his image with people who are not
*  in his core constituency. But yeah, it would be pretty
*  unprecedented, certainly. I wonder if you have to adjust
*  and basically you have to adjust stats for the era where if you're in the
*  home run or steroid era, then 50 home runs doesn't matter as much. Like maybe now,
*  Obama with a 48% approval rating is at like a 56% park adjusted
*  rating. I'm not sure, maybe.
*  Next question. Hi, my name's Tom. Earlier Tyler brought up the question,
*  how much data do people want? It was a two-part question.
*  Does the amount of data that people want, is that influenced by the way
*  that data is presented? And the second part would be, what advice would you give as far as
*  presenting data or visualizing it?
*  Well, visualizing it might be some of the advice. People seem to learn a lot better
*  from visualization. I think, one thing I think a lot about as a journalist
*  is preferring simple models to more complicated
*  models. There are other versions of simple models. People can also
*  take it too far. But as a journalist, for example, to have something I can
*  say, this is a benchmark and I understand what it's doing
*  and I can explain what it's doing and I can also understand what the
*  limitations of it might be. And so I kind of know which direction
*  to lean relative to that baseline. I think it's more useful than a place
*  we just kind of say, well, we fed some data into a random number generator or
*  a magic machine and here's what it spit out. So for example,
*  I highly prefer, this is going off on attention, but I prefer regression-based modeling to
*  machine learning where you can't really explain anything. To me, the whole value is in
*  the explanation. But I do think, kind of likewise, people, when you kind of
*  explain and say, hey, we probably have the same interests here in mind to say,
*  this is actually pretty simple once you start peeling away the BS.
*  To me, that approach works a lot better in the long run than the approach
*  of saying, arguments from authority, well, this is rigorous and empirical and
*  objective. So therefore, believe the numbers, I think kind of explaining people why it's actually not
*  all that complicated and why you're making very defensible assumptions
*  how that leads you to an answer that might surprise them.
*  Frank Mannheim School of Policy. Could you put some numbers on the
*  criteria that the median voter would use in the United States
*  to elect major politicians like president, for example, emotions,
*  personal acquaintance, rational concepts,
*  information, and so on?
*  So the kind of classic political science answer is that people are deeply concerned about
*  the economy and that the economy might make up 50% of so
*  or of what people vote about. And there's room to dispute that. There's kind of esoteric critiques of maybe these
*  models are overfit, but leaving that aside from now.
*  I don't know. I mean, I guess one of the reasons why I was initially
*  skeptical about Trump is that America has a history of
*  not nominating candidates and electing candidates, rather, who are blatantly
*  unfit for office.
*  I have a softball follow-up question to that. Where in the state of Virginia,
*  to the best of my knowledge, you're the only person to have calculated correctly,
*  what is the chance if you are a voter in the state of Virginia that your vote will sway a presidential election?
*  Oh, it was pretty high. I think it was like, as an individual voter?
*  What's the chance that your vote in the state of Virginia will matter? If you don't remember, I do, but it's from your paper.
*  I mean, it's like 10% divided by 4 million or something?
*  It's one out of 10 million, the highest of any state.
*  So if you're going to vote anywhere, vote here. Next question.
*  Hi, Tyler O'Neill, a reporter with PJ Media. My question is, you mentioned how difficult it is
*  the weakness of empirical models when predicting presidential elections.
*  Is it possible to look at congressional elections, you know,
*  House of Representatives races, and draw more information and modeling from those?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think we would say that even though it's less kind of sexy to predict Senate races or
*  congressional races, that having larger, quasi-independent
*  samples is, that would be the better test ultimately.
*  Although even there, the error, so we saw in the Senate races last year how
*  the polls were off on average by three or four points, which is
*  pretty bad. It's happened before. But the problem is that all those errors were in the same
*  direction. So Republicans won a lot of races around the country that they were
*  underdogs in. Not huge underdogs, Virginia was almost a major upset.
*  But yeah, I mean, you know, it's a much kind of purer form of the
*  exercise to do data mining on congressional elections and weighing polls versus fundamentals
*  and whatever else. Next question.
*  Hi, my name is Harold Walbert. You mentioned some things like limited data, limited
*  observations, non-linearity, and things of that
*  nature that make traditional tools like statistics and econometrics difficult.
*  What are your thoughts on more computationally intensive methods like agent-based modeling for dealing with
*  these things like you mentioned herd behavior that make some of these analyses more difficult?
*  I mean, agent-based modeling is
*  interesting and there is some, if you can kind of simulate the underlying mechanisms,
*  this is how weather forecasting works by the way, is that weather forecasting
*  is not particularly statistically driven as we think of it. They actually are kind of creating a physical
*  model of the atmosphere which they're resolving mathematically.
*  So if you have reason to know exactly kind of how certain
*  people would behave and how they behave as a system, then agent-based modeling could give you insights
*  you couldn't get from regression analysis. On the other hand, if you're somewhat wrong about those assumptions,
*  then things could go kind of very haywire in a hurry.
*  You know, when I'm building models myself now, I spend a lot more time
*  kind of thinking about the edge cases, right? Say,
*  let's put some really weird inputs in here that are on the edge of plausible
*  and see how the model responds to those.
*  Maybe you have a function that's approximately linear but can't
*  be at the edge case. It would say that, for example, if you have a model saying that Hillary Clinton
*  will get 106% of the vote in Washington, D.C. or something against Trump,
*  I used to think, well, who really cares? She's going to win D.C. anyway.
*  She may. She may, right? You can vote twice in some parts of D.C.
*  But now that bothers me more.
*  So I'm trying to kind of think more about the correct functional form of a model
*  that would apply when the going gets weird because when the going gets weird is when things are interesting anyway.
*  We have four minutes left. Next question.
*  Hi, Richard. I'm an intern at the House of Representatives. Do you believe Facebook and Twitter,
*  where people create their own news feed, has led to possibly confirmation bias and has led to
*  people choosing more extreme views of political
*  ideology such as socialism, nationalism, Marxism?
*  Perhaps. I would also say that the kind of traditional two-dimensional political spectrum
*  is kind of a strange and contrived thing, too.
*  I mean, it's the result of a very messy process of coalition building
*  between parties. So, you know, I mentioned reasons to be pessimistic earlier.
*  A reason to be optimistic as a fan of democracy is that you are
*  seeing voice given to quirkier ideologies that are no less
*  intellectually coherent than the kind of Democratic versus Republican acts that we have
*  in the United States. But, you know, I kind of believe in the notion of a
*  filter bubble where people kind of surround themselves, where they're getting like information and not
*  confronting themselves with unpleasant facts necessarily. You saw that a lot
*  during the 2012 election where the polling was, I guess, a lot more straightforward
*  than it is this time around and people still were kind of cherry picking data to tell themselves that Romney
*  might win. You saw Democrats doing the reverse, by the way, in the 2014 midterms, more or less.
*  But, yeah, I mean, I, you know, as someone who's a critic
*  of media, I think the way people consume media is important and has
*  probably fairly large effects on our politics.
*  Last question. Hi, I'm Mike Blyley. I'm a law student here and I get my coverage of the
*  election exclusively from 538.
*  And I do that largely because of the unbiased nature, except for
*  Harry's unabashed love for Chris Christie. But, you know,
*  I noticed that specifically in your debate coverage, one of the things that you
*  all always mention is that the mainstream media's portrayal of the debate
*  matters more than anything else. When they say that someone wins,
*  that coverage carries. And then at the end of those pieces, you and your staff
*  put together grades for how the candidates did. And you may see where I'm going with this.
*  You strike me as someone who would rather predict rather than influence, but do you
*  see yourself playing into this zeitgeist where you could carry some weight in,
*  say, this election? I mean, that's why the primaries, although they're fun, are
*  a little tricky. Like, I think the general election people are fairly sensible and retreat to their corners,
*  but the primaries are so momentum driven that it's a little bit
*  weird. And I'm sure people do read what we say and so forth.
*  It's kind of not the type of influence that I want. At the same time,
*  you know, the fact is that all news coverage is influential.
*  And I think I would say at the very least, we promise some self
*  awareness, that we're aware that the way the events are covered by the press can affect
*  voters' views. Sometimes press can be surprised. It doesn't go the way they expect,
*  but you can have these big feedback loops. And I'm surprised
*  how difficult it is. I think one big edge we have, I'm glad that you read us,
*  right? But I think one big edge we have over, say,
*  the New York Times or something is that we can talk about the media as a political
*  actor. Now, we are the media too, and so I'm kind of aware of the circularity
*  of that. You know, frankly, I think one reason why
*  during the primaries, sometimes the conservative sites are more interested to read than liberal sites,
*  that they also start out being more suspicious of the media. Sometimes in ways
*  that I think are wrong, like about the polls in 2012, but I think
*  having that skepticism of seeing the media as a political actor
*  instead of a kind of benevolent umpire is to a first approximation
*  the right way to do things, and that's reflected in our coverage. You know, I guess sometimes at the
*  risk of being a little bit hypocritical potentially, but we do
*  try and be very transparent about what is what we think
*  is a fact, what's an opinion, what's an analysis,
*  you know, kind of what is a provocation. One reason why I like your blog is that
*  you have a lot of provocations, right? And they're clearly, sometimes you put the Tyrone label on it, but
*  it's clear what they are, right? It's clear that provocations are meant to incite discussion
*  and debate, and so we'll have a few of those too at times, but
*  speaking in the first person I think is important
*  and breaking from the kind of voice of God where a storm cloud gathered on
*  New Hampshire today, and the voters decided that speaking as
*  a subjective individual trying to understand what the objective world
*  is like is a lot of what we're all about. It's not for everyone, but I think that should be reflected at least
*  in the tone and approach of our coverage, even where we wind up getting things wrong in the end.
*  Here's Nate's book, read Nate's site. Nate, thank you for a great chat.
*  Thank you.
