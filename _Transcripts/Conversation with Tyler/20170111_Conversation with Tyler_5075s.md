# Jhumpa Lahiri on Writing, Translation, and Crossing Between Cultures | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [January 11, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY)
*  Thank you for coming. Now you've written a great deal about in some ways not having a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=0.0s)]
*  native country, not having a language of your own that's clearly yours or even a culture, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=9.52s)]
*  having read or reread all of your work and surrounding works. And if I think, you know, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=16.28s)]
*  how do I frame you? I would say I think of you as a Rhode Islander because that's where [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=21.44s)]
*  you grew up. You were born in England but came here when you were three, grew up in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=26.16s)]
*  Rhode Island. How would you react to that? Uncomfortably. I mean, no, with all due respect. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=29.2s)]
*  No, I mean, it's true. Well, first of all, thank you all very much for coming and for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=37.76s)]
*  your warm welcome. It is true that I lived there, well, let's see how long did I live [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=46.56s)]
*  there, from the age of three to 18, so 15 years. And you went to Barnard at 18, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=56.31999999999999s)]
*  I did. And so then I think I lived for as long in New York as I did in Rhode Island. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  But of course, one's childhood is one's childhood and is formative and in a way that later [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=72.64s)]
*  experiences are not. So yes, I mean, it is a part of who I am, absolutely. But I don't feel, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=83.92s)]
*  I mean, I've always had a very uneasy relationship with the place. And, you know, you mentioned the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  essay in State by State, one of these books that have been kindly assembled here, such a lovely [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=104.48s)]
*  display, really, I'm so touched. But I was asked to write about Rhode Island in this anthology [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=111.6s)]
*  called State by State, which invited a number of authors to write about their home state or a state [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=120.16s)]
*  with, you know, that they had some sort of connection to in any case. And so I chose Rhode [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  Island. I mean, I was asked to write about Rhode Island. I said yes, but partly it was to get over [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=136.16s)]
*  this sense of discomfort about your very opening. Did it work? Well, I mean, I think what was helpful [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=143.68s)]
*  about it is that it opened up the setting of the lowland, which is set, you know, in part in Rhode [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=153.44s)]
*  Island. But it's the first of my books in which I can actually mention Rhode Island by its name, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=168.4s)]
*  whereas the other books, the preceding books, are set in these sort of, you know, fake Rhode Island [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=175.04s)]
*  slash Massachusetts kind of, you know, this area, this terrain, that it really is Rhode Island, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=184.64s)]
*  you know, just to boil it down. But I couldn't mention it. I couldn't name it as such. And I [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=193.44s)]
*  think that's telling. It was saying something. The fact that in the earlier books, I was, you know, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=200.32s)]
*  I was writing about the ocean. I was writing about this kind of, you know, small campus little town [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=206.72s)]
*  and describing these settings that I knew very well, the settings I had grown up in. But I couldn't [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=213.44s)]
*  come out and say that it was Rhode Island, and I kept calling it some suburb of Boston. And, you [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  know, so I think the writing of that piece unlocked something. And then in the lowland, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=227.84s)]
*  they're in Rhode Island, and I don't pretend anymore. We'll get to your most recent work. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=235.36s)]
*  But one of the things I like the most about everything you've done is I always get the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=240.8s)]
*  sense you're trying to work out some problem for yourself and also for us. But I'd like to survey [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=245.2s)]
*  your whole writing life and just start with the question when you were young. When you were, say, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=251.84s)]
*  15 years old, what was your favorite novel and why? Well, I think I had started reading [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=256.0s)]
*  Russian literature around that age. I had some friends. My family had friends with some, you know, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=263.68s)]
*  one of the daughters. They had three daughters. One of them was a little bit older. She was already [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=274.4s)]
*  in college. And so when I would visit them, I would see these big volumes of Dostoyevsky and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=279.12s)]
*  Tolstoy on her desk, these Norton critical editions. They were really appealing to me. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=285.6s)]
*  And so I think I tried to kind of, you know, rise to another level of reading. And so that's my, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=293.12s)]
*  that's probably what I was, you know, reading a lot of. I loved Hawthorne even then. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=309.12s)]
*  So I was in 10th grade when I was 15. I read The Great Gatsby that year. And then the following [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=317.76s)]
*  year, I was introduced to Hardy, who has become so important to me as well. So it was in high [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=326.32s)]
*  school that I encountered, fortunately, certain authors who have stayed with me [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=333.52s)]
*  for all of this time and who continue to inspire me. One of the things I've liked about, just [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  comments you've dropped, is the way you read, say, Scarlet Letter is actually a novel of immigrants [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=345.84s)]
*  that maybe the characters wouldn't have behaved that way in a quote unquote home country. Even [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=352.08s)]
*  a lot of Hardy, especially Tess, a favorite of yours, you can read as a kind of immigrant novel [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=357.84s)]
*  coming from the countryside, moving somewhere quite strange. And to use that as a lens for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=362.48s)]
*  interpreting what otherwise might seem like strange character behaviors, but reading them through you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=367.76s)]
*  is actually very rewarding. So through your eyes, through your fiction. Does that make sense to you [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  at all? Yes. I mean, I think what I'm responding to is a sense of displacement in those authors, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=379.92s)]
*  in almost any author. I mean, even, you know, Willa Cather, you can read this way. Homer, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=385.92s)]
*  you can read this way. So many authors, you can read this way, which is why I think some years ago, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=391.52s)]
*  I was asked this question by the New York Times Book Review about, you know, what was my problem [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  with immigrant literature? And I made a kind of maybe cheeky remark about how I didn't believe [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=402.32s)]
*  in it. But this is, it wasn't being cheeky. It was just being, it was just saying what I felt was [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  true, which is that this is something I've responded to in literature from the very beginning. And if I [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=413.84s)]
*  didn't have this response to literature, then, you know, these writers wouldn't have fed and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=418.96s)]
*  inspired me the way they did, because there would have been a quote unquote barrier between their [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=425.84s)]
*  experiences and their times and mine. And that shouldn't be the case, right? That's not what [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=430.64s)]
*  literature does. Literature does the opposite. And it allows us to cross over those boundaries [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=436.32s)]
*  in a beautiful way, in a magical way. Now, if I can trust the internet, you have three masters [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=442.0s)]
*  degrees in creative writing, comparative literature, and English. And for one of your [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=447.84s)]
*  degrees, you translated six Bengali short stories by Ashapurna Devi, who's a Bengali writer, maybe [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=453.11999999999995s)]
*  the most famous woman writer or even writer in Bengal for much of the 20th century. What connects [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=460.0s)]
*  you to her and to what problem were you trying to solve by engaging in her work? Well, I knew about [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  her through my mother, who's a devoted reader of Ashapurna Devi's work and talked about her a lot. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=474.72s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting, you know, I mean, my mother read a lot, but she didn't really read [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  in English very much at all. I mean, but she read in Bengali. And I remember the effort of, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=490.0s)]
*  you know, going to Calcutta, ordering the books. My mother, the list she would give my uncle [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=496.8s)]
*  who had the connections with all the booksellers on College Street in Calcutta, which is like the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=504.8s)]
*  book kind of district, and the drama of this, you know, going and ordering all the books from [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=510.16s)]
*  the publishers and waiting and bringing them back, you know, in the brick shop, piling them, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=517.76s)]
*  the whole thing, and then bringing them back to the United States. You know, I saw what it meant to her. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=522.08s)]
*  You know, and I saw, I mean, as with everything with trying to get the right ingredients, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=528.4s)]
*  what have you, but the literature was, you know, I could see that those books simply weren't [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=535.28s)]
*  available here. And they were in some sense, you know, her lifeline. Anyway, so she would talk about [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=540.8s)]
*  these, she would talk about the work of this particular author, among others, and I was struck [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=550.4s)]
*  by the things she described, you know, a very prolific author of short stories and novels, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=559.28s)]
*  of some very incisive short stories about kind of domestic life, and sort of classified unfairly, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=565.28s)]
*  I think, as a writer for women, which I don't think she is at all. I think she has a much, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=576.96s)]
*  you know, more universal power and vision. Anyway, in graduate school, I was taking this [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=582.72s)]
*  translation workshop, and so the assignment, at some point I was asked to translate something, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=590.08s)]
*  and I thought, well, what can I do here? And, you know, I had studied Latin and Ancient Greek a little bit, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=600.8s)]
*  and I had some French, and then I had Bengali as my, you know, first language. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  But you didn't read Bengali characters. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  I couldn't read it, and I still really can't, and I couldn't write in it either, and I still really can't. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=625.44s)]
*  And yet, I worked around this obvious obstacle, and I asked my mother to read [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=636.1600000000001s)]
*  a number of these stories out loud, and I taped her. And then I listened to them, and, you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=646.4000000000001s)]
*  kept playing them back, playing them back, and I translated in this way. And I can read enough, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=654.24s)]
*  I mean, painstakingly, slowly, but I can, I have, you know, it's not completely incomprehensible to me, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=663.36s)]
*  so that I could then also go back, in addition to the tapes, that, you know, I could also look at [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=670.24s)]
*  the text and sort of see how things were structured, where the breaks were, etc., etc. And I even caught [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=676.4s)]
*  my mother a couple of times. She kind of skipped, you know, a paragraph here and there, and I would [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=685.28s)]
*  call her up and say, what about this part where she's describing, you know. So it was a really [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=690.24s)]
*  interesting project, and I, but that's how it, that's how it started. There's something about [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  how she sets her stories in architectural space, always, that reminds me of your writings. When you [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=703.76s)]
*  have a scene, you describe a home very often, or the place in advance, and that's imposing a structure [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=710.56s)]
*  on the scene, and that's in her. Do you get that from her? Well, I think I wrote the, in the commentary, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=717.52s)]
*  I wrote to the thesis, if I'm not mistaken. I mean, this was a lifetime ago, but I think that was part [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=725.28s)]
*  of the lens I brought to my reading, to my critical reading of the stories, was that she was a writer [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=732.16s)]
*  very attuned to space, to physical space. And so I must have been affected by this in some sense, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=739.68s)]
*  and then my doctoral dissertation kind of built on this in that I wrote about [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  Jacobian English drama and where it was set, specifically often in a corrupt Italian palazzo, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  and so what that meant. So I think as a reader of literature, when I was a student of literature, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  I was very attuned to where things were set and why, and what it meant, you know, to have that, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=772.8s)]
*  that literal architecture being an element of narrative. Now we're at George Mason University, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=783.76s)]
*  and George Mason, the man, he lived in a place called Gunston Hall, and that's one of the best [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=791.12s)]
*  known examples of Palladian architecture in Virginia, even the whole Atlantic seaboard. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=795.92s)]
*  So you did a PhD dissertation on Renaissance studies, and what is it about Palladianism [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=801.52s)]
*  and Palladio that drew your attention? What's the magnet there for you? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, some things just, you know, now that you ask me, I'm thinking, okay, so what led me to [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=813.68s)]
*  this. One of the classes, again, that I was taking as a graduate student was a class, a seminar. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=820.88s)]
*  It was sort of a broad seminar with lots of different professors. Anyway, so I, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=835.76s)]
*  there was this one professor named Roger Scruton who writes a lot about architecture. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=839.6s)]
*  I had a debate with him once on nature friendship. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=845.6s)]
*  Yes, he's very- [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=847.9200000000001s)]
*  I won. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=850.08s)]
*  Congratulations. Yeah, I mean, he's a very well-spoken man, and with a broad range of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=852.16s)]
*  interests, aesthetics, philosophy, architecture. Anyway, and he taught part of this class [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=860.32s)]
*  and talked about the language of architecture, Italian architecture in particular, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=870.96s)]
*  and I was, I just was really struck by the class, the idea of it, looking at space [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=878.0s)]
*  so carefully, these beautiful spaces, what they meant, the vocabulary implicit in architecture. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=884.64s)]
*  So that was sort of step one, and then I went to Florence in this time. I went to Italy for [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  the first time. I went to Florence with the, you know, and not only did it lead to this whole other [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=900.0s)]
*  sort of phase of my life, Italian, writing in Italian, but it was, I went with a special eye, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=905.52s)]
*  toured the architecture looking at the places that I was seeing in slides, you know, as a grad [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=912.64s)]
*  student in Boston and connecting to them for the first time, really experiencing those spaces for [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=919.04s)]
*  the first time. And then when I came, you know, then when I was reading these plays, when I was [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=925.36s)]
*  always interested in where Shakespeare set his plays, I was interested in his use of Italy as [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=932.96s)]
*  a setting, and then that just sort of got me started thinking about what was the relationship of, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=939.28s)]
*  you know, in Renaissance England, you know, what was it all about, and what did Italy represent [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=946.16s)]
*  to England and to English artists, dramatists, and what was this choice all about? Why were they [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=954.3199999999999s)]
*  setting clearly kind of English political drama on foreign soil and what that meant? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=961.04s)]
*  And they're also afraid of Italy, right? It's a symbol of corruption. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  It's a sort of a horror, love-horror kind of love-hate, you know, attraction-repulsion, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=972.24s)]
*  contradictory, you know, attitude, which I tried to unpack a little bit in the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=978.8s)]
*  course of the dissertation. So it's still working through some set of related problems in a way. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=988.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I think one thing that's always sort of in there is this idea of translation [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=994.48s)]
*  and bringing back and crossing over, you know. I mean, one thing certainly that was happening [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=999.52s)]
*  in the Renaissance was that these, you know, people were literally traveling to Venice, to Florence, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1006.4s)]
*  to Rome, and seeing this architecture which is sort of, you know, born from that place and then [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1013.04s)]
*  bringing those ideas back, translating the works of, you know, Vitruvius or Alberti or whomever, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1021.12s)]
*  and then using those ideas to build, literally to build buildings in England. And then from there, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1029.84s)]
*  we have things here in the United States. So that also interested me. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1037.6s)]
*  To continue the whirlwind tour of your career, in preparing for this, I re-read Interpreter of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1042.64s)]
*  Maladies. And this was the sense I had this time around, that one of your characters, Mr. Capasi, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1048.0s)]
*  who is the interpreter of maladies. So if people come to the doctor and they only speak Gujarati, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1055.28s)]
*  he's able to translate that for the doctor and explain what the symptoms are. That in a sense, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1060.64s)]
*  in the book, you view yourself, the author, as the interpreter of maladies. So people who are [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1065.92s)]
*  disconnected in different ways. And you're the one doing the interpreting, and he's at the center [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1071.28s)]
*  of the book, and he's a stand-in for you. Is that just my imagination? Probably not. But I don't [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1076.56s)]
*  think I was aware of it at the time, you know. I mean, I think just yesterday, I was talking in [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1084.0s)]
*  Princeton at a place called Dorotea's House, which is sort of dedicated to Italian-American culture, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1094.32s)]
*  so on. And you were talking about the most recent book, and talking about, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1101.36s)]
*  at one point I was talking about this idea of, you know, in antiquity, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1109.52s)]
*  in Latin, the word for translator is interpreter. And I teach translation now. And, you know, I talk [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1116.48s)]
*  a lot to my students about translation being the most intimate form of reading, and how there was [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1126.96s)]
*  the time when translating and interpreting and analyzing sort of were all one thing. And now [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1134.24s)]
*  there are translators, and then there are people who look at books and analyze them, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1142.8s)]
*  and there are scholars, and etc. And it's not necessarily, you know, the same activity. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  And it strikes me, because now many years, I mean, so I wrote Interpreter of Maladies. That was my [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1153.6s)]
*  first book. I called it that. I heard the title in this strange, you know, flash. And now years [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1158.3999999999999s)]
*  later, years have gone by, and I have, I'm now just setting out on a new phase of my creative life [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1167.84s)]
*  as a translator. And so I think it's all one continuum, but I just wasn't, one can't see, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1176.32s)]
*  one can't realize these things in the moment. You know, you have to, it's only looking back that you [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1184.0s)]
*  kind of see certain patterns. Another thing that struck me about this book was how much it had in [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1189.12s)]
*  common with Elena Ferrante in some ways. And of course, this is at a time when you wouldn't have [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1195.6s)]
*  read her yet, but this notion of both feeling a need to set everything right for so many different [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1200.56s)]
*  people and being unable to, and that carrying a kind of sadness, and then interjected into the [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1206.32s)]
*  story always are books. So books both have this immense power, like everyone's reading them, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1213.1999999999998s)]
*  everyone's looking to them for answers. And yet at the same time, books are somehow impotent, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  because they don't actually allow anyone to actually set everything right for parents or [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1223.76s)]
*  other sets of people. And she has a bit of that, and you have a bit of that, and of course it's [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1229.12s)]
*  completely independent, but your later fascination with her seems already to be an interpreter of [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1234.8s)]
*  maladies in some ways. Does that make sense to you? Well, I certainly recognize that in her work when [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1241.12s)]
*  I read her, and I wrote to her, I wrote some letters, I wrote two letters to her that were [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1246.88s)]
*  sort of public letters that I read in Rome some years ago in public, and maybe she was there, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1254.16s)]
*  or maybe she wasn't. In any case, she did write back to me, and I talked precisely about this. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1265.1200000000001s)]
*  I talked about how she uses, how books are characters in her work, and I think her work [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1273.68s)]
*  in some sense is about reading and about language and literature and what it means on a very deep [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1287.2s)]
*  level, a very sophisticated level. I don't think my work is doing that at all, but I think about [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1294.64s)]
*  it a lot. And so I was very struck by that element of her work and this focus on characters who write, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1303.04s)]
*  characters who become writers, how books shape and form us on the one hand and how they [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1318.0s)]
*  betray us on the other hand and can't really contain what life is, this sort of contradiction at heart. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1328.24s)]
*  Now if you compare interpreter of maladies to your other short story collection, Unaccustomed Earth, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1337.1999999999998s)]
*  do you think of the latter, more recent work, as being more about reconciliation and this greater [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1343.6s)]
*  role for children or families in at least some of the stories, or do you think overall your fiction [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1348.8799999999999s)]
*  with time is moving in the direction of Hardy and becoming darker? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1356.3200000000002s)]
*  I think it's becoming darker, and I think that's usually the case as we get older, right? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1363.92s)]
*  So I think that, and that's my sense, and I feel that, you know, though I really try not to [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1373.92s)]
*  read a lot about what people say about my work, I also don't live in a vacuum in outer space, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  and so I sense reactions to certain things, right? And I think, as the years have gone by [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1394.48s)]
*  and the books have evolved, the vision has become a little less forgiving, less tolerant, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1404.72s)]
*  a little less bitter sweet and more just maybe bitter, and you know, and that's fine. I mean, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1416.3200000000002s)]
*  you know, I remember even with the lowland, you know, and I don't think my editor would [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1430.8000000000002s)]
*  think my editor would mind if I shared this with you, but at one point she said, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1439.4399999999998s)]
*  well, it's just really grim sometimes, you know, what goes on, and we share a love of Hardy, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1444.7199999999998s)]
*  and I just said, would you really have said that to Hardy? And she didn't say anything else, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1454.08s)]
*  you know, but, and so I published the book I wanted to publish, but a lot of people have said [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1462.24s)]
*  to me, I just couldn't read the book, you know, it was just too heavy, too dark, too whatever, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1469.44s)]
*  whatever, and they miss, they miss, I think, the sort of bittersweet quality of, say, a novel like [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1475.84s)]
*  The Namesake. You bring up lowland. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Bengal. If someone's [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1484.8s)]
*  visiting India and they ask me for advice, I say you simply absolutely must go to Calcutta. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1490.56s)]
*  To the extent you feel the same way, how would you articulate why it is people ought to go visit [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1498.8s)]
*  Calcutta? Because it's one of the most fascinating places on earth that is, you know, I mean, it's [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  just a city that is like no other with a, you know, a life, a cultural life, a history, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1514.64s)]
*  utterly its own and hard and beautiful. I mean, its beauty is not what one, you know, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  sort of conventional, you know, people say, oh, well, is it a beautiful city? Well, no, I mean, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1538.48s)]
*  yes, parts of it can be, yes, of course, but not in that conventional sense, and it's challenging [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1543.36s)]
*  on a whole host of levels. And I, of course, you know, I don't know it as a tourist, right, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1553.6s)]
*  because my family's from there and I've never known it in any other way other than when I was [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1559.04s)]
*  very young where my grandparents lived and then my aunts and uncles, my cousins, and so forth. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1565.36s)]
*  So I have my own relationship to it. But, you know, it's like not knowing New York City [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1570.4s)]
*  in the American context. I mean, it's just its own thing and it's so strong in its flavor and its [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1586.5600000000002s)]
*  power and its energy. So, you know, it has to be reckoned with, you know, I think. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1593.6s)]
*  And if I think of Indian economists, the two are the best known would be Amartya Sen and [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1605.84s)]
*  Abhijit Banerjee, and they're both Bengali, of course. Why does it seem that so much of [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1611.36s)]
*  the Indian intelligentsia comes from Calcutta or Bengal? What is it in the water, so to speak? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1616.56s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I just, I know that they're, I mean, I hate to make these kind of sweeping [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1623.6s)]
*  general, these generalized comments. I don't believe in them. But, you know, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1635.36s)]
*  it's a city that believes in its poets, that believes in its politics, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1643.12s)]
*  believes in its, believes in humanity in some sense. And life is so extreme there [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1651.68s)]
*  in so many ways. People are put to the test and you see life being put to the test constantly [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1663.5200000000002s)]
*  around you. And there's nothing you can really accept, you know, easily or take for granted [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1670.72s)]
*  about yourself or about the universe if you've been there. You know, I mean, it just, it's a jolt [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1678.0s)]
*  to your consciousness. But a fundamental one, an essential one, you know, to shake us out of this, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1685.2s)]
*  whatever takes over if you protect yourself. Now, if I were to take a superficial reading of [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1693.92s)]
*  Indian history, earlier Calcutta is the central capital for the British Empire in India. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1700.56s)]
*  And you could argue that as the British left India since World War II, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1706.88s)]
*  Calcutta has become significantly less central in some ways. Delhi and Mumbai seem to become [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1711.52s)]
*  more important. A, do you think that's true? And B, if it is true, do you think that actually in part [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1717.2s)]
*  accounts for why Calcutta has stayed so interesting? That loss of centrality or existing on the margins, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1723.28s)]
*  you even have a nice Italian word for this? Well, I think it's retained a certain character that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1729.44s)]
*  the other big cities, you know, have a more kind of western overlay at this point, you know. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1740.72s)]
*  I mean, Calcutta is not far behind and it's changed radically from, you know, the city I knew when I [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1751.2s)]
*  was a young girl. And now I think with, you know, developments, globalization, what have you, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1758.88s)]
*  you know, you have lots of development and all the five-store hotels you could ever want and all the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1768.96s)]
*  companies and banks and things and fancy roads and, you know, all of that stuff that back in the 70s, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1775.6000000000001s)]
*  Calcutta didn't have those things and then the airport was, you know, distinctly not glamorous [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1783.4399999999998s)]
*  and all of these things, you know, so you felt, you know, okay, this is a different kind of experience, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1789.4399999999998s)]
*  not designed for the tourists, not designed for the important person, you know, shall we say. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1797.04s)]
*  But, and so now, so that has already changed and that distance is smaller, significantly smaller, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1804.8s)]
*  but in some sense, you know, yes, I think it still retains its own particular flavor and energy [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1814.16s)]
*  because of this, maybe. And how emotionally tied do you feel to the earlier history? So in 1905, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1822.96s)]
*  Curzon partitions what is now West Bengal, Bengal from what is now Bangladesh and you can easily [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1828.88s)]
*  imagine some alternate history where that hadn't happened and the way the national borders would [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1836.4s)]
*  have been divvied up would be quite different from what we see. Is that just abstract history to you, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1842.72s)]
*  the way, you know, I might read about the English Renaissance or is that something that has emotional [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1848.4s)]
*  oomph in your mind, in your heart and you feel somehow torn as a Bengali that you've been separated [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1854.56s)]
*  from other Bengalis in some way or is it just not part of your connection to West Bengal? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1862.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's interesting and my relationship with Indian history is kind of in these two [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1870.56s)]
*  categories. In some sense, I mean, in some sense, you know, I didn't study any of it [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1878.72s)]
*  because I was raised here, right, and so India just wasn't on any map anywhere ever. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1884.56s)]
*  And so there was that, you know, there was a sort of formal separation as a child growing up in this [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1892.72s)]
*  country when I was growing up. On the other hand, you know, I come from my family and I, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1901.52s)]
*  because we would go back to Calcutta quite often and because my family and their friends, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1910.24s)]
*  you know, talked a lot about their country, their city, history, events. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1918.1599999999999s)]
*  So I was always aware at the same time of these incredibly traumatic events in Indian history and [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1924.64s)]
*  the partition, most of all, what that meant particularly for my father's family, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1935.04s)]
*  the neighborhood that my father grew up in, which I describe in the lowland a little bit. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1944.88s)]
*  I, you know, I was, I asked my parents when I was a young girl, you know, we, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1951.76s)]
*  one of the stories in Interpreted Malady is called When Mr. Pirsada Comes to Dine, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1963.6s)]
*  comes from a kind of vague memory of a man from Bangladesh, a scholar who was living in [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  Rhode Island in the 1970s during that civil war and my curiosity about who he was and why he was [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1976.0s)]
*  there and stories my parents told me. And then as I grew older, as I became more of a conscious, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1982.4s)]
*  you know, person, teenager, wondering about things, going back to India, you know, I was [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1991.6s)]
*  slowly starting to fill in sort of pieces like, okay, so this is what happened and it happened [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=1998.32s)]
*  at this time and then this and this is what, you know, this meant this wave of people came and [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2004.1599999999999s)]
*  all of these people, you know, lived this thing. But on top of that, there's the residue, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2008.32s)]
*  there's the emotional residue of what it's meant for certain people, either in my family or people [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2017.76s)]
*  that my family knows who remain deeply scarred by those events and not only deeply scarred but [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2024.96s)]
*  actively hostile, resentful toward, you know, for the case of my family, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2036.24s)]
*  toward East Bengal and Muslims, for example. And so this was something that I, you know, I took in [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2044.56s)]
*  and I still take in. And that uneasy relationship between Hindus and Muslims [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2054.2400000000002s)]
*  in Bengali culture, right, is still very alive today. And, you know, my daughter, her name is [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2062.32s)]
*  Nur, which is a Persian name, but, you know, there were people in my family who commented [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2075.68s)]
*  on that choice of name, thinking, well, you know, what does she think she's doing? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2085.44s)]
*  Because it's Persian. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2090.8799999999997s)]
*  Because it's associated with Muslims and etc., etc., and this kind of hatred, intolerance, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2091.8399999999997s)]
*  prejudice, you know, that is what I'm saying is it's still, it's something that's still very much [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2097.2799999999997s)]
*  in my family's kitchen, in their dinner table. I mean, my parents are not like that at all, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2103.04s)]
*  right, and they taught me to have, you know, to be free of these kinds of [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2108.96s)]
*  attitudes. But, you know, perhaps that's easier for me to say because I didn't experience the [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2117.04s)]
*  trauma of losing, my family losing their ancestral property, for example, you know, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2124.8799999999997s)]
*  which some of their friends experienced and therefore even now in 2016, they're still, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2130.08s)]
*  you know, saying, oh, but, you know, this horrible thing happened and, you know, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2137.7599999999998s)]
*  we're still upset about it. So. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2142.56s)]
*  What's your literary or maybe even also emotional relationship with the works of Tagore? So he's a [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2145.52s)]
*  towering giant in Bengali intellectual history. In your stories every now and then, someone's [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2151.52s)]
*  reading his poems. There's a lot of themes from him that are in your work, like home and the world, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2157.28s)]
*  this odd mix of tensions between the cosmopolitan in the particular. He was even interested in book [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2164.32s)]
*  design. He was a kind of polymath. He studied many things, worked in different forms. Is that [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2169.6000000000004s)]
*  just parallel or an influence or? Well, I mean, I think if you're Bengali, you just, he's like a [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2175.92s)]
*  member of your family in some sense, you know, I mean, he's a god. He's, you know, in this pantheon [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2185.12s)]
*  like place, right? He's not a god person. But, you know, for people, I mean, my parents, again, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2192.56s)]
*  they aren't religious people, so they didn't give us a religious education, but they certainly [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2204.24s)]
*  taught us to respect the great minds and the great visionaries. And so Tagore is one of those, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2211.6s)]
*  right? And the fact that he happens to be Bengali won the Nobel Prize, well, you know, details. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2218.88s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, my grandfather was a painter. My uncle was a painter. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2227.12s)]
*  I grew up with portraits of Tagore all over our house. I have a portrait of him. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2235.92s)]
*  In my house, painted by a watercolor by my uncle, I have a beautiful photograph my mother dug up [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2241.84s)]
*  recently of, so my grandfather's brother was a press photographer and he took the last, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2249.76s)]
*  he took a picture of Tagore at his last public, you know, last time he spoke in public. And so [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2258.96s)]
*  I have this photograph that's just next to me when I'm writing. So I feel this kind of, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2265.92s)]
*  you know, this constant presence, shall we say. Again, my limitation in not really being a [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2272.4s)]
*  fluent reader of Bengali is, you know, it creates a situation. It does. I mean, I've read him in [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2282.7200000000003s)]
*  mostly in translation. I've read fiction. I've read poetry. I grew up hearing all of the songs [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2289.92s)]
*  like 24 hours a day in my house. So, you know, but I don't, I'm not aware of any kind of conscious [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2295.36s)]
*  influence, if that's what you're asking. But again, what's conscious, what's unconscious. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2306.32s)]
*  Now let's move to maybe what's my favorite book of yours. In other words, which I take to be your [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2311.6s)]
*  memoir of learning to engage with both reading Italian, dealing with Italian culture, and most [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2316.48s)]
*  of all writing in Italian, a remarkably brave thing to do. And it comes off extremely well. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2322.56s)]
*  I'm just going to toss out the names of a few Italian writers, the lesser known ones. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2328.88s)]
*  And if you have a connection to them, tell us why you think they're interesting or how they've [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2334.0s)]
*  shaped you in some way. Feel free to pass on any one, of course. Lala Romano. Okay. Well, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2337.6s)]
*  I had never heard of her until I was living in Rome. And I just was reading the paper one day [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2347.28s)]
*  and read an article about her. And it was interesting. I took a note. I took note of it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2356.32s)]
*  I took note of the name. And I went to the bookshop. And I said, I'd like to read this author. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2368.0s)]
*  And they said, oh, yeah, she's sort of hard to find, you know, kind of not that well distributed. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2374.24s)]
*  Anyway, so I ordered some books. And in fact, what I did, because it was so hard to find the books, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2381.12s)]
*  I went through the person who wrote, this is Italy, right? Everybody knows everybody. So the person [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2395.7599999999998s)]
*  who wrote the article, I knew. So I said, you know, how do I get these books? And he said, well, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2400.72s)]
*  what you need to do is you need to write to her husband who has all the books. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2408.24s)]
*  You know, he has like a warehouse in his, in their house. I said, okay. So I wrote the husband. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2413.52s)]
*  And so there was some back and forth. And then he sent me [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2422.0s)]
*  a packet of books from Milano, from Milan. And they never made it to Rome. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2425.28s)]
*  You know, happens. They're still on a train somewhere. Yes. So I waited. I waited for these books. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2432.08s)]
*  And they weren't coming. And then I said, listen, these books, I know you kindly sent them. But, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2438.32s)]
*  but, and then one thing led to another. And I was, I found myself in Milan. And again, I kind of [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2443.44s)]
*  reignited this interest. And he said, well, why don't you come over? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2456.08s)]
*  And then I went to her house. And I saw her house where she used to live. And we had a, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2464.4s)]
*  you know, very interesting conversation. I saw her desk. I saw her things. I saw her paintings. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2470.88s)]
*  And he gave me all of her books, like, you know, like a cart full of her books. And that was really [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2480.6400000000003s)]
*  exciting. But no, so I, and anyway, so I started reading her with great interest. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2487.76s)]
*  She's an incredibly sort of modernist writer in some sense. Her language is incredible, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2494.0800000000004s)]
*  essential in its quality. She wrote an extraordinarily powerful book that I, you know, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2502.88s)]
*  if there's, you know, life is long enough, and there's time, I would like to translate [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  called Neymari Estremi. And it's a sort of two part [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2518.56s)]
*  memoir of her, of losing her husband. And, you know, there's so many books now about grief and [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2527.52s)]
*  the loss of a loved one and what that means. But this was something that was written a long time [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2534.0s)]
*  ago before all these books became kind of part of our culture. So that's an amazing book of her. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2539.92s)]
*  She wrote a lot of interesting, very interesting novels. She, she wrote about homecomings to places [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2547.44s)]
*  that don't exist anymore. She did. And then one of the things that also really struck me [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2552.64s)]
*  was at the end of her life, she was almost blind. And, and still the drive to write was [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2560.96s)]
*  so intense and constant. And so her husband, her second husband, you know, the one who survives her [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2571.92s)]
*  was, you know, was explaining that when, when she was in the final phase of her life [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  and could barely see she would, you know, she had these enormous pieces of paper, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2585.2s)]
*  basically, and, and would just sort of write a couple of words, a sentence or two a day, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2589.6s)]
*  like this, and these very kind of, kind of the words were just burning with, with life and, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2596.08s)]
*  and with her need to express herself in spite of the, the, the disability. And, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2604.08s)]
*  and these, these writings were collected in, in a book called The Last Diary, which I read. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2610.56s)]
*  And there's a one of her, they're almost like little, you know, fragments, epigrams, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2618.88s)]
*  some of these little entries. And one of them says, in Italian, it says, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2625.76s)]
*  la mia ceccita è un punto di vista, which means my blindness is a point of view. And, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2631.52s)]
*  and I was really, I really marveled at that because I felt like it kind of explained, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2639.6800000000003s)]
*  at least to me, the purpose of writing in Italian, because of course, she wasn't totally blind, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2646.7200000000003s)]
*  she was partially blind. And, and I'm not totally blind in Italian either, but I feel kind of [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2654.4s)]
*  partially blind. Now, I don't want to compare myself to her because she had actually a physical, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2661.5200000000004s)]
*  you know, issue with her eyesight, and she would, didn't choose that for herself. And she suffered [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  for it, whereas my project is something that comes from me, and it's voluntary. But it is [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2673.6s)]
*  this kind of voluntary blindness, right? But it's richer for you to read in Italian, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2679.8399999999997s)]
*  and maybe even sometimes to write in Italian now, because the partial blindness gives you a new [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2685.2s)]
*  lens on all these problems you've been trying to come to terms with. Well, it makes you look harder. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2690.72s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Another writer, Cesare Pavese. Well, Pavese is huge, you know, he translated Moby Dick. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2695.52s)]
*  And my, we were in Sicily a couple of years ago, and the, we were sailing around the Aeolian [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2707.36s)]
*  Islands, and we had this long conversation one day with our skipper about how, according to him, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2715.68s)]
*  Pavese's translation of Moby Dick surpasses the work of Melville. And does it? Well, you know, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2722.8s)]
*  I actually haven't read it yet, and I would like to. I keep meaning to pick it up when I'm over there. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2729.76s)]
*  But he was, you know, a colossal writer from Turin, that great literary city, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2737.04s)]
*  where you have Primo Levi, Natalia Ginzburg, Einaudi, the publishing house, you know, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2745.68s)]
*  all concentrated in this part of Italy in the north over toward France. And Pavese wrote very [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2754.72s)]
*  much in the autobiographical vein, and did things that, you know, again, I think now it's, oh, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2763.6s)]
*  it's fashionable when the writer becomes a character, and oh, we all write about ourselves, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2774.1600000000003s)]
*  and there's a lot of memoir and things. But these are things that he was doing, you know, in, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2779.0400000000004s)]
*  after World War II. You know, he had a tragic life, he suffered deeply, he committed suicide, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2785.28s)]
*  and he left behind an incredible sort of writer's notebook [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2792.48s)]
*  that is an extraordinarily powerful work, you know, very, very dark, very, very true, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2801.6s)]
*  and wrote lots of short stories, as well as, you know, a series of kind of slim novels. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2812.96s)]
*  And he worked really hard as a translator, not only his own translations of many American authors, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2820.7999999999997s)]
*  had a very rich relationship with the English language, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2830.64s)]
*  but also sort of oversaw a lot of translation projects. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2836.3199999999997s)]
*  He writes like an American writer in some ways. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2841.44s)]
*  Well, he was influenced. I mean, this is what's interesting. He was influenced by [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2843.44s)]
*  reading and translating Melville, among others, and his Italian has a different energy as a result [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2846.88s)]
*  of that translation, and I think those translations and his relationship with English, and I think [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2857.76s)]
*  this is what's kind of missing in American literature right now, in some sense. I mean, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2864.2400000000002s)]
*  I feel like, with the exception of poets, American poets who have, you know, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2868.48s)]
*  devoted time and energy to other literatures, to translation, whether it's Ezra Pound or other poets, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2877.2000000000003s)]
*  L.B.S. Merman, Mark Strand, I mean, you have examples of people who translate and make that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2883.84s)]
*  part of their creative work, but relatively very few fiction writers stop to think about it [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2889.2000000000003s)]
*  or engage with it, you know, and so, but I think my, you know, knowledge now of Italian writers [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2899.84s)]
*  has opened up something because I think, you know, for me, I mean, I just finished translating my [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2915.12s)]
*  first novel from Italian, and it has been such a formative experience for me and [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2919.2000000000003s)]
*  powerful and just deepened my awareness of what words are and literature and language and all of [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2925.76s)]
*  that. It's just been, I kind of can't believe it's taken me this long, you know, but I'm excited, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2934.5600000000004s)]
*  but I think someone like Pavese was like, you know, blazed the way in some sense. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2942.5600000000004s)]
*  One of my wishes is that you someday give us a book on Italian fiction, and here's a writer, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2948.5600000000004s)]
*  not Italian, but writing in another language, not the mother tongue, Agata Kristof. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2953.2s)]
*  Yes, amazing. What's important? You have her book there. Yes. Well, she is- And that's a trilogy, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2959.6s)]
*  right? Yeah, she wrote this trilogy and she wrote some other books too. So she was Hungarian [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2966.48s)]
*  and left during the invasion to- fled to Switzerland with her small kids, her husband, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2973.6s)]
*  and her dictionaries and writes about this in an amazing little book called The Illiterate, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2983.2s)]
*  an alphabeta. I read it in Italian. It must be called something else in French, an alphabet, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2991.2s)]
*  but she taught herself how to write in French, and all of her literary work is in French, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=2997.68s)]
*  and I read her- I came to her in Italian, so I came to her in translation, but not in an [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3008.8799999999997s)]
*  English translation, an Italian translation, and my life was never the same after reading her. I [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3015.7599999999998s)]
*  mean, she's just one of those readers who just- you remain forever altered. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3021.6s)]
*  Extraordinarily powerful, a deep, profound, profound writer, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3029.92s)]
*  dark, but very human, and just the kind of stuff that you don't find very easily. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3038.56s)]
*  Anyway, but she is inspiring to me deeply because of this incredible effort she made [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3048.0s)]
*  her whole life to try to express herself in a learned language. Now, of course, the difference [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3057.36s)]
*  between her and myself is that she- I think she always had a sort of antagonistic relationship [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3064.0s)]
*  with French, even though she went out of her way to learn it and to express herself in it because [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3075.2s)]
*  she was living in Switzerland, and she felt that she couldn't really function as a writer without [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3079.2799999999997s)]
*  expressing herself in French, whereas I've sort of gone out of my way to do this crazy thing that [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3084.48s)]
*  everyone discourages me from doing, which is writing in Italian. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3089.52s)]
*  And you were fascinated with Italy way back when, right? For a long time. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3093.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in a growing way. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3098.96s)]
*  Now, your most recent book, The Clothing of Books, it's about book covers. So I once had a hypothesis [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3106.64s)]
*  about book covers, and I thought I would go to a Borders bookstore when it still existed and look [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3112.96s)]
*  at everything on the front table and try to ignore all other information I had about the book and [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3118.96s)]
*  simply buy the one whose cover appealed to me the most. And I wanted to see whether the publishing [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3124.72s)]
*  trade actually would do a good job of designing a cover so that it would match what I was looking [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3131.3599999999997s)]
*  for in a book. And I ended up buying Kate Christiansen's The Great Man, which I thought [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3136.8799999999997s)]
*  was quite a good novel. And I only did that once, but I considered the experiment to be a success. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3142.0s)]
*  So do you think, based on your study of book covers, your own books aside, but are book covers [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3148.2400000000002s)]
*  assigned to books efficiently, or is there something in the process that's gone wrong? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3153.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've never tried this experiment. I will, maybe. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3162.1600000000003s)]
*  It's hard to block out all the other information because you recognize names, publishing house names, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3169.36s)]
*  where they put it on the table, but still, you can approximate it. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3174.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I talk a little bit in this little essay about being drawn to certain books just [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3182.72s)]
*  because there's some allure, appeal, something I'm projecting, something the book is projecting, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3188.72s)]
*  something I'm projecting onto the book, some relationship I want to have with the book because [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3194.56s)]
*  it's, I don't know, some landscape I want to find myself in someday. I don't know. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3198.48s)]
*  I mean, if you think of a book as a mirror, right, and if you just sort of think, well, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3207.04s)]
*  that's how I would like to look if I were a tree or if I were a whatever, some image. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3210.8s)]
*  But the essay is really about the disconnect between what's on the outside and what's on the [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3218.08s)]
*  inside often and what that feels like from a writer's point of view because it's both a [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3225.2000000000003s)]
*  disconnect and a source of, can be at least for me, a source of real anguish because you can't [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3232.0s)]
*  really disconnect from the outside. And so I think that's the kind of thing that I'm trying to [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3239.36s)]
*  you can't really disconnect yourself from what you look like, you know. You can try, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3245.6s)]
*  but you can't really, you know. Like when I read A Customed Earth and if I try to think of it as a [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3251.52s)]
*  kind of song cycle, I try to put the cover out of my mind because I know how the covers are done and [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3256.6400000000003s)]
*  assigned and I figure, well, the cover will mislead me because you didn't do it, but I find I can't [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3261.92s)]
*  put it out of my mind, even being aware of the entire process. And there's something about, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3269.44s)]
*  the floating tiara or crown or whatever it is, it leaves an imprint on my impression of the book, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3274.3999999999996s)]
*  even though I know it's not by you. It's this. It's that. Oh, you have it on. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3280.24s)]
*  I think that's what they literally designed it after. Yeah. So it's a very pretty cover, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3287.12s)]
*  but maybe it's too pretty. I think. I'm not going to get in any trouble. Any more trouble [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3291.92s)]
*  that I'm already in. How do you feel about blurbs? Well, I mean, I say what I feel about [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3298.48s)]
*  blurbs in the essay. You know, some of my publishers have been a little uncomfortable [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3305.28s)]
*  about publishing that sentence in my book actually, because I just say what I feel. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3310.8s)]
*  And I think this is what one of the things about writing in Italian that people aren't prepared [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3317.36s)]
*  for is that I actually don't pretend anymore. And I try not to, you know, I'm not concerned about [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3322.16s)]
*  making everybody happy. But no, I mean, one of the things I say in the book, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3330.0s)]
*  in this essay is that I actually can't, these books don't even, I mean, as much as I appreciate [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3338.0s)]
*  truly this lovely display that you made, but this isn't my book anymore. You know, this, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3344.16s)]
*  once the cover is on it, it's not my book. And again, I mean, having lived in Italy and having [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3350.32s)]
*  Italian writer friends, so many examples of novels there have covers chosen by the author. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3356.96s)]
*  Imagine that. But, you know, but suddenly you have a whole, you know, you have the inside, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3367.44s)]
*  you have the words, you have the pages that the author created, and you actually, you have an [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3375.36s)]
*  image that the author felt that they wanted, he or she wanted to represent visually what the book is [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3380.5600000000004s)]
*  saying. I mean, if I had that freedom, if I had that ability, I would be such a happy, you know, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3388.2400000000002s)]
*  it would make making to going to museums even more exciting because I would always be thinking, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3393.92s)]
*  oh, maybe, you know, maybe this, maybe that, you know, who knows, maybe an image could even [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3398.96s)]
*  inspire a book in that sense. If one had that ability to say, oh, you know what, I went to [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3404.56s)]
*  the show, this gallery the other day, and I saw this image, and it was so beautiful, and I was [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3410.4s)]
*  thinking about it, and this whole novel grew out of it, or this whole collection of stories, or [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3415.36s)]
*  whatever. These things can happen. They just don't happen here as much as I wish they did. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3419.04s)]
*  I brought a copy of a German book. It's by Rilke, the publisher's reclam. The cover is plain. It's [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3425.9199999999996s)]
*  just a color, and if you go to German bookstores, at least parts of them, they're actually organized [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3432.3999999999996s)]
*  by publishers, you probably know, other countries in Europe sometimes. Like in Italy too, and France. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3437.8399999999997s)]
*  And the books, more or less, all look the same. How do you feel about this system? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3441.9199999999996s)]
*  I love them. So you would opt into this system for all of your books. Yeah, well, I mean, I talk about [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3445.4399999999996s)]
*  that in the book. I mean, the whole piece is a kind of meditation on the idea of wearing a uniform [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3449.2s)]
*  and dressing yourself, and how these contradictory approaches to presenting oneself, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3457.12s)]
*  what they mean. It's like you have to make a statement about where you've decided to rest [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3470.96s)]
*  on the identity question, and a cover forces your hand in a way you'd rather be hovering in this [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3476.64s)]
*  ambiguity. Yeah, I mean, I prefer this kind of cover, because to me, there's a protective quality [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3482.48s)]
*  to the lack of specificity and the belonging to the series, which is what Europe... I mean, in the [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3490.96s)]
*  U.S. you have certain series as well, and in fact, I was thinking... I wrote the essay when I was in [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3501.12s)]
*  Rome, and I was far away from my American library and my books and things, but now that I'm back [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3508.96s)]
*  here and I unpacked a lot of my books... I mean, there are certain presses here that have that [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3514.64s)]
*  aesthetic philosophy. City Lights Books makes those beautiful little books of like my copy of [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3520.64s)]
*  Allen Ginsberg's Howl and etc. I mean, these are beautiful books, American books that all kind of [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3526.8s)]
*  looked the same, similar dimensions, have a kind of sober quality, a lot of emphasis on type. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3533.1200000000003s)]
*  So I won't say that it doesn't happen here, but I think for the average writer and the average [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3541.6800000000003s)]
*  publisher, it's a very different dialogue that's happening when it comes to putting a book, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3547.36s)]
*  putting a cover onto a book. And so I think if I had to choose, I would choose [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3552.24s)]
*  the safety of the uniform because of course... I mean, the whole piece, the whole little essay, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3561.36s)]
*  whatever begins with the memory of being a child and being traumatized by having to dress myself, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3566.48s)]
*  because it just churned up so many problems and was a source of true anguish for me as a child. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3573.92s)]
*  To have to put on my... to choose clothes and put them on. And this has economic ramifications, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3581.6s)]
*  this has cultural ramifications, this has all sorts of ramifications because clothes are [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3588.56s)]
*  things we buy in stores and etc. etc. And so I had this sort of crazy [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3596.08s)]
*  envy, admiration, envy, obsession with my cousin's school uniforms in Calcutta [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3602.72s)]
*  because they were all the same and they just put on what they had to wear to school every day and it [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3612.7999999999997s)]
*  was the same thing. And I dreamed about that. I dreamed of being able to wake up in the United [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3617.92s)]
*  States and just putting on my blue skirt and my white shirt and my black shoes and going to school [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3623.7599999999998s)]
*  and nobody commenting on what I was wearing because I was always so terrified because people [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3628.88s)]
*  were always commenting on what I was wearing and either teasing me or whatever. And so in that sense, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3636.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there's this kind of... where do you stand between wanting to express yourself and be free [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3646.1600000000003s)]
*  and being afraid of that freedom and being actually vulnerable to that freedom? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3653.76s)]
*  I mean, I think America represents freedom with a big capital F and it always has and we hope it [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3662.6400000000003s)]
*  always will for the good. But there's also the danger of that in that even as a young girl in [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3669.2000000000003s)]
*  the 70s, as a kid, immigrant, child of immigrants, I knew what it meant to shop in one store versus [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3676.88s)]
*  another store. I saw what the girls in my class were wearing, the kinds of shoes, the kinds of [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3684.8s)]
*  purses. I knew that my parents weren't taking me to those stores, that they thought that was a [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3689.44s)]
*  waste of money and that we're not going to pay all of this $40 for Nike sneakers or whatever it is [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3693.28s)]
*  because it's a waste and you're going to grow out of them in six months. Whereas my other schoolmates [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3699.36s)]
*  had these things and suddenly there was the gap between me and them, reinforced by these things. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3703.68s)]
*  And I think for a child, at least for me, these things were traumatizing. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3710.08s)]
*  And I imagine for others as well. Two last questions before we get to Q&A. I'll give them [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3715.9199999999996s)]
*  both to you together. First, what do you love most in Indian classical music? And second, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3720.64s)]
*  what are you working on next? Well, again, from my mother, I inherited, received, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3725.52s)]
*  learned to appreciate Indian classical music, most of all sitar music, which she's always been [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3735.2s)]
*  passionate about. And my family, all my uncles, my great uncles, my cousins, I mean, I come from a [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3745.12s)]
*  broad extended family, passionate enthusiasts of the instrument of Aliad Barkan and Amzad Ali Khan. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3752.88s)]
*  And so I grew up my whole life listening to this very complex, beautiful music that really has spoken [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3766.4s)]
*  to me. And just the other day I was in the Princeton Art Museum. There's a beautiful [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3778.96s)]
*  exhibit there right now, which it's not that far. I really do recommend a big collection of [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3784.96s)]
*  miniatures, two big rooms of extraordinary works. And one of the whole chambers of this exhibit is [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3790.96s)]
*  dedicated to miniatures basically inspired by the the rock cycles. And there were headphones [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3798.96s)]
*  and I put them on and I was listening to one of them. And it's just a part of, that music is a [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3806.88s)]
*  part of me. And I really am very, it's sort of part of my formation. I think it's extraordinary. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3812.6400000000003s)]
*  And your next work? Well, my next work, so I have two kind of things that are happening. One is, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3823.36s)]
*  so I just translated this novel called Ties in English. It's Lacci is the Italian title by [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3831.2s)]
*  Domenico Sarnone, who is my friend and whom I consider the finest Italian living author. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3841.52s)]
*  And I just translated this novel. I'm just at the final stages and it will be out in March. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3851.52s)]
*  I think it's an amazing novel. I read it two years ago and it was first published. I'm [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3856.7999999999997s)]
*  so grateful for the opportunity to have brought it into English. I'm really excited about it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3862.3999999999996s)]
*  And then on the other side, I am slowly, quietly writing some short, very short stories in Italian. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3871.04s)]
*  Ciampa Lahiri, thank you very much. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3884.88s)]
*  Four questions, queue with the two mics. Please keep in mind these are questions, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3896.24s)]
*  not statements. If you go on and on, I will cut you off and we will alternate mics. Natasha? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3901.28s)]
*  I was hoping you would ask about it, but, and I think everybody asks about it and maybe it's not [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3909.68s)]
*  such an interesting question anymore, but it's interesting to me and I'm hoping you would answer. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3916.32s)]
*  You mentioned that you really like Elena Ferrante and we all do too, at least most of us. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3922.48s)]
*  And I wanted to hear your take on all this anonymity situation and whether you think [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3929.2s)]
*  right now, is it considered in Italy that everybody really knows who she is after all these [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3939.92s)]
*  articles which came out or is it still a mystery and just what's your take on the whole situation? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3947.84s)]
*  Well, I think the whole situation is, you know, completely blown out of proportion and ridiculous. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3958.4s)]
*  I know personally the person who has been accused of being Elena Ferrante, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3965.92s)]
*  or she's actually the wife of Domenico Sarnone, who has also been, you know, accused whatever [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3979.36s)]
*  the word is. I mean, it is like a trial though. I mean, and this is the absurd thing because [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3989.2000000000003s)]
*  whoever wrote those books did nothing wrong and it's been treated almost as if it were a crime. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=3993.6s)]
*  And the nature of the article, the very violent article, an appropriate article that was published [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4001.6800000000003s)]
*  a couple of months ago, the language of that was very disturbing and offensive to me. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4007.6800000000003s)]
*  Whoever wrote those books, the world doesn't know better off knowing who the actual person is. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4015.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think, you know, we've all completely lost perspective in that, you know, so many beautiful [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4023.6800000000003s)]
*  things have been created by mankind that we still go to look at and marvel at or read or whatever [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4028.96s)]
*  the case may be and nobody's hung up on who exactly the person was and what their name was and when [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4036.7200000000003s)]
*  they're, what their birthday is or, you know, this whole cult of the individual and the individual's [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4043.44s)]
*  hand and signature behind what's being done. These are kind of recent concepts if you think about them. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4050.56s)]
*  So, I mean, and again, people in Italy just, they don't care about this, you know. I mean, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4059.52s)]
*  they have their own things, they have other things to think about and worry about at this point. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4066.72s)]
*  So this whole Teranti thing, you know, I mean, the article came out, you know, I exchanged some [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4070.96s)]
*  messages with my friends saying, you know, this is just disgusting and why and so unnecessary. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4076.72s)]
*  And then everybody moved on whereas I think here in America it's become, it's just going, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4083.68s)]
*  it's just ongoing and it never, it's just not dying. It's not, people aren't moving on and saying, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4089.04s)]
*  you know, let's just either read the books or not read the books. But, you know, if someone goes out [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4096.08s)]
*  of their way to say, you know, I would like to write with anonymity, why that can't be respected [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4102.24s)]
*  in our culture is really a kind of, you know, mystifying to me and also distressing in terms of, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4108.639999999999s)]
*  you know, what that means and the projection people have onto the idea of, you know, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4119.12s)]
*  who the writer might be and the reasons and, you know, all of the speculation which, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4129.36s)]
*  which it could be a very simple, simple thing, you know. But it's become, it's become kind of [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4134.64s)]
*  contorted, I feel like, at least in the United States, maybe in England, I don't know. But it's [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4142.08s)]
*  not the same in Italy, people aren't really talking about it in the same way. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4148.08s)]
*  Next question. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4153.04s)]
*  Next question. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4154.32s)]
*  Hello, Ms. Lahiri. I admire your writing. I'll start with this. So thank you for all your books. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4156.72s)]
*  I grew up in Poland, actually, and my first degree is from Gdańsk University. I'm bilingual, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4163.76s)]
*  but I teach English here and I write in English. I'm a fiction writer. When I think about being [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4169.36s)]
*  bilingual, I feel like I'm inhabited, inhabiting two different types of personality. When I am [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4177.2s)]
*  in Polish, I'm a different person than when I'm in English. And I was wondering if you could talk a [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4183.679999999999s)]
*  little bit about being bilingual and writing in Italian now. Do you feel like you are one person [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4189.04s)]
*  who inhabits sort of two different worlds or you feel yourself splitting apart and sort of feeling [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4194.639999999999s)]
*  that you are, depending on the language, a totally different sort of person? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4201.04s)]
*  Well, I think anybody who is fortunate enough to have more than one language recognizes that, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4209.6s)]
*  you know, I mean, some people go so far as to say, if you know more than one language, you have more [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4215.92s)]
*  than one soul. And that's a very thoughtful way of thinking about it. But I think, you know, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4220.88s)]
*  language represents, you know, kind of a very specific but vast universe. And each language [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4230.16s)]
*  represents that. And I think, you know, even before I learned Italian, I always grew up with [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4238.4s)]
*  two languages side by side. And maybe I didn't know them in exactly the right kind of the same [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4245.36s)]
*  level of proficiency. But they were both incredibly strong influences on who I was. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4252.72s)]
*  So, you know, I always was, you know, divided in that sense. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4263.68s)]
*  So I think that's true. And I can say for the Italian project, you know, as I was saying, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4274.320000000001s)]
*  you know, this idea of a new point of view that comes from a new language. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4280.32s)]
*  And in addition, the sense of freedom that a learned language might provide you to just kind of, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4286.24s)]
*  you know, set to the side a certain baggage that the long distance [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4294.72s)]
*  you traverse in another language, you know, might be in some sense holding you back. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4302.96s)]
*  From saying what you really need to say. So, for example, I would never have written [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4309.68s)]
*  another words in English. I would never have written the clothing of books essay in English, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4315.2s)]
*  you know. So this is why the Italian is valuable to me. It's interesting. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4320.8s)]
*  Next question. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4327.52s)]
*  Hi, Jhampa. So one thing I found really interesting about the namesake was how you describe Gogol as [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4328.240000000001s)]
*  kind of olive toned and sort of being able to pass as Mediterranean sometimes. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4336.5599999999995s)]
*  And I think that's really interesting, especially given the obvious tension between his kind of [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4341.44s)]
*  Indian identity and assimilating into American culture. And so was this a conscious decision [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4347.5199999999995s)]
*  to make him able to sort of pass as white? And if so, can you speak to how this relates to your own [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4355.84s)]
*  experiences of colorism and passing? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4362.56s)]
*  Well, I wasn't really thinking about those things. I think I'm now recalling maybe there's a moment [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4368.64s)]
*  in the book where someone says to him, oh, you could be Spanish or something. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4381.200000000001s)]
*  But I think that's more about projecting, not about who he is, but maybe how we project, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4388.24s)]
*  what we how we like to project kind of sameness onto other people, right, to make them more [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4395.36s)]
*  comfortable to us and to dilute the sense of difference. Maybe that's what it's really about. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4402.08s)]
*  Just to go back to this book covers piece, there's a certain part of the essay in which I talk about [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4410.32s)]
*  the intolerance of my foreign publishers for the various book covers. So I remember showing [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4418.4s)]
*  one of my publishers, I'm not going to specify anybody, but I'm going to say that I'm not going [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4428.88s)]
*  to specify anybody here. But I remember, I'll just say this, I was in Rome and the Italian cover of [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4435.04s)]
*  in other words, in Altre Parole, it had come out and one of my other publishers was visiting. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4447.28s)]
*  And I showed it to this person. And I just remember the expression on, you know, it was like, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4453.76s)]
*  interesting, you know. And I think that is really what is at the heart of the matter. It's just that [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4460.64s)]
*  refusal to recognize ourselves in the other, right. So if you have someone who has a kind of, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4469.04s)]
*  you know, features that can be perceived as this or be perceived as that, I mean, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4478.16s)]
*  I mean, depending on where I go in the world, I'm mistaken for lots of things. You know, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4486.24s)]
*  if I'm in Latin America, if I'm in India, if I'm in, you know, maybe some other places, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4491.12s)]
*  and sometimes not. And sometimes I'm immediately identified as the other. But I think it's sort of [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4495.84s)]
*  more based on the context and not on the person. But I wasn't really thinking very deeply about it, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4500.72s)]
*  to be honest with you. I think it was just one of the reasons why I was so interested in this book. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4508.88s)]
*  It's one of those small details about other people's desire to render the same people who are [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4515.76s)]
*  actually different, you know. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4524.96s)]
*  Next question. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4527.360000000001s)]
*  Excuse me. One thing that I find so powerful about your work is that you not only understand [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4531.360000000001s)]
*  the viewpoint of being a child of immigrants, but also your parents' viewpoint as well. And if you [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4536.16s)]
*  feel comfortable sharing, I'm wondering to what extent have you spoken to your parents about the [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4542.64s)]
*  joys and challenges of the immigrant experience? Or was that something that you more so inferred [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4547.68s)]
*  from your own observations? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4553.6s)]
*  So you're asking if I asked my parents what it was like to be an immigrant? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4559.6s)]
*  Did you ever have those deep, meaningful conversations about that experience? Or did you [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4563.6s)]
*  feel like it was more so something that you observed? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4568.160000000001s)]
*  I was living that experience. That was my whole experience. That was my whole life. I mean, there was no moment [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4572.64s)]
*  where I wasn't aware that my parents came from a place that was very far away, where people spoke a [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4580.160000000001s)]
*  different language and ate different food and wore different clothes and thought about the world in [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4588.0s)]
*  different ways and that they were not there. You know, and that's my life. That's my whole life. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4592.08s)]
*  And there's no part of my life that was anything else. You know, I mean, in every relationship I had [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4601.2s)]
*  that I made, that I created, that I forged outside of my family kind of base was informed by that [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4609.12s)]
*  awareness, you know, that these were the parents that had brought me into the world and this is [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4620.32s)]
*  what their experience was. So no, I never sat down and asked them what it was like because I was [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4626.64s)]
*  living it every single day and I saw the effects of what it means to live your life [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4636.08s)]
*  away from your point of reference, right? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4644.08s)]
*  And this just goes so deep and so vast and so specific and so minute by minute [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4648.08s)]
*  and that constant back and forth, you know, in one's being to kind of make sense and to be, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4659.76s)]
*  I mean, it's like, again, the interpreter, you know, it's like being a simultaneous interpreter [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4666.5599999999995s)]
*  all the time. And I think that, of course, it's not ironic that my book is called The Interpreter of [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4672.24s)]
*  Maladies and it involves this character who is literally interpreting simultaneously for people [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4680.4s)]
*  because I feel like that's what, but that's not what I was necessarily doing for my parents, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4686.4s)]
*  it was what I was doing for myself, you know. Next question. Thank you. Firstly, my compliments [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4690.4s)]
*  to both of you for such wonderful conversation. My question is more related to the journey of an [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4697.68s)]
*  author. Do you think compared to when you began writing, do you feel more inhibited or uninhibited [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4702.88s)]
*  as an author now? And what brings that about? Well, writing always scares me and intimidates me [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4712.88s)]
*  and I've always felt that and I think if I ever stopped feeling that, I probably shouldn't write [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4724.639999999999s)]
*  anymore. I think now there's a kind of formal challenge of writing in a language that I don't [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4731.84s)]
*  have full control of. So that's intimidating and just very daunting. But I was talking to [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4742.8s)]
*  a group of students before this larger conversation about how even in English I started out with that [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4756.08s)]
*  same trepidation. And in some sense, I don't want to lose touch with that, you know, that unease [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4761.84s)]
*  because I think that's important. It's important to approach in that way, at least for me, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4770.8s)]
*  you know, not to not feel totally comfortable and certainly not to feel confident because [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4781.92s)]
*  it's really more about an investigation and experiment, a challenge, you know. And so these [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4791.04s)]
*  things cannot be undertaken in the spirit of, sure, I can do that, you know. You have to question it [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4798.32s)]
*  at every step and you have to question what you're doing and how you're doing it and why you're doing [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4806.0s)]
*  it. So I believe that that's very important. Next question. Hi, I just want to start off by thanking [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4811.759999999999s)]
*  you for Gogol's character because there are very few authors that truly understand the Indian-American [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4821.04s)]
*  immigrant narrative as well as you do. And my question is, of all the characters you've penned, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4828.48s)]
*  which one do you see yourself most in or is there one and why? Thank you. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4835.2s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, there are pieces of me and some of various things I've written, aspects, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4846.0s)]
*  kind of concealed or jumbled together, rearranged, you know, so various characters, you know, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4856.96s)]
*  if I had to say, you know, they're shadings that I feel close to literally. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4868.8s)]
*  But I think, as I say in the afterwards, afterward to in other words, the most kind of explicitly [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4876.72s)]
*  autobiographical story I've ever written is the first story I wrote in Italian, which is called [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4886.56s)]
*  The Exchange, which is a very weird abstract story. But that came literally from an experience I had [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4891.76s)]
*  and I wrote the story very quickly afterward based on that experience and it was just sort of lifted [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4901.28s)]
*  from something that had happened to me. So in that sense, I feel very close to that character, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4910.4s)]
*  needless to say, because I shared, you know, what happened, though there are certain invented [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4916.0s)]
*  details in that story as well and I'm not, because it's fiction, you know, it's not the truth. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4922.0s)]
*  But Agata Christoff, if you really want to talk about this stuff and think about it, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4928.16s)]
*  read Agata Christoff because she's just, she's the, she's a genius, she's like the oracle of all of [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4931.76s)]
*  this stuff, you know, she really knows what it means to create out of life and that incredibly [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4937.599999999999s)]
*  fluid, mysterious boundary between real life and art. Her work investigates it just head on in a way [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4948.24s)]
*  that's unforgettable powerful. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4958.4s)]
*  Last question, we have three minutes total. Yes. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4964.4s)]
*  I have a couple of quick nuts and bolts questions about writing and your process. Your prose is very [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4968.4s)]
*  much characterized by restraint and economy and I'm curious what kind of writer you are. Are you a [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4976.4s)]
*  linear writer who gets it, you know, each sentence right before you move on to the next or are you, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4982.639999999999s)]
*  do you overwrite and cut back mercilessly? And my other question is you write often of nostalgia [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4988.16s)]
*  and longing and I'm curious how you avoid sentimentality. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4995.2s)]
*  Well, that's nice to hear. I'm glad that that's the case in your opinion. You know, I think I write about loss. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=4998.64s)]
*  I write less about nostalgia, I think. I mean, it's connected, of course, but that's really what the writing, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=5019.12s)]
*  you know, everything I've written has that at its core, the idea of loss. And as for how I write, I just, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=5031.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how I write, but I certainly am not, you know, I mean, I go through, you know, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=5043.36s)]
*  a million drafts and I'm constantly reworking everything. So, you know, the idea of writing a sentence [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=5049.92s)]
*  that's, you know, that's all set to go and then moving on to the next one is the opposite. Whatever [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=5056.5599999999995s)]
*  the opposite of that is, that's how I work. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=5063.2s)]
*  Jumper, thank you very much. Let's have a big round of applause. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQkK8ThNsOY&t=5067.44s)]
