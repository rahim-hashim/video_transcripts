# Venting is important! | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgIwpiZmhYA)
*  I think venting is like one of those extremely important outlets. It's sort of original safe space in a way where like at some point people say, okay, well, you're clearly off. At least people say this to me. Like, I can go pretty far in venting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgIwpiZmhYA&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, Germans can be going very far. Like, stereotypes are funny because they often are too. Venting catastrophizing these kind of things and then having your friends reel you in. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgIwpiZmhYA&t=13.42s)]
*  The issue, I think we've seen over especially sort of beginning of this decade is as people like ported their venting online and then got their sort of one take retreated forever because it just captured the imagination. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgIwpiZmhYA&t=22.56s)]
*  I feel people misunderstood what was actually going on for a little bit and I hope everyone has sort of acclimatized to this reality now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgIwpiZmhYA&t=36.16s)]
