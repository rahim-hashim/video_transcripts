# Tyler Cowen and Steve Davies talk Theresa May, Brexit, and Europe (Live) | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E)
*  The UK is holding an important election on June 8th, so today we're bringing you some bonus audio on that topic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=0.0s)]
*  It was recorded at an event several weeks ago and features Tyler and Steve Davies of the London-based Institute of Economic Affairs. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  They talk about how the general election could shape the terms of Brexit, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=13.84s)]
*  how much further the EU and even the UK might splinter, the prospects for the European left wing, and the populism underneath it all. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=16.8s)]
*  Now keep in mind this was recorded shortly after Theresa May called for the snap election, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  and as is usual right now a lot has happened since then. Nonetheless, we hope you enjoy the prognosticating. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  And we'll be back next week with Jill Lepore. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=35.6s)]
*  Conversations with Tyler is produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=45.36s)]
*  bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=50.339999999999996s)]

*  conversationswithtyler.com. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  Okay, Steve, you're the one with the British accent. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=67.06s)]
*  Your country has called a snap election. June 8th, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=70.02s)]
*  why did Theresa May do it and how is it going to change the terms of Brexit? What's your take? Well, um, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=73.46s)]
*  the simple answer, of course, for any poll, as for any politician is she's called it because she thinks she's going to win. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=79.94s)]
*  And improve her position in parliament, and that's almost certainly going to be the case. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=86.34s)]
*  Somebody very unkindly observed recently Abraham Lincoln's prospects when he picked up those theatre tickets were better than the Labour parties right now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=91.38s)]
*  But, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=101.62s)]
*  more seriously, there are there are two other reasons for her doing this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  One of them is that she wants a mandate for the kind of Brexit she wants to pursue. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  And the big argument now, I think, in Britain is not should we leave the EU or not. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  I think the British public broadly thinks yes, we've decided to do this. Let's get on with it now, including most people who voted remain. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=118.42s)]
*  But the big argument now is what kind of Brexit should there be? Should there be one which [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  involves Britain remaining in what's called the European Economic Area, which would mean [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=131.78s)]
*  access to the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=136.5s)]
*  regulatory regime of the single market, but also accepting a whole lot of European regulations, obviously, and also a free movement of Labour, or should the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  UK go for a much more independent role, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=147.06s)]
*  not apply for membership of the EEA. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  And that seems to be the one that the government wants to go for. And so she's she wants a mandate for that strategy, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=153.38s)]
*  and that's what the other parties are going to argue against. The other thing is she wants to stamp her own authority on the Conservative party. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=158.66000000000003s)]
*  And I think what this election will do [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  is complete a kind of transformation of the Conservative party away from what it has been for quite a long time, actually. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=168.18s)]
*  I think there's going to be a significant generational change in the British Conservative party, and it's going to become [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=175.06s)]
*  much more of a traditional Conservative party than it has been for quite a long time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=181.22s)]
*  What struck me about the announcement, which to many people, including in her own cabinet, seemed to have been a surprise, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=185.62s)]
*  is that the pound went up 2.7% [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=191.7s)]
*  right after the announcement, and that's quite a significant currency movement. Now, is this the right way to think about that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=194.26s)]
*  That she had her own [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=201.22s)]
*  backbenchers who were deep Euro skeptics, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=203.54s)]
*  and now they're actually cut out of the equation. They don't have a veto anymore. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=206.9s)]
*  So she can, on one hand, give a more centrist way of leaving the European Union, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=211.54s)]
*  but on the other hand, due to your fixed term, Parliament's Act, when the next election has to be, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=216.66s)]
*  that doesn't have to be right after March 2019. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=222.66s)]
*  So she can, again, do the kind of Brexit she wants without the next election being a referendum on that, because that's now more put off. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  So no one thought she would do this, but I see the pound going up. I think of those two factors. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=236.1s)]
*  I actually think she's much smarter [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=240.89999999999998s)]
*  than all the people who thought this wouldn't happen, and do you agree with that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=243.54s)]
*  I agree completely with that. Yes, she's postponed the, otherwise it would have been very, very awkward. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=247.45999999999998s)]
*  They would have been having an election a year after the Brexit negotiations were concluded, and that could have been very, very difficult. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=251.62s)]
*  Now there's going to be a big gap. She will have time to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=258.42s)]
*  sort out any problems that arise from the actual way in which we leave the EU, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=262.26s)]
*  and also a lot of people like the prospect of there being a decisive [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=267.94s)]
*  and conclusive result in the election, which there's clearly going to be, I would say. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=272.98s)]
*  And so yes, I think it is probably a very smart move from her part. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=277.62s)]
*  So how hard will the hard Brexit be? So Theresa May has said she's not going to take in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=280.5s)]
*  migrants from the EU as a matter of law. Some may be taken in on a discretionary basis. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=286.16s)]
*  She's making that a campaign pledge, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  so that would seem to rule out an arrangement like that of Switzerland or Norway, an EEA-like arrangement. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  That seems to mean hard Brexit, since the European Union doesn't seem to be giving in. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  What rights will the London financial sector have to sell product on the continent? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=305.7s)]
*  What will rates of tariff be? Will it be default WTO rates? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=311.62s)]
*  Or what will it look like, say, five years from now? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=315.14s)]
*  That is very tricky because in terms of the three different issues there, one of them is that the government is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=317.38s)]
*  deciding to go for, I think, a very hard Brexit. I agree with that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  Mainly, I think, for the very bad reason that they want to impose controls on immigration from the EU. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=328.1s)]
*  And they can't do that if they're part of the European economic area because the European countries quite reasonably, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=334.58s)]
*  I think, say, look, there's a whole package deal here and free movement of labor is part of the package deal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=339.3s)]
*  You can't pick and choose what you get. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=344.66s)]
*  So [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=347.54s)]
*  they've decided, I think, very incorrectly that they, for political reasons, they don't want to do that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=348.66s)]
*  and therefore they're not going to be part of the EEA. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=355.06s)]
*  Now, the question then is, well, are they going to be able to get a trade deal with the EU of the kind of Swiss type [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=357.62s)]
*  before the deadline fall of 2019 when the two-year ticking clock finally hits midnight? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=363.7s)]
*  My own view is probably not, actually, because [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=370.98s)]
*  any deal has to be agreed by the 27 remaining members. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=375.22s)]
*  And getting all 27 of them to agree to it is very, very difficult. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=378.98s)]
*  Now, this is a case of British strategy coming back to bite them, if you will, because [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=384.1s)]
*  it was British strategy to expand the EU so enormously in the aftermath of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=389.46s)]
*  collapse of the Soviet Union. And as Sir Humphrey explained very lucidly to Jim Hacker in a very famous episode of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=394.34s)]
*  Yes, Prime Minister, the reason for this was to actually make it so that nothing could get done. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=400.9s)]
*  And that was indeed the reason. As he told, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=407.3s)]
*  as he told Jim Hacker, the goal of British foreign policy for a thousand years had been to bring about a disunited Europe, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=410.5s)]
*  which is completely true. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=417.22s)]
*  And so the problem is therefore, I think we're not going to have a deal at the end of the two years. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=419.22s)]
*  So I think we are probably going to need either to revert to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=423.7s)]
*  WTO rules or I think more likely we will have an interim agreement put in place. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=429.7s)]
*  That's where the hard argument will be about what that interim agreement is. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=434.74s)]
*  Now as to the City of London, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=438.26s)]
*  there's a lot of talk at the moment that the City of London is going to lose its so-called [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=441.38s)]
*  passporting rights, which means that it can conduct business in euros. Last year before the referendum, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=452.5s)]
*  City of London did just under a trillion euros worth of euro denominated business. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=453.78000000000003s)]
*  It's a lot of business. So if they were to lose that, that would be an enormous blow to them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=459.46000000000004s)]
*  The European Central Bank would dearly like to yank that privilege because it didn't want them to have it in the first place. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=466.1s)]
*  But they have nowhere to put it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=472.5s)]
*  But they've nowhere to put it. The problem for the Europeans, however, is that you can't build up a major financial center [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=473.54s)]
*  like the City of London in somewhere like Frankfurt or Paris overnight. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=478.98s)]
*  It's a much more drawn out process. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=483.62s)]
*  So I think in the medium term, at any rate, the City of London probably will be given passporting privileges, but [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=485.7s)]
*  in the more medium term, a lot of business will shift to the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=492.58s)]
*  continent, to Frankfurt primarily, but also Paris. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=496.5s)]
*  But you're talking about a 15-year kind of time horizon for that rather than an abrupt cliff edge transition, I think. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=499.22s)]
*  And now, if you don't consider me too rude, I'd like to ask if your country is falling apart. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=506.02s)]
*  So in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon is asking for, some would say demanding, a second referendum. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=510.66s)]
*  You could argue that ever since devolution, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=516.66s)]
*  the attention of the Scots is focused on their own politics in a way that makes them feel much more separate from England. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=519.38s)]
*  And that won't change. And of course, they feel that their votes were disregarded in the decision for Brexit. Brexit is now quite hard. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=527.3000000000001s)]
*  SMP, the independence party, has done very well in the most recent elections. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=536.2600000000001s)]
*  It's at least, we're not sure how well they'll do this time around. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=541.1400000000001s)]
*  But is Great Britain going to splinter? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=544.9000000000001s)]
*  Because Scotland will leave. And you might say, oh, that would be insane. What currency would they use? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=548.58s)]
*  How would they bail out their banking system? The price of oil is down. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=552.9s)]
*  But given that the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  which many people advised against, seems we can't dismiss the possibility that having said A, one then says B. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=560.34s)]
*  So is Scotland going to leave? Yes or no? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=566.1s)]
*  I think [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=568.34s)]
*  I actually think [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=571.46s)]
*  I would like to say yes, but I think no. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=573.62s)]
*  You want them to go. Oh, I definitely do. Tell us why. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=579.62s)]
*  My attitude and the attitude actually the majority of English is that it would be pretty good to get rid of the bloody Scots. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=584.4200000000001s)]
*  If there was a referendum on Scottish independence purely in England, there would be a clear majority in favor. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=590.1800000000001s)]
*  Mr. Without the oil, North Sea. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=597.78s)]
*  Well, that's a diminishing asset anyway, actually. The production rate from the North Sea is declining dramatically. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=600.5799999999999s)]
*  I think Nicola Sturgeon has a perfect right to call another referendum, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=606.8199999999999s)]
*  because she did say that if there was a major change in circumstances, they would call another one. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=610.42s)]
*  And quite clearly there's been a major change in circumstances. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=614.66s)]
*  And as you rightly say, Scotland's view on Brexit is radically different from that of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=617.62s)]
*  England and Wales. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=623.06s)]
*  Now, the whether or not she will get a vote in favor of [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=624.6600000000001s)]
*  leaving the UK is more open to question because [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=629.86s)]
*  the problem there is that leaving the UK if the UK is still in the EU [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=634.0200000000001s)]
*  is not quite as frightening as the prospect of leaving the UK if the UK is outside the EU. Because a [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=639.86s)]
*  that requires the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=647.5400000000001s)]
*  the EU if the goal of it is to stay in the EU to give Scotland membership and Spain in particular [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=649.38s)]
*  is probably going to veto Scotland becoming a member of the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=655.06s)]
*  EU because they do not want to give encouragement to separatist movements for obvious reasons. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=658.58s)]
*  But also [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=664.42s)]
*  the other the other problem is that that would mean a hard border between England and Scotland and that's a lot more scary [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=666.5s)]
*  than [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=673.62s)]
*  the prospect of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=674.74s)]
*  being two separate countries, but with still no no hard border at all. And the Scots as a nation are actually [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=676.18s)]
*  very small-see conservative. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=683.54s)]
*  So I think that actually if push comes to shove they will very narrowly vote to remain in the Union. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=685.38s)]
*  Actually personally, I wish they would vote to leave. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=690.66s)]
*  And quite apart from all joking aside, I think there's a very good reason for that, which is well two good reasons. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=693.62s)]
*  One is that my general view is that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=699.3s)]
*  small to medium-sized countries, countries up to about seven million people, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=701.78s)]
*  empirically do better, have better governance, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=705.6999999999999s)]
*  better economic policy than large countries because public choice problems are less severe in small countries. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=708.8199999999999s)]
*  And the other thing is that Scotland has very very severe social problems, basically Greater Glasgow, and they're not going to address those problems [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=715.06s)]
*  in a mature way as long as they can blame them all on the English. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=723.2199999999999s)]
*  At the moment all the problems of Glasgow are pushed onto the English taxpayer. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=727.54s)]
*  Whereas if it was the Edinburgh taxpayer who was having to pick up the tab that would really concentrate some minds very sharply. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=732.5799999999999s)]
*  And if any of you know anything about the rivalry between Glasgow and Edinburgh, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=739.38s)]
*  well, you know, you'd realize that something would be done to sort out Glasgow pretty quickly if that was the case. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=743.62s)]
*  And so I think Scotland actually would have to sort its own problems out [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=749.86s)]
*  in a way that it's not going to do if it can blame everything on the hated English. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=752.98s)]
*  So I would actually wish that they would vote to leave, but I fear that they will narrowly decide to stay with us. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=757.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, on the other hand, Ireland, which I know... [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=762.74s)]
*  The Shetland Islands first, there's a growing separatist movement in the Shetland Islands. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=765.46s)]
*  Oh, yes, well, yes. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=769.94s)]
*  With now 400 people in support, are you hoping for them to leave Scotland? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=770.74s)]
*  I would, actually, yes I would. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=774.34s)]
*  The Shetlands would have a wonderful future as a kind of Nordic little island. That's where the oil is, actually. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=776.98s)]
*  The 40s and the other two major fields are both in Shetland waters. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=784.1800000000001s)]
*  And Shetland, actually, historically not a part of Scotland, part of Norway, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=788.6600000000001s)]
*  came to Scotland just a few hundred years ago. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=793.14s)]
*  So my people, the Irish, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=795.5400000000001s)]
*  now, there's no border whatsoever between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=798.34s)]
*  When you drive from one to the other, the sign changes from kilometres to miles. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=802.6600000000001s)]
*  You get a different cell phone signal. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=806.74s)]
*  But so many people from Ireland proper now have summer homes in the North, or they're connected in some way. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=808.5s)]
*  There are actually homes built that straddle the border. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=814.9799999999999s)]
*  You go from one room of the house to another, and you go from one country to another. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=817.78s)]
*  There's been peace since the Belfast agreement. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=821.86s)]
*  Is it now not [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=824.5s)]
*  truly inconceivable to reinstitute a hard border between the two Ireland's? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=826.9s)]
*  And what will be done because of this fact? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=831.86s)]
*  Will we not end up with the border being between Belfast and Heathrow Airport, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=833.94s)]
*  rather than a long Donagall county between the two Ireland's? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=838.74s)]
*  Tell us. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=841.62s)]
*  No, I think what will happen is that the Irish government and the British government will agree that the Irish government will do the British government's dirty work [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=842.0200000000001s)]
*  and have all the border controls and checks in places like Waterford, Cork and Dublin, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=848.58s)]
*  which is what happened before 1971, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=854.4200000000001s)]
*  rather than what you suggest. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=857.7s)]
*  Because nobody, I think, in their right mind, wants to have a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=859.7800000000001s)]
*  It's a complete joke anyway. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=863.94s)]
*  I mean, the kind of things you talk about are not new. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=865.46s)]
*  Even when the troubles were going on, with all the block houses and the fences were around, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  it was still very hard to tell where the border was in places like Fermanagh and South Armagh. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=873.46s)]
*  So nobody really wants that. I actually think, though, there is a, while I think Scotland will stay in the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=877.7800000000001s)]
*  UK, I think there is quite a realistic chance that Northern Ireland will vote to join the Republic, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=882.98s)]
*  or join the Republic under some kind of condominium, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=888.02s)]
*  co-dominium scheme. I think that's actually quite possible because [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=891.12s)]
*  for one thing the demographics are changing, the next census is probably going to show a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=895.78s)]
*  which doesn't necessarily mean a majority for union in the Republic, but it's a major shift and also [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=902.1s)]
*  increasingly the younger generation of the Protestant population in Northern Ireland are not as attached to the historic Ulster identity [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=909.22s)]
*  as the older generation are. And I actually think that there's quite likely that there will be [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=916.02s)]
*  a significant move, if not fully, towards United Ireland in the direction of United Ireland as a result of Brexit. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=923.7s)]
*  I think that's one of the, which also I think would be a good thing in many ways, and I think that's another one of the consequences [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=930.1s)]
*  that will follow from it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=934.74s)]
*  And why is it there's a movement, it has different names, some people call it populism, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=935.94s)]
*  I'm not sure that's the right word because it's not always that popular, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=940.74s)]
*  but in England we've had it in parts of the United States. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=944.66s)]
*  You don't really have it much at all in Ireland, you don't have it much at all in Spain. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=948.98s)]
*  It's growing in France, especially with young people, we'll see how strong it is. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=954.74s)]
*  It was strong in the Netherlands, but it failed, though because the more centrist parties moved sharply to the right. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=959.0600000000001s)]
*  Two interrelated questions. Why have left-wing parties in so many countries become so weak? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=965.38s)]
*  So, labour in England is just a joke, right? It's not even a joke. It's one reason why Theresa May can call another election. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=971.06s)]
*  Social democratic parties across the continent are looking extremely weak pretty consistently, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=978.5s)]
*  but in some but not all other countries there are these rising populist or alt-right movements. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=984.02s)]
*  I mean, what's your take on the broader developments [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=988.9799999999999s)]
*  that are driving this new and actually pretty startling configuration of loyalties? How do you see that? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=992.26s)]
*  Well, the thing is this is the predominant trend. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=997.38s)]
*  The thing you described as the predominant trend throughout most of Europe and I think many other parts of the world as well. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1001.54s)]
*  But some parts are immune too. We want to explain the cross-sectional variation. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1005.78s)]
*  The immune bits are places like Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Japan. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1009.4599999999999s)]
*  Is it a Catholic thing? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't think it is because Italy's got populism, France has got it. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1016.18s)]
*  It's pretty strong in parts of Germany as well. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1020.66s)]
*  I think there are two things going on. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1022.9799999999999s)]
*  One, well, first let me say a lot of people say this is due to economic factors. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1024.82s)]
*  It's due to a feeling of disaffection by the losers from globalization. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1030.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't think that is actually true. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1034.58s)]
*  You may disagree with me on this. I'll come back to you on that in a moment. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1036.4199999999998s)]
*  I think this is about the politics of identity. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1039.22s)]
*  I think what is happening in many countries is that a lot of people feel that their identity is threatened [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1041.62s)]
*  by globalization, by the social, cultural, technological changes, mass migration, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1047.9399999999998s)]
*  a whole range of other things that have taken place in the last 20 to 30 years. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1053.14s)]
*  These are people who basically want the world to stay roughly the same. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1056.74s)]
*  They feel threatened by radical dramatic change. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1062.74s)]
*  They feel that their identity is under assault. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1066.02s)]
*  And what they are coming to support is a kind of very unpleasant politics [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1068.8200000000002s)]
*  which combines, as in the case of Marion Le Pen for example, very left of center economics. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1072.3400000000001s)]
*  She's well to the left of most socialist parties in economics. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1079.14s)]
*  With anti-globalism, cultural traditionalism and authoritarianism and anti-immigration policies. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1082.58s)]
*  And this is a politics which is on the rise in most parts of Europe. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1091.1399999999999s)]
*  Now the other question you ask is what's happened with the social democrats? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1095.22s)]
*  Well the big story in the Dutch election actually which did not get covered [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1098.74s)]
*  was the complete collapse of the Dutch Labour Party. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1102.74s)]
*  One of the great historic parties of Dutch politics. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1105.1399999999999s)]
*  It collapsed from 24% of the vote to just under 6% of the vote. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1108.42s)]
*  And why are these parties so weak and Labour in England? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1114.26s)]
*  For a very simple reason. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1117.3s)]
*  Because basically they are trying to appeal to two radically different [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1118.66s)]
*  and increasingly hostile blocks of voters. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1122.34s)]
*  On the one hand traditional, typically older, white, working class voters [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1125.54s)]
*  who are economically left wing but culturally very traditionalist and very conservative. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1130.26s)]
*  And on the other hand a more metropolitan, younger, very green, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1134.66s)]
*  very environmentally conscious, very PC you might say, culturally leftist group [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1140.1s)]
*  who basically have the same kind of left of center economics as the first group [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1144.82s)]
*  but in every other respect are simply on a totally different agenda. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1151.06s)]
*  And it's almost impossible to appeal to both of those two groups at once. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1154.98s)]
*  And social democratic parties in most parts of Europe [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1159.14s)]
*  are losing their traditional working class base to the new populist politics. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1161.8600000000001s)]
*  That's what's happening now. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1166.1000000000001s)]
*  If I may I'd like to put a question to you now. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1167.3s)]
*  What I was saying, first of all, how do you see recent events in the United States [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1173.94s)]
*  as fitting into this kind of broad scenario? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1181.3s)]
*  Do you think that the kind of account I've given of populism in Europe [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1183.22s)]
*  is a good way of understanding or explaining what happened in the election [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1187.14s)]
*  last November or other trends in American politics in the last few years? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1191.54s)]
*  I think it's much more cultural and less economic than people think. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1195.78s)]
*  If you look even at a state such as West Virginia, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1199.3s)]
*  I just wrote a column about West Virginia. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  We all talk about how poor it is but per capita income in West Virginia [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1203.78s)]
*  it's about three quarters of the US national average. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1207.8600000000001s)]
*  If you take into account the fact that it's cheaper to live there [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1210.5800000000002s)]
*  it's actually not that far from the national average. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1213.46s)]
*  There are obvious problems with opioids, low labor force participation [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1217.14s)]
*  but that actually means the other people in West Virginia [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1221.3000000000002s)]
*  actually have to be awfully productive. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1224.0200000000002s)]
*  That per capita income in West Virginia in real terms [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1226.2600000000002s)]
*  is about equal to that of France or Japan. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1229.46s)]
*  Now those are poorer countries than the United States [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1232.18s)]
*  but if your theory is all about the extreme poverty of West Virginia [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1236.0200000000002s)]
*  and the state is falling apart when in fact it's been growing a bit [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1239.22s)]
*  it's gained 50,000 residents over the last 15 years. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1242.5s)]
*  Not a lot but it's not being massively depopulated. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1245.62s)]
*  Your theory is they're all opting for Trump or populism or alt-right [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1248.74s)]
*  because they're so poor. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1252.9s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1254.42s)]
*  I think there's increased sorting of this country by education [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1256.58s)]
*  and what is sometimes called a coastal elites phenomenon [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1261.22s)]
*  though you find it in Ann Arbor and Austin, Texas [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1264.02s)]
*  and some places that aren't the coasts. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1267.06s)]
*  I think part of it is because of the internet. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1269.3799999999999s)]
*  There is a split of sympathy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1272.74s)]
*  So say parents rather they might have once said [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1275.7s)]
*  I don't want my daughter to marry an ex, some ethnic or racial group [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1279.7s)]
*  and now it's I don't want my daughter to marry a Republican [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1283.46s)]
*  is a much stronger sentiment. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1286.6599999999999s)]
*  And parts of the country are realizing they should rebel against that. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1289.22s)]
*  I don't feel they're doing so in an especially effective way [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1293.22s)]
*  but that's what I think is happening here. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1296.98s)]
*  There is slow wage growth and that creates grievances [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1299.46s)]
*  where expectations are not met and that feeds into the cultural problems [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1304.34s)]
*  but I think also in Europe it's very often a more cultural thing. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1308.9s)]
*  So Spain has relatively recent fascism so they're somewhat inoculated [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1314.26s)]
*  because there's been a lot of immigration to Spain. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1319.1399999999999s)]
*  Ireland didn't have fascism but it had the issue obviously a lot of violence. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1321.3799999999999s)]
*  So the idea that some kind of alt-right view comes along [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1326.1000000000001s)]
*  that sort of flirts with the idea of being violent on Twitter, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1329.7s)]
*  it's not going to be a big seller in Ireland [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1332.1000000000001s)]
*  and I think it's really history being recreated in different places [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1334.18s)]
*  and different ways. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1338.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I tend to agree very much with that actually [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1339.3s)]
*  and what I then ask you further is well you say that [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1341.54s)]
*  and I agree with you as I say that the economics is not what's really driving this. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1347.8600000000001s)]
*  It's more a cultural phenomenon. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1352.26s)]
*  But on the other hand how do you think politics is reacting to something [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1354.1s)]
*  you've been writing about for a while now [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1360.8999999999999s)]
*  which is what you see as the stagnation of innovation, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1363.2199999999998s)]
*  the problems of lack of income growth for large parts of society. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1366.02s)]
*  What effects do you think this is having on the broader kind of political media [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1370.26s)]
*  that we're living in? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  I would just say we have so much debt and have some high implicit liabilities [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1376.26s)]
*  and furthermore we're committed to paying off interest groups [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1380.82s)]
*  that we're actually now at a margin. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1383.86s)]
*  We can't do that for everyone now. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1385.54s)]
*  So you have Republicans controlling every branch of government. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1387.9399999999998s)]
*  They can't agree on tax reform. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1390.58s)]
*  They can't agree on how to alter Obamacare, at least not yet [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1392.1799999999998s)]
*  and those are signs. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1395.86s)]
*  It's not really gridlock in the 2011 sense [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1397.1399999999999s)]
*  but we don't have the resources to make deals by paying off the complainers [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1399.86s)]
*  and so on all sides a lot of parties are ceasing to cooperate [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1404.26s)]
*  and it's more kind of incoherence than a gridlock [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1408.02s)]
*  but with that we must end and thank you all for listening. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bkb-BEVV_E&t=1410.26s)]
