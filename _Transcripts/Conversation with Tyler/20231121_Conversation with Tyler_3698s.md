Esther Duflo’s advice to students? Spend time in the field. “It's only through this exposure that you can learn how wrong most of your intuitions are and preconceptions are,” she explains. For Duflo, it was time spent in the Soviet Union on the brink of collapse. While there she saw how Jeff Sachs used the tools of economics to advise policymakers on matters of crucial importance. To her it seemed like the best job in the world—and she began to pursue it in earnest. Now it is she who is advising governments on how best to reduce poverty, having co-founded one of the leading policy research centers in the world. That work, together with that of frequent collaborators Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer, has now been honored with the Nobel Prize.  
 
She joined Tyler to discuss that work, including how coaching increases the effectiveness of cash transfers, why she cautions against falling in love with growth rates, what France gets right about child-rearing, the management philosophy behind her success building J-PAL, how she briefly became the face of an anti-Soviet revolution, the under-looked reasons behind the decline of geographic mobility in the United States, what rock climbing can teach us about being a good empirical economist, her daily musical move from Bach to Bob Dylan, and more.

# Esther Duflo on Management, Growth, and Research in Action | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM)
*  Hi everyone, this is Tyler of Conversations with Tyler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=0.0s)]
*  I hope you've enjoyed listening to and learning from this year's conversations as much as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=7.16s)]
*  I have. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=11.92s)]
*  For me, it's the single most rewarding and instructive thing I do. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=12.92s)]
*  This year, some of my absolute favorites have been, for instance, Neil Stevenson talking [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=16.92s)]
*  about science fiction, the future, and innovation, Masha Gessen on Russia and Putin and the history [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  of communism. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=28.26s)]
*  Russ Roberts on market economics, Karl Knausgaard on Norway, Henrik Ibsen, Norwegian art, Emily [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=29.64s)]
*  Wilson on the ancient Greeks, the classics, and Homer's Odyssey. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=38.0s)]
*  If you've benefited from this podcast and enjoyed it, please consider making a financial [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=43.04s)]
*  contribution before the end of the year at conversationswithtyler.com slash donate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=47.58s)]
*  All donations will go to the production of the show, including, first, new conversations [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=55.84s)]
*  every other week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=60.84s)]
*  And note that unlike most other podcasts, we often have to pay to travel to our guests [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=62.02s)]
*  and we have never done a remote interview. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=67.08s)]
*  Second, live shows in Arlington, Virginia, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  and more locales to come. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  Third, full readable transcripts of every episode enhanced with helpful links. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=78.0s)]
*  For me, doing Conversations with Tyler is about learning from other people and teaching [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=83.6s)]
*  other people how to learn. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=89.16s)]
*  And that's what I try to do in each episode, is to show how listening and asking good questions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  produces knowledge and how that can help make the world a wiser place. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=97.0s)]
*  So, if you believe in the power of learning through listening and reading, as I do, please [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=101.84s)]
*  support the podcast at conversationswithtyler.com slash donate. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=107.18s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=113.94000000000001s)]
*  Today, I'm very honored to be here with Esther Duflo, who recently has won a Nobel Prize [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=137.18s)]
*  in Economics, the youngest economics winner ever. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=151.12s)]
*  And today, our date of recording is also, I believe, the publication date for her new [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=154.36s)]
*  book with Abhijit Banerjee, and that is called Good Economics for Hard Times. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=158.8s)]
*  Esther, welcome. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=163.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=164.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=165.36s)]
*  My first question has to do with what I think is maybe your most important paper, and that's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=166.82000000000002s)]
*  the 2015 paper in Science with Abhijit, Dean Carlin, and some other co-authors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=171.46s)]
*  And there you show that a cash transfer to the very poor combined with training and coaching [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=176.18s)]
*  has super high rates of return. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=181.18s)]
*  Why don't people study that more? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=183.06s)]
*  It seems to be the most potent intervention we have to fight poverty other than migration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  So I think it has been studied a lot, and it has also been adopted as policy after this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  original study and other studies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  So the original project comes from Bangladesh, and there actually has been a study and a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=198.4s)]
*  long-run study in Bangladesh by Robin Burgess and others who are now looking at a household's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=204.36s)]
*  tenure hands. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=210.36s)]
*  And you continue to see large differences between the households who got the transfer. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  And they have a recent paper that they just released to say that they continue to study [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=216.86s)]
*  it where they are really putting a lot of theory into it to look at the data through [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=220.24s)]
*  the lens of asking, actually, is there a poverty trap in which some of these households have [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=224.66s)]
*  fallen? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=230.01999999999998s)]
*  And they show that, in fact, there is such a thing with a threshold of wealth above which, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=231.01999999999998s)]
*  if households can go above, they can grow to a point where they are significantly better [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=236.5s)]
*  off. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=240.61999999999998s)]
*  And if they are below it, they go back to wherever they came from. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=241.61999999999998s)]
*  So I think that's a very important paper that is making a big splash and shows people continue. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  And in our case, the part of the study that I was the most involved with was in West Bengal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=249.77999999999997s)]
*  And we also continue to study them after 10 years. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=254.76s)]
*  We are studying their children as well. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=257.28s)]
*  We are studying the impact on migration to go through not just, oh, there is an effect, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=259.52s)]
*  but how all of these effects are kind of building on each other. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=264.76s)]
*  As I understand the paper, there's a cost-benefit ratio of 133% to 433% across six countries. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=269.2s)]
*  And that's enormous. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  What exactly about the mentor makes the difference as opposed to just giving people cash? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  What is the mentor or the coach actually teaching? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=283.06s)]
*  So just from the experiment, this particular experiment, it would be hard to tell because [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=285.64s)]
*  one could say, well, you should try to do cash only and then we can see. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=289.36s)]
*  But subsequently, Abhijit and Dean Carlin were involved in an experiment in Ghana where [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=293.52s)]
*  they just gave goods. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=298.68s)]
*  So they call it a good drop paper, just goods were given and without the coaching. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=300.16s)]
*  And there they find very clearly that the coaching makes a big difference, that people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  who you give just the assets to have more assets, but it doesn't serve as a springboard [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=311.18s)]
*  for more activities. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=316.74s)]
*  So descriptively, what the coach do is two things. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=317.90000000000003s)]
*  Number one is avoid the temptation of liquidating the assets quite early. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=322.18s)]
*  So if you give people cows and they don't feel confident using them, then the easiest [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  thing to do is to sell them and then they have cash, but they don't have the productive [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=332.3s)]
*  asset anymore. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=336.54s)]
*  The second thing is to provide the necessary, the complimentary human capital for taking [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=338.14s)]
*  care of your assets. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=344.4s)]
*  So for example, when people are giving cash, some people are given cash to start a petty [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=345.56s)]
*  business, but they have no idea even how to go to the market because the poorest person [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=349.88s)]
*  in the village are also excluded from productive activities. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=356.68s)]
*  They have not really been working or if they have been working inside, made in very local [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=361.36s)]
*  circumstances, they really have no idea. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=365.68s)]
*  So the coaches are physically taking them to the market. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=368.12s)]
*  Like this is how you take the bus and this is where you buy the trinkets that you're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=371.14s)]
*  going to send to the village and this is where, you know, how you bargain for your trinkets [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=375.06s)]
*  and then come back with a trinket and sell them. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=378.62s)]
*  So there is an amount of technical skills, if you will. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=380.9s)]
*  And the third component, which is harder to quantify, but probably very important as well, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=384.68s)]
*  is confidence training. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=390.86s)]
*  So they are meeting in groups and those are people who've not been involved in productive [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=392.46s)]
*  activities often, living of alms or very petty works, and they are making them kind [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=398.0s)]
*  of confident that they can do it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=405.68s)]
*  And how scalable is the coaching in your opinion? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=407.88s)]
*  That's a good question to which we should have an answer soonish because there is now [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=409.84s)]
*  scale up of these programs in various countries and in particular in India. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=416.08s)]
*  Some state governments in India are scaling this up as part of their program. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=421.26s)]
*  So they are mainstreaming it as part of their program, still with the support of the original [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=427.3s)]
*  microfinance institutions that have been running this program, but hiring many, many, many [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=432.56s)]
*  people. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=437.8s)]
*  So you will be able to see whether this was, you know, you could do this with like the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=438.8s)]
*  best NGO worker of the country and you only have hundreds of those and then that's done [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  or whether this is something that can be spread. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=448.18s)]
*  What is encouraging in this respect is that in Bangladesh, the program is huge as it is. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=451.54s)]
*  It's enormous. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=457.48s)]
*  It reaches hundreds of thousands of families as it is. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=458.48s)]
*  So to some extent, we already have the answer to how scalable it is because it's already [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=461.48s)]
*  scaled. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  And even the evaluation by Robin Burgess and others was done on a quite large scale. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  Have you ever thought you should just spend the rest of your career working on this intervention [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=473.68s)]
*  and 5% of the economics profession should just work on this with possible rates of return [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=477.9s)]
*  so high for the world's biggest problem, which is poverty, right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=483.06s)]
*  Why don't we do much, much more of working on this problem, on this study? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=486.82s)]
*  One should certainly continue to do more working on this study and working on the questions [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=491.78s)]
*  you were asking about the scale up and working on how various modalities of it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=496.74s)]
*  Already the study you mentioned in science was already a sign that there is at least [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=502.32s)]
*  some interest in the economics profession to focus on this question because it was the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=507.84s)]
*  second paper on this. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=512.56s)]
*  The first paper was the evaluation of the mothership program in Bangladesh and people [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=514.4399999999999s)]
*  didn't say, oh, that's a nice program. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=519.0s)]
*  Let's go and study something new. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=521.72s)]
*  Instead Dean Kallen led a group of people to replicate this same evaluation in seven [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=524.64s)]
*  different countries, which was a very major undertaking involving lots and lots of researchers [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=529.6999999999999s)]
*  and NGOs. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=535.14s)]
*  The fact that people were willing to do that, to write 12-page paper in science at the end [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=536.3s)]
*  of it, suggests that there is really a recognition that it's a very important topic. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=543.3s)]
*  Now, should everybody do that? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=548.3s)]
*  Well, I guess there are probably diminishing returns to effort on the particular problems [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=551.54s)]
*  and there are other interesting problems to look at. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=558.54s)]
*  So I'm glad that people continue working on this and I think the work is only going to [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  deepen both on understanding the mechanism better, understanding variations around it [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=566.48s)]
*  and understanding how to make it adopted as policy because I completely agree with you [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=572.0s)]
*  that of everything that I've done, studied in my life, that this is one with the most [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=575.8s)]
*  important, spectacular results. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=580.88s)]
*  You have some well-known papers with co-authors about microcredit programs in Hyderabad, India, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=583.36s)]
*  and I've long had some questions about how those programs actually work. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=588.3s)]
*  So as you know, often the borrowing families are paying annualized rates of 50 to 100 percent [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=591.86s)]
*  a year and they keep on borrowing. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=596.94s)]
*  They're not just borrowing once to bring the kid to the doctor. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=598.46s)]
*  They're in a steady borrowing program and at the same time, they're not just drained [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=601.24s)]
*  of all their wealth. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=605.32s)]
*  So does that imply there are rates of return on investment in those communities of 50 to [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=606.32s)]
*  100 percent a year? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=610.94s)]
*  And if that's true, why aren't the growth rates higher? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=612.8s)]
*  You get my question? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=615.0600000000001s)]
*  How does the whole thing fit together? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, it actually does not imply that because the plurality of this household, maybe the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=617.76s)]
*  majority of these households, does not actually invest in any productive activity with the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=622.14s)]
*  money. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  So most of the interest are paid from people's regular jobs. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  But don't they just get drained dry if I borrow it every year at 80 percent? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  It's not the same households that keep borrowing and borrowing and borrowing. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=636.8s)]
*  In fact, the number of repeat customers is less than you might think. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  People join microfinance, take a loan, buy something. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  It can be like a durable good, for example, like a fridge or a cycle, and then use their [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=648.54s)]
*  regular income to repay it. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=653.9799999999999s)]
*  So for some household, that's a very, very expensive way to save in some sense because [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=656.66s)]
*  what they're looking for is accumulating enough money to buy this durable good that they want [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=662.74s)]
*  for their household. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=667.54s)]
*  But it's very difficult to save because there are no saving instruments and there are a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  lot of temptations, et cetera. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=674.5999999999999s)]
*  So the microcredit officer serves as a kind of a commitment device. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  Once you've bought the money and the incentive of the credit officer is very strongly to [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=683.16s)]
*  make sure that everybody reimburses, then that will kind of create a way for you to [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=687.7199999999999s)]
*  get your assets and then progressively reimburse. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=695.0s)]
*  So that's kind of a funny way to save, but I think it's a reasonable response in the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=697.76s)]
*  environment. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=703.78s)]
*  And then there are some people who are borrowing for business. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=704.78s)]
*  And we have a recent paper where we look at the same setting again, but now eight years [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=708.86s)]
*  after microfinance was introduced and in fact, two years after it's gone because there was [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=713.74s)]
*  a huge crisis of microfinance. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=718.3s)]
*  And we look at the group of people who had a business before microcredit even got in. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=720.86s)]
*  So there are people who actually borrowed to invest in their business often. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=726.46s)]
*  And for those guys, we actually see that some of these people actually have very, very high [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=731.0s)]
*  rates. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  So there are some people with very high rates of returns, as you were saying, 50% or 60%. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=736.8000000000001s)]
*  So first of all, they are not very money and they are not necessarily the one that have [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=743.12s)]
*  access to money. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=746.88s)]
*  And that's kind of one of the big reasons why the growth is lower is that there is a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=747.88s)]
*  mismatch between the investment opportunity and who has the money. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=753.4599999999999s)]
*  And that's what microeconomics called misallocation. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  Your randomized control trials, they're very large. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=760.48s)]
*  They employ large numbers of people. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=762.8s)]
*  I even once visited the Hyderabad project, was very impressed how much was going on. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=764.6s)]
*  Do you have a personal philosophy of management or leadership? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  Eslou Flo, the manager, not the economist. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about her. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=775.1s)]
*  So I kind of stumbled onto this because I was most academic. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=777.0s)]
*  I was not born to be a manager. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=781.52s)]
*  So I don't have a, you know, I didn't bring a pre-made philosophy to this business, but [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=783.6s)]
*  I developed one and it has several elements to it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=789.4s)]
*  But the key is that I'm not a micromanager. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=793.92s)]
*  The key is that you want to give people pretty clear vision of where we're heading and then [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=798.1999999999999s)]
*  give them a lot of ownership for how we are getting there. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=806.92s)]
*  And that is true for the whole organization of J-PAL, which is the sum total, the network [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=810.16s)]
*  of all these researchers where from the very beginning with the first executive director, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=816.68s)]
*  Rachel Klenester, it was really her thing to lead and she put her mark to it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  And we were kind of behind as kind of enabler. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=828.98s)]
*  So that's true at that level. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=833.28s)]
*  That's still true today, I think. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=834.6s)]
*  And it's true at the smaller level of the project where everybody has a piece that they [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=835.98s)]
*  own and they run with it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=841.94s)]
*  And you know, they'll make mistakes and then we have to correct the mistakes. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=845.74s)]
*  But the ownership of the piece of the project means that you get a lot of effort and a lot [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=851.38s)]
*  of creativity of everyone. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=855.98s)]
*  that I'm in a very good business for no credit to me, because the people who get attracted [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=859.14s)]
*  to this work tend to be very committed and kind of passion driven. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=867.34s)]
*  So you get very good material to start with. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=873.3s)]
*  So you just need to give them a little bit of guidance and they move. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=875.34s)]
*  And which is the input that's the factor of production that prevents you from scaling [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=879.06s)]
*  your work more? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=883.6s)]
*  Well, I think it is scaled quite a bit. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=885.36s)]
*  But you're not doing 5X of what you're doing, right? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=889.24s)]
*  Something stops you. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=891.6s)]
*  It could be money, it could be talent. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=892.6s)]
*  I always try to be behind the money. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=894.16s)]
*  So I think a lot of problems of some centers, sometimes in academia, is you get some money [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=897.74s)]
*  to do something and then you have to, you know, the idea to match the money. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  We were always had some idea before and the money comes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=907.8000000000001s)]
*  So at some level the money is always the constraining factor at any point in time. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=912.16s)]
*  Now you could say why don't you get more talent to get more money, but there are some limits [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=919.0s)]
*  to that. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  Another thing is I'm not sure I'm aiming at world conquest in the sense that I'm more [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=923.3199999999999s)]
*  interested in, and I think that really much applied to the three of us. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=929.6s)]
*  We were very much interested in creating an ecosystem where that kind of work becomes [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=934.22s)]
*  easier because policymakers are interested, funders are interested, talent is interested, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=942.4200000000001s)]
*  and because there are some things that are eased. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=949.14s)]
*  Like when we started even the Hyderabad project we visited, we were kind of still learning [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=952.02s)]
*  as we went and we made mistakes. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=956.98s)]
*  And we're still making mistakes, but fewer now because there is an infrastructure and [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=958.98s)]
*  some learnings and this infrastructure can then be given to other younger people that [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=963.98s)]
*  have more imaginative great ideas to run with. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=969.14s)]
*  So I've kind of always been more interested in doing that and using my own work as a little [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=973.34s)]
*  bit of a testing ground, trying new things that are quite risky because it doesn't matter [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=979.62s)]
*  to me if that fails. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=984.1800000000001s)]
*  I have done it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=985.54s)]
*  Do you worry much that the RCT method, it centralizes authority in too few institutions? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=987.46s)]
*  So you need a certain amount of money, you need some managerial ability, you need connections [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=993.64s)]
*  abroad. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=997.76s)]
*  It's not like running regressions, everyone can do it on their PC. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=998.76s)]
*  Is that in some way going to slow down science? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1001.38s)]
*  So you get more reliable results, but there's just much less competition of ideas it seems. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1003.66s)]
*  I think it would be the case if we had not been mindful of this problem from the beginning. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1008.72s)]
*  And it might still be the case to some extent, but I actually think that we've put a lot [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1013.52s)]
*  of effort in avoiding it to be the case. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1019.12s)]
*  So when you take an organization like J-PAL, just in India we have 200 staff members and [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1021.94s)]
*  we have at any given time, a thousand people running surveys. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1027.88s)]
*  They are not running, I say we, but these people are not running my project. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1032.24s)]
*  These people are running the projects of dozens and dozens of researchers. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1036.18s)]
*  And when I started, I couldn't have started without having the backing of MIT because [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1040.8600000000001s)]
*  It was such a risky proposition that you needed to be able to easy risk capital kind of things. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1047.44s)]
*  But at this point, because of this infrastructure, it's much more normal science. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1054.3s)]
*  People can get in with no funding of their own, in part because one of the things we [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1058.8400000000001s)]
*  are doing as a network is raising a lot of money to redistribute to other people widely. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1064.74s)]
*  J-PAL has 400 researchers that are affiliated to it or invited researchers, many of them [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1071.14s)]
*  quite quite junior. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1077.1000000000001s)]
*  So that sort of makes the, I think it was very important to us and I think we've been [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1079.3000000000002s)]
*  quite successful at it, at making the tool more generally available. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1084.4s)]
*  It's never going to be like running a regression from your computer. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1089.8600000000001s)]
*  But my philosophy is that if you have the drive and you're willing to put in your own [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1093.38s)]
*  sweat equity, you can do it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1099.3s)]
*  And our students and many other students who are not in top institutions are doing it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1101.38s)]
*  In your book, the new book, Good Economics for Hard Times, you talk quite a bit about [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1105.58s)]
*  a revolt against the elites in the United States. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1109.9s)]
*  But what if I say, well, the elites are underrated, they're pretty good. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1112.38s)]
*  Who else runs RCTs other than the elites? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1116.18s)]
*  I mean, what's your response? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1118.42s)]
*  Do you side with the revolt or you side with the elites? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1120.18s)]
*  So first of all, I think that it's good if it's not just the elite who are running RCTs. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1122.7s)]
*  So back to my point of trying to make it a general tool, that's the elite of the kind [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1127.14s)]
*  of academic movement. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1132.94s)]
*  But you could say, well, they are still academics. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1134.14s)]
*  So in the broad scheme of things, they are still the elite. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1135.8200000000002s)]
*  So my problem is not with the elite. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1138.0600000000002s)]
*  My problem is with the attitude of the elite with respect to everyone else. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1140.22s)]
*  I don't even know what elite means in this context. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1144.26s)]
*  But if as an economist, as a profession, spend more time trying to understand what are the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1146.3200000000002s)]
*  people who do not have, say, the comfort of an academic career behind them, then we can [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1152.38s)]
*  make progress in understanding the issues and therefore potentially in thinking through [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1158.0200000000002s)]
*  policies that might help solve these issues. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1163.2600000000002s)]
*  So it would be a bit hypocritical of me to be against the elite, given that I am like [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1165.5s)]
*  the elite of the elite in some sense, like from when I was born. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1171.14s)]
*  It's a type of problem that you choose to put your attention on that matters. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  In your new book, you seem at times quite skeptical about how well economists can understand [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1178.46s)]
*  what drives economic growth. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1183.46s)]
*  But what if I just looked at a few cases? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1185.72s)]
*  I looked at, say, Singapore, Ireland, Poland, which have done remarkably well in the last [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1187.58s)]
*  few decades. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1193.14s)]
*  And in each case, you had leaders who more or less followed the prescriptions of economics. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1194.3400000000001s)]
*  They had the will or the ability to do so. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1199.14s)]
*  I watched all of those experiments unfold. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1201.5s)]
*  I felt they were going to do pretty well. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1203.78s)]
*  They did extremely well, actually better than I thought. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1205.98s)]
*  Don't we in fact have a pretty good idea of what does drive growth? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1208.9s)]
*  It might be different for each country, but you go to a country, you look at it, you have [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1211.7s)]
*  a good sense. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1215.9s)]
*  Many countries have done it and it's worked. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1217.02s)]
*  Why is that wrong? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1218.82s)]
*  Well, then I could give you South Korea. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1219.82s)]
*  And it did pretty well too with an entirely different set of policies. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1225.22s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1228.74s)]
*  Policies can be different. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1229.74s)]
*  But given a country, it seems the leaders can know. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1231.16s)]
*  And if they have the will to do it, it happens. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1233.72s)]
*  Well, if the policies are very different from one country to the other and are a complicated [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1235.78s)]
*  function of the context. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1243.3s)]
*  And in Ireland, you need very low tax rates. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1245.6599999999999s)]
*  But in South Korea, you need industrial policy. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1249.56s)]
*  That a little bit reflects our difficulty as economists to have come up with guidance [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1253.1s)]
*  for the next place. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1259.3799999999999s)]
*  Because the next, you take, I don't know, Ethiopia and they want to grow. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1261.46s)]
*  The question becomes, do we have anything in the experience of the past country that [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1265.26s)]
*  will help us for sure predict the set of steps that Ethiopia needs to take that is going [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1269.94s)]
*  to lead them to grow? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1275.6200000000001s)]
*  My firm belief is that we don't. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1277.3s)]
*  But if you do then, you have a side gig to help in Ethiopia and that would be great. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1279.26s)]
*  But Ethiopia has grown about 10% for 10 years running. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1285.5s)]
*  They invest about 38% of their GDP. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1288.62s)]
*  It may collapse for political reasons. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1291.6599999999999s)]
*  But if they stay on the track they're on, isn't that further evidence that they figured [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1294.2199999999998s)]
*  out what they need to do to grow? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1297.9399999999998s)]
*  They had the will to implement it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  So far it's working, politics allowing. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1301.58s)]
*  That's why I picked Ethiopia, because in a sense they have. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1304.1s)]
*  So again, they have their own path. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1306.6599999999999s)]
*  But like the thing is, their own path becomes so particular. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1308.58s)]
*  I'm not saying that good policymaking is not feasible, because we have lots of examples [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1311.82s)]
*  of good policymaking and lots of examples of bad policymaking actually. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1315.98s)]
*  But the good policymaking is so varied that at a scientific level it becomes very quickly [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1319.8600000000001s)]
*  good things are good. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1325.34s)]
*  Because the path of Ethiopia, even how the steps that they had to take to carve out a [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1327.6200000000001s)]
*  place in international trade, for example, is very different from what a country like [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1335.74s)]
*  China had to do just by virtue of China existing, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1340.42s)]
*  So I'm certainly not saying that good policymaking is not feasible. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1345.36s)]
*  I'm just saying that we haven't found, it seems to me, empirically, we haven't found [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1348.3999999999999s)]
*  like a series of prescriptions that we could give to countries saying if you do this thing [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1353.76s)]
*  it's going to work out. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1359.24s)]
*  And similarly now, growth is slowing down in India. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1360.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't think, at least I wouldn't know what to tell them what to do, like what they are [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1365.84s)]
*  supposed to do now. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1371.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think they also, I don't think themselves know. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1372.3999999999999s)]
*  So that's kind of what has turned out to be difficult empirically. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1375.16s)]
*  This is not me, actually. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1379.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm not a macroeconomist. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1380.3200000000002s)]
*  So I would not like have the arrogance to say that we haven't figured it out. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1381.68s)]
*  But that seems to be what the macroeconomists have, the conclusions they've come to is that [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1386.44s)]
*  they haven't gotten like a set of recommendations, even context-dependent recommendations that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1391.2s)]
*  they can kind of run with. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1396.6000000000001s)]
*  As you well know, there's a number of papers that suggest human capital is a factor of [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1399.16s)]
*  overriding importance for economic growth. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1403.48s)]
*  I think Mancu, while in Rome, attribute 80% of growth to human capital. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1405.88s)]
*  What's your view of those theories? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1410.68s)]
*  As a growth accounting matter, which is what fraction does differences, what's the correlation [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1412.88s)]
*  between how much of the growth is explained by differences in human capital across country. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1419.28s)]
*  It does seem to be that human capital play a big role, even though the Mancu-Roman figures [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1425.3600000000001s)]
*  have gone down since then with the work of Caseli, for example. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1431.12s)]
*  But it is important. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1434.9199999999998s)]
*  Some of it is correlation rather than causal effects, that countries that have been good [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1436.1999999999998s)]
*  at increasing education have been good at doing other things. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1441.4399999999998s)]
*  Also countries that have grown fast also generate an incentive to invest in education. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1445.04s)]
*  That's all people by Bill St. Clair now that kind of nicely makes this point. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1450.4799999999998s)]
*  The bottom line is that I'm totally ready to believe that human capital, broadly defined [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1455.04s)]
*  education in particular, plays a big role in growth. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1462.28s)]
*  To tell you the truth, even if it didn't, then it's not a big bet to invest in education [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1466.24s)]
*  anyway because worse come to worse, people would be educated, which seems to be a good [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1472.72s)]
*  means to an end. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1476.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a good end in itself, it's not just a means to an end. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1477.1599999999999s)]
*  But then the question becomes. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1480.56s)]
*  I will kind of totally go with this impression that human capital is super important. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1482.2s)]
*  In fact, it is what I think was the original impulse of Michael Kramer when he worked on [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1486.64s)]
*  the first RCTs. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  It was coming from growth. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1494.3600000000001s)]
*  He thought, wow, human capital plays a big role in growth. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1495.8400000000001s)]
*  Now what's human capital? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1500.16s)]
*  Once you said education is important, you have to start unpacking this question. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1501.96s)]
*  Is it years of education? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1506.68s)]
*  Well, not really. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1507.68s)]
*  Clearly, if kids learn nothing, it's not so useful, so it has to be learning. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1508.68s)]
*  Then you can start asking yourself questions, or whether it's like cognitive skills or non-cognitive [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1514.0s)]
*  skills or a mix of the two. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1518.92s)]
*  Say like Heckman is telling us that non-cognitive skills is such a very important part of human [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1521.64s)]
*  capital. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1526.3600000000001s)]
*  Then you want to ask yourself the question, well, how do cognitive skills get produced? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1527.3600000000001s)]
*  How non-cognitive skills get produced? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1532.44s)]
*  That's what willy-nilly lends you to much more specific policy advice and hence potentially [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1534.8799999999999s)]
*  things that you can start running RCT on. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1544.04s)]
*  To return to what I think was your master's thesis, how well did the USSR's first five-year [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1546.68s)]
*  plan go? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1551.68s)]
*  Well, this was actually my master's thesis in history. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1552.68s)]
*  I was interested in the time in propaganda. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1558.1599999999999s)]
*  Not so much the first five-year plan per se, but how over this period the talk and the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1563.8s)]
*  use in propaganda of the big construction sites evolved. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1570.76s)]
*  This is also the period where Stalin consolidated power. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1576.48s)]
*  At the beginning, there was a lot of ways that the Soviet Union could have gone. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1583.8s)]
*  It could have gone more market-friendly way, which is sort of what Lenin was hoping at [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1588.8s)]
*  some point. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1594.6s)]
*  It was going a completely Ethiopian, everybody lived together kind of crazy way. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1596.36s)]
*  Then there was the Stalin thing, which took finally the form that they adopted, which [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1601.36s)]
*  was sort of boring, inefficient dirigism. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1607.04s)]
*  All of this played out in how they represented their construction sites, like the big dam [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1612.56s)]
*  on the Dnieper. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1617.72s)]
*  This is how both economics and the narrative about economics were used to consolidate power [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1619.8s)]
*  and to consolidate grip on society. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1629.16s)]
*  You didn't like economics at first, I read in one interview. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1632.4s)]
*  Why not? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1635.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1636.0s)]
*  What soured you on it? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1637.52s)]
*  I was exposed to the typical econ 101 course, the French version of it, with the difference [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1639.16s)]
*  curve and all that jazz. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1646.2s)]
*  I thought it had no relevance, that it was so far removed from any real person's life [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1650.24s)]
*  that it could not possibly be useful. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1658.92s)]
*  I also was skeptical that it was extremely ideological, that if you want to show that [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1661.3600000000001s)]
*  minimum wage is bad, then it's very easy to write a supply demand curve and horizontal [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1669.8s)]
*  line. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1674.24s)]
*  But, you know, lo and behold, minimum wage is bad and redistribution perverts incentives. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1675.24s)]
*  I thought the conclusions were a little bit too directly coming from the assumptions that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1681.2s)]
*  were put in. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1688.32s)]
*  I had only done economics initially because I wanted to do economic history. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1690.64s)]
*  Then I thought, okay, I'm done with this whole economics business. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1695.72s)]
*  At the same time, I was a little bit dissatisfied with history for different reasons, in particular [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1698.84s)]
*  because I thought it's not very immediately useful. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1704.8s)]
*  That's why I decided to go to Russia under the pretext of writing my master thesis, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1709.48s)]
*  but really to get some exposure to the world. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1713.56s)]
*  This is when I saw Economist in Action because I was the research assistant of the research [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1717.32s)]
*  assistant of Jeff Sachs, whom I never met on this occasion, but I was kind of hustling [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1723.6s)]
*  for them. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1729.48s)]
*  I didn't necessarily agree with everything they were doing, but I thought that they had [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1730.48s)]
*  the luxury to think about things and then to be heard by policymakers when they had [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1735.68s)]
*  something to say. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1741.04s)]
*  I said, wow, this is like the best job in the world. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1742.04s)]
*  I still think that. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1744.92s)]
*  On the internet, there's a photo of a teenage esoter du flow. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1745.92s)]
*  At least it looks like you protesting against fascism in Russia. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1749.0s)]
*  On top of a tank, is it? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1752.8s)]
*  That was a bus. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1754.1200000000001s)]
*  A bus. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1755.1200000000001s)]
*  It was me. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1756.1200000000001s)]
*  It was me. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1757.1200000000001s)]
*  That was in 1991. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1758.1200000000001s)]
*  This is not when I lived one year there. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1759.12s)]
*  I lived one year in 1993, 1994. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1762.08s)]
*  But this was in 1991. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1764.6s)]
*  I had gone to Russia about every year since I was a teen to learn Russian. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1765.84s)]
*  I happened to be there the summer where there was this putsch against Gorbachev. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1773.2399999999998s)]
*  That's the year my wife left as a refugee. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1779.6799999999998s)]
*  That summer. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1784.0s)]
*  We actually watched TV. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1785.0s)]
*  I do remember those GECAGEP, they were called fascist communists. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1787.84s)]
*  Half dead, half copied, half dead. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1794.44s)]
*  Making the coup. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1797.88s)]
*  We were a bit shocked. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1798.88s)]
*  With my friend, we decided that we would go out in town to see what's happening. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1802.6s)]
*  We went. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1808.08s)]
*  We went towards the White House and we couldn't see very well because there were a lot of [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1811.48s)]
*  people. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1816.44s)]
*  We saw this trolley and I said, let's go up. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1817.44s)]
*  We are going to have a good view of what's going on. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1819.64s)]
*  We went to the top of the trolley. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1824.24s)]
*  It was amazing because there was an immediate fraternization of the troops and the people. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1825.96s)]
*  In retrospect, it was not a very reasonable thing to do. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1833.28s)]
*  At the time, it sounded like a completely happy moment. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1837.0s)]
*  There was a truck that was delivering bread. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1840.92s)]
*  It was the end of communism. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1844.28s)]
*  Someone gave me that fascism near Prahidiot, a placard, and asked me to hold it. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1846.84s)]
*  I was like, sure, I'm going to hold it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1852.36s)]
*  I'm holding my placard. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1853.96s)]
*  We stayed there for a long time when things were happening. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1855.48s)]
*  Next time I saw in the evening, my parents called me and said, what are you doing? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1858.36s)]
*  It turns out that that image was on all the TV in the world. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1863.6s)]
*  That's how I very briefly became the face of this revolution. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1867.48s)]
*  That photo was then in a book. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1874.1599999999999s)]
*  The guy never knew who I was. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1876.6s)]
*  Recently, he put two and two together. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1879.24s)]
*  Other than missing your family, what was the hardest thing about living in Russia for a [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1882.56s)]
*  year? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1885.8799999999999s)]
*  It was an extremely, extremely hard place to live in at that time. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1886.88s)]
*  It was extremely violent, just day to day. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1893.2800000000002s)]
*  It was the end of communism, but mafia was out there replacing it. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1899.5200000000002s)]
*  Some people were really extremely poor. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1907.0400000000002s)]
*  They were given these vouchers, but they quickly exchanged them. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1910.2s)]
*  You saw this woman queuing near the subway with one fish to sell. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1913.88s)]
*  The whole thing was so hard. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1920.0400000000002s)]
*  Everything was hard. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1922.72s)]
*  It was a difficult environment. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1924.16s)]
*  I assume it still is, but I haven't really gone back since then. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1926.16s)]
*  Do you have a favorite Russian novel? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1928.96s)]
*  My favorite Russian novel that very originally is Dostoyevsky and Crime and Punishment, probably [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1931.8000000000002s)]
*  among the... [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1938.5200000000002s)]
*  Why is the French education system so good, or would you challenge the premise? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1939.68s)]
*  The French education system is very good at producing a very small elite of very educated [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1943.84s)]
*  people and at reproducing it. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1948.8s)]
*  But productivity at the median is quite high in France, right? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1951.28s)]
*  At the median of the productivity of the median worker. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1954.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1957.12s)]
*  So it's not just training an elite. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1958.12s)]
*  Yes, although I wonder whether if we look in a generation or the current kids who are [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1960.12s)]
*  in school, we will find the same thing, because I'll tell you exactly why. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1966.4s)]
*  The current PISA and TIMSS results show France exactly at the median in terms of the scores, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1971.6s)]
*  but with a lot of heterogeneity, with excellent results at the top and really bad results [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1980.8s)]
*  at the bottom. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1985.84s)]
*  The second thing that these test scores also show, I think it's the TIMSS, the math scores, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1987.24s)]
*  is the strongest correlation of the OECD country between your socioeconomic class and your [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1991.84s)]
*  scores. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=1999.1999999999998s)]
*  So this is the place where being in the bottom quintile of socioeconomic class income, parental [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2000.2s)]
*  income, is the most predictive of being in the bottom quintile of the math performance. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2006.68s)]
*  So I do think we historically have an excellent system. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2012.8s)]
*  I do think it has roots in 19th century France and the Republic of the Teachers and both [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2015.44s)]
*  inclusive and demanding system at once. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2021.44s)]
*  And I think to some extent, I'm the product of that. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2024.32s)]
*  I also think that we've a little bit left it crumble. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2027.5600000000002s)]
*  So I do hope that we can recover it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2031.6000000000001s)]
*  Does child rearing in France strike you as more sensible than child rearing in the United [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2035.96s)]
*  States? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2040.0s)]
*  Oh, very much so. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2041.0s)]
*  And why? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2042.0s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2043.0s)]
*  You know that book, Bringing Up Baby? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2044.0s)]
*  So I think she picked up on something which is ring so true to me, which maybe is a more [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2047.0s)]
*  general point about the US versus France. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2052.44s)]
*  In France, people are reasonably content to just go with the flow and do what everybody [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2055.6s)]
*  does. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2061.7999999999997s)]
*  So every kid eats the same thing at 4.30 and has dinner at the same time and kind of has [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2062.7999999999997s)]
*  gone through the same experiences, learn the same songs and everybody thinks they are totally [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2071.72s)]
*  free but in fact, they're all on this kind of pretty sensible railroad and also they [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2078.7999999999997s)]
*  don't agonize about it. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2083.68s)]
*  In the US, child rearing is one more occasion to make a statement about your identity. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2086.2s)]
*  So you're the kind of mother that carries the baby or you're the kind of mother that [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2094.44s)]
*  put the baby in a stroller and somehow that sort of, yeah, almost can predict what you're [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2098.8799999999997s)]
*  going to think about Donald Trump. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2103.9199999999996s)]
*  And that's crazy. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2106.08s)]
*  So people are so concerned about what they do. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2108.2s)]
*  Not only they feel that they have to invest a ton in their children but also and they [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2114.3999999999996s)]
*  feel inadequate if they are not able to but also that exactly what they do kind of creates [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2118.56s)]
*  them as people. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2125.04s)]
*  So in France, that's kind of not there and I think that that makes everybody so much [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2126.04s)]
*  more laid back, children and adults. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2130.9199999999996s)]
*  Why are the biggest and best French companies all so old? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2134.08s)]
*  I think they all predate 1980 or so. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2136.88s)]
*  So that's a little bit above my pay grade. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2139.1600000000003s)]
*  Not that your other questions were not above my pay grade. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2142.6800000000003s)]
*  Or pay grade elevators at conversations with Tyler. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2145.44s)]
*  Yes, no, I appreciate that but that might be above my pay grade even with your elevator. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2148.32s)]
*  What you're going to seem to say about that and I'm just going to parrot someone like [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2155.08s)]
*  Augustin Landier is the idea that in the US, failing is quite all right. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2159.44s)]
*  Like bankruptcy is not really a problem. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2163.6800000000003s)]
*  Patilos are reasonably easy to navigate and there is not much stigma associated with failing. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2166.68s)]
*  And so people are, so there is more churn in the system and that produces a bunch of [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2175.12s)]
*  horrible companies but those die so we don't see them and that produces some good ones. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2179.96s)]
*  And the French system is less encouraging of failing and that is less conducive to lots [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2185.8799999999997s)]
*  of thousands of flowers blooming and hence there is no new things. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2194.16s)]
*  But I'm repeating something which is not deeply original and has some ring of truth but honestly [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2200.56s)]
*  I'm not going to claim expertise there. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2206.2799999999997s)]
*  What is important to you from French cinema? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2209.16s)]
*  Oh, so many things. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2211.48s)]
*  That's not above my pay grade. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2214.16s)]
*  Like there's so much inside my pay grade. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2215.16s)]
*  I grew up watching movies. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2217.8399999999997s)]
*  The French system is such that in the first two years of undergraduate you work like a [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2221.04s)]
*  mad person and then you can pretty much take vacations for the rest of your life. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2224.68s)]
*  So I decided against the rest of my life thing after going to Russia and all that. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2229.72s)]
*  But in between I had this one year where I used to go to the cinema about three or four [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2233.68s)]
*  times a week. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2239.28s)]
*  So I had a chance to get groomed in the American classic, French classic. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2240.92s)]
*  And what do you recommend to us? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2247.36s)]
*  The Nouvelle Vague is still not surpassed in a way. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2249.4799999999996s)]
*  In particular Godard, you watch Prénom Carmen and nobody has made a movie like that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2254.6s)]
*  For me it's Godard and Bresson. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2260.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I would also put Bresson in there. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2262.3599999999997s)]
*  It's just unbelievable cinema. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2266.64s)]
*  On the wall of your home in Boston, according to one newspaper, is a slogan from the 1968 [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2269.24s)]
*  Paris riots. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2274.3199999999997s)]
*  And it reads, quote, nobody ever fell in love with the growth rate. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2275.68s)]
*  It's not on the wall of my house in Boston, but it's in a book of quotes that were on [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2279.96s)]
*  the wall of Paris. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2285.04s)]
*  It's a little red book that was in my parents bookshelf, which I read as a kid and I kept [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2286.04s)]
*  in my mind that I knew we had that and was looking for. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2292.8399999999997s)]
*  It could come handy at some point. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2296.7599999999998s)]
*  And it has a lot of these quotes from 1968. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2298.2s)]
*  Some of them are more well known than others. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2301.44s)]
*  Like Sous les pavés, la plage is one of the most well known under the pavement. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2304.32s)]
*  You have the sea and then this one, which I found when we were working on the book. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2309.16s)]
*  It was kind of the epigraph of one of the first drafts of the chapter on growth. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2316.12s)]
*  Then somehow I think didn't make it in the final cut. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2323.16s)]
*  And you think we should fall in love with growth rates? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2325.68s)]
*  No, I don't think one should fall in love with growth rates. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2327.88s)]
*  The power of compound returns is remarkable, right? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2330.08s)]
*  I think one should have healthy respect for growth rates and treat them as useful companions [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2332.96s)]
*  and people that you have to make work for you. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2341.36s)]
*  So I think we should think of growth rate as, you know, chief of staff, not as things we [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2344.24s)]
*  should fall in love with. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2350.08s)]
*  And I think one issue that countries have had when they've fallen in love with growth [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2351.2s)]
*  rate per se, as opposed to why is it you want growth in the first place, is that going [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2356.68s)]
*  back to the early conversation, it's pretty hard to manipulate growth rate for politicians, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2363.0s)]
*  especially fluctuation in growth rates. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2368.2s)]
*  And therefore, if things are not going your way and you try like more and more crazy things [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2371.64s)]
*  to try to make growth come back because that's what you've fallen in love with, then you [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2378.24s)]
*  can put yourself in pretty bad corners. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2384.36s)]
*  One example is Japan, for example. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  I think they did fall in love with the growth rate instead of kind of trying to think, well, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2390.04s)]
*  you know, maybe there is a reason why the growth rate has fallen down. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2395.1600000000003s)]
*  We should be kind of comfortable with that and do the best with what we have. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2397.6400000000003s)]
*  But could Japan have done better? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2403.36s)]
*  So it grew very rapidly. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2404.94s)]
*  It caught up basically to France, then stopped at a certain frontier, short of the United [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2406.6800000000003s)]
*  States. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2411.44s)]
*  France managed its decline really quite well. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2412.44s)]
*  In per capita terms, its growth rate is okay, not spectacular. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2415.32s)]
*  Social order is at a premium. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2419.52s)]
*  What have they done wrong? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2422.76s)]
*  Well, they've put themselves a pretty big debt level, which could become a debt crisis [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2423.76s)]
*  in the making, which was kind of entirely unnecessary because when growth fell down [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2431.08s)]
*  In retrospect, of course, you always have 20-20 hindsight, but when growth fell down [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2438.4s)]
*  in Japan, there was a reason for that, which is the population was aging. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2443.2000000000003s)]
*  The working population as part, as a share of the overall population, was therefore becoming [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2448.6800000000003s)]
*  smaller. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2453.7200000000003s)]
*  So it is not surprising that there would be a slowdown in the growth of GDP per capita. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2455.04s)]
*  For a while, it was compensated by the fact that there was a lot of TFP growth, but that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2459.84s)]
*  wasn't necessarily going to come forever because we don't really know where TFP is [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2463.2s)]
*  coming from. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2468.4399999999996s)]
*  So at this point, they could have said, well, this is it. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2469.9199999999996s)]
*  Let's do exactly what you said they should do. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2474.52s)]
*  We should manage the expectations for the downfall. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2476.3599999999997s)]
*  We're already quite rich and we have good standard of living, which we could make, in [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2480.2s)]
*  a sense, even better by addressing some of the issues that still remain in the Japanese [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2484.3599999999997s)]
*  society. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2489.6s)]
*  And they did some of that, but on top of that, they also said, let's try and make growth [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2491.0s)]
*  come back. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2494.68s)]
*  And that was this sort of Canadian spending spree that I don't think have any impact on [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2495.68s)]
*  growth, but puts them in a not particularly desirable microeconomic situation at the moment. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2501.36s)]
*  Why do you think in the United States, geographic mobility has fallen so much? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2508.44s)]
*  You discuss that at length in the new book. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2512.92s)]
*  I think there are a number of reasons. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2514.96s)]
*  Some that are strictly economic, I think financial, and some that are a little bit broader. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2517.0s)]
*  So on the financial side, real estate is a big part of it. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2523.48s)]
*  And that has been documented by other people than us. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2526.8s)]
*  But you can move to the south, right? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2529.6000000000004s)]
*  There's freedom to build in the south. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2531.2000000000003s)]
*  Plenty of people move to Texas. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2533.04s)]
*  You won't move to the Bay Area, but it's a big country. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2534.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2537.28s)]
*  So that explains why people aren't moving where a lot of the jobs are, if you were. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2538.28s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2542.8s)]
*  People could decide to move 200 kilometers away, not to a city, but to another place [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2544.04s)]
*  that happens not to be shocked by a shock. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2549.04s)]
*  Now there is the issue that in places where you would expect most people to move from [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2551.76s)]
*  are places which had been hit by a comic shock, which is often clustered in nature because [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2559.44s)]
*  industry is clustered. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2566.48s)]
*  So then when a region is hit by a shock that hit not just one company when everybody else [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2568.9s)]
*  is doing fine, but kind of all the companies because everybody was doing furniture or clothing [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2575.6600000000003s)]
*  or everyone was doing something that is being replaced by robots or something like that. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2580.7000000000003s)]
*  You have a kind of equilibrium fact that then the places that are affected by the shock [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2585.54s)]
*  get hurt. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2590.9s)]
*  Then the places that are not directly affected by the shock get hurt too because the guys [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2591.9s)]
*  who were working, they are less likely to buy, guys and girls actually who were working [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2595.86s)]
*  are less likely to buy McDonald's and therefore the McDonald's wages all goes down, et cetera, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2601.3s)]
*  which then leads to a decline in the real estate prices and people find themselves underwater [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2605.58s)]
*  on their market. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2611.34s)]
*  I think that prevents mobility because at least they have a house to live in if they [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2612.82s)]
*  don't go, but if they sell their house, they have nothing to get themselves another place. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2617.82s)]
*  So that's kind of purely economic factor. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2623.1s)]
*  On top of that, I think childcare is kind of an issue because a lot of people have childcare [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2626.14s)]
*  provided by their extended family and you cannot move the entire family again, maybe [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2630.94s)]
*  due to these real estate things and then the childcare options are pretty bad in this country [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2637.22s)]
*  in general, especially for small kids. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2642.18s)]
*  Once they start going to school, it's a bit better. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2644.52s)]
*  Then those are some of the economic reasons. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2647.3399999999997s)]
*  I also think they are one social reasons, which is people like to be part of a social [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2650.38s)]
*  network. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2656.94s)]
*  I think it's profoundly human that we are not meant to be lonely. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2657.94s)]
*  We are meant to live with our friends and derive some amount of meaning from our place [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2664.2200000000003s)]
*  in the social network and moving makes it difficult, especially if you're going to move [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2670.5s)]
*  to something that's completely unknown and you don't exactly know what you're moving [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2675.54s)]
*  to and why. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2681.7400000000002s)]
*  And then finally, and that's one thing that I think we think we should start putting a [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2684.3s)]
*  little more in our economic model, is the fact that it seems in surveys people keep [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2695.3s)]
*  declaring one thing to derive meaning from their job, but they don't always do and they [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2701.54s)]
*  are more likely to be deriving meaning from their job if they've held this job for a long [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2708.54s)]
*  time and if they've grown in expertise and in ranks in doing this particular job. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2712.54s)]
*  So here the geographic mobility is coupled with, or the lack of geographic mobility is [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2718.78s)]
*  coupled with a lack of sectoral mobility where people aren't just not particularly excited [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2723.82s)]
*  at all to leave their job making furniture to take another job 200 kilometers away being [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2730.46s)]
*  a security guard in a furniture company. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2737.8199999999997s)]
*  Why is any of that so different from the 1980s when mobility was quite high, even for people [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2741.06s)]
*  without children, mobility now is much lower than it was in the 80s. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2746.3399999999997s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2749.8999999999996s)]
*  Yes, it's about half now what it was in 1948 and the decline started in the 90s. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2750.8999999999996s)]
*  So it's very high in the 80s and then something happens. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2758.26s)]
*  And then something happens. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2760.78s)]
*  And the 90s are good years, right? You would think mobility would be rising in the 90s. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2761.78s)]
*  Now there's the internet, you find jobs through the internet. It's counterintuitive that mobility [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2765.78s)]
*  has fallen so much. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2769.94s)]
*  Not only that, but it's also the years where you start having a lot of geographically concentrated [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2770.94s)]
*  shocks because that's the 90s and 2000s when trade with China picks up. So it's where entire [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2775.7400000000002s)]
*  town would seem that they should go and pick up. So precisely at the moment where the factors [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2783.22s)]
*  you point out would have made geographic mobility easier and there was also more of a need for [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2788.74s)]
*  people to move. This is when we see people move less. So we don't have the full answer [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2795.74s)]
*  to these questions, but I think it's a little bit related to this meaningful jobs question. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2800.74s)]
*  This is also the time where the movement, the geographic movement would be not associated [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2808.62s)]
*  with finding a job in another furniture factory 200 kilometers away, but would be finding [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2814.14s)]
*  a job in a completely different sector where you would be starting from scratch and you're [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2819.8599999999997s)]
*  taking a job that you think is demeaning. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2825.2999999999997s)]
*  In your recent New York Times op-ed, you seem to argue that incentives are in general not [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2830.18s)]
*  that powerful in motivating people economically. And that surprised me because if I think of [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2835.1s)]
*  most J-PAL papers, incentives are pretty powerful. So your own paper on Indonesian roads, you [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2839.94s)]
*  put in much better roads, many more parents send their kids to school, right? It's a big [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2845.18s)]
*  response. The recent paper on drunk driving in India with Abhijit, police set up new road [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2849.22s)]
*  blocks, people respond to that incentive, they take other routes. So there are all these [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2854.9s)]
*  papers you've done, your lab has done showing incentives are powerful. Why in the op-ed [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2858.14s)]
*  say incentives don't matter so much? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2863.58s)]
*  What the op-ed says is that financial incentives are overrated. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2865.06s)]
*  Well, but getting educated or not being pulled over for a drunk driving traffic ticket, they're [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2869.42s)]
*  closely related to financial incentives. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2874.74s)]
*  The traffic ticket, I think, is much more than the financial incentive. If you get stopped [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2877.42s)]
*  by a traffic officer, you lose your car right this instant. So I think the inconvenience [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2881.66s)]
*  is much, much bigger. So the point is not that we are trying to make, is not that people [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2888.7s)]
*  are not sensitive to incentive because you can always construct incentive. If you construct [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2894.3799999999997s)]
*  broadly enough, then the incentive broadly enough, then it's almost always true. The [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2898.66s)]
*  point is also not that people are not responsive to financial incentive whatsoever. The point [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2903.2999999999997s)]
*  is that the parents' two financial incentives is less than what typically we assume is positive [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2908.7s)]
*  in terms of people seem to be pretty inelastic to taxes, both at all levels of income from [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2918.66s)]
*  the studies we have. People seem to be pretty inelastic to receiving money for sure. That [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2924.62s)]
*  doesn't lead them to go on vacation. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2931.62s)]
*  But that's just an income effect, right? It's not a price issue. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2934.18s)]
*  Yeah, so that's an income effect. But that's still, you would think the income effect also [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2936.18s)]
*  created this incentive to work. At least that's in our model. That's why we're a bit wary [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2940.2599999999998s)]
*  of welfare. But you take the negative income tax experiment, in fact, probably the first [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2944.18s)]
*  RCDs in the social science, as early as the 70s, they actually, what they were doing was [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2951.18s)]
*  kind of a Milton Friedman idea to kind of simplify welfare. But what they did in this [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2957.18s)]
*  experiment is to give people a certain level of income. But it was such that it was taxed [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2964.18s)]
*  away at a pretty steep rate. So about 50% of the people were facing about a 50% marginal [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2968.5s)]
*  tax on their income. And even there, the labor supply response were so low. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2975.66s)]
*  But take the French work many fewer hours a week than Americans. Isn't that mainly a [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2980.62s)]
*  tax effect, a price effect? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2984.82s)]
*  I don't think so, no. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2986.34s)]
*  No? What would it be? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2987.82s)]
*  Well, to start with, there is a regulation that's... [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2988.82s)]
*  But there are all these part-time jobs. In the 1970s, French and other Europeans worked [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2992.42s)]
*  more than Americans. Tax rates in Europe were lower. The 80s, expenditures and tax rates [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=2995.98s)]
*  go up. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3000.58s)]
*  It's always difficult to compare two countries. But my bet based on kind of extrapolating [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3001.58s)]
*  from the micro study is that that's not the financial effect. Because I think it comes [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3007.02s)]
*  much more from regulation, like how much can you work anyways, and from the availability [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3012.9s)]
*  of jobs, the availability of part-time jobs, there's actually much less, partly also due [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3019.54s)]
*  to regulations, and less to individual effort response, because they're thinking that they're [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3023.9s)]
*  going to be taxed away. That seems to me counterfactual. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3031.42s)]
*  In the new book, why not have more on social conservatism? So take something like single [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3035.1800000000003s)]
*  parenthood. It seems to be a big problem. There are many new studies showing it's maybe [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3039.02s)]
*  a bigger problem than we had thought. It's a cause of poverty, persistent poverty. It's [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3043.54s)]
*  kind of a right-wing issue for whatever reasons. Why not have more right-wing issues in your [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3048.2200000000003s)]
*  book? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3052.42s)]
*  I kind of do have these issues as outcomes. I don't know why it's a right-wing issue [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3053.42s)]
*  to worry about single parenthood, because as you were saying, all of the data suggests [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3057.42s)]
*  that it's not a very good thing to grow up as a kid of a single mom in their teens. And [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3062.2200000000003s)]
*  it's not a good thing for the single mom in question either. So it seems to me that it's [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3070.34s)]
*  not a right-wing, left-wing issue. In fact, the person I know who is the most left-wing [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3075.26s)]
*  probably is my mom. And that's one of our key battles, him trying to reduce teenage [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3080.06s)]
*  pregnancy issues in El Salvador. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3086.5s)]
*  And your father was a mathematician, right? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3089.42s)]
*  Yep. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3091.14s)]
*  And did you learn math from him? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3092.02s)]
*  I learned it at a very fundamental level. He's kind of a very fundamental mathematician. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3093.1s)]
*  So it left me, I think, with some good instinct. Going back to the issues, I don't think single [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3097.7s)]
*  motherhood is a left-wing or a right-wing issue. What would make it a social conservatism [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3105.2999999999997s)]
*  issue is to approach it from a moral feeling kind of a way. And what makes it a progressive [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3109.5s)]
*  issue is to approach it at the outcome of conditions in life that are potentially changeable. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3117.26s)]
*  Or maybe it's the same thing. And we do talk about it a bit in the book. In particular, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3125.42s)]
*  for example, one of the consequences of the fact that people are not mobile and that industries [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3131.22s)]
*  are clustered so that when there is a shock everybody kind of suffers together is that [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3135.78s)]
*  in those towns that are hit the most, you do see a kind of an erosion of these people [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3140.9s)]
*  are less like of these social norms. People are less likely to get married. They are more [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3145.9s)]
*  likely to have children out of wedlock, et cetera. So you do see this as one of the possible [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3151.38s)]
*  consequences of people's unhappiness. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3157.26s)]
*  What do you learn from rock climbing or how does it inspire you? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3162.32s)]
*  Many things you can learn from rock climbing. One is that it's a bit like empirical economics. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3165.94s)]
*  You kind of look at the wall and you have a decent idea of what might work. So you think [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3171.14s)]
*  of it as a theory or an intuition. But then when you try it out, sometimes it works, sometimes [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3179.42s)]
*  it doesn't. So that's kind of the data going in the way. It's also something you do socially. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3184.5s)]
*  You do need another person to catch you if you fall and you need to pay attention to [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3191.54s)]
*  the other person. A lot of economics is very social in this way. It's not competitive or [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3196.82s)]
*  at least not the way I do it. So it's kind of making slow and steady progress towards [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3203.34s)]
*  some goal. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3211.34s)]
*  Do you love South Indian classical music? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3212.1s)]
*  I like it. I love it would be a stronger statement than I should because I'm not a connoisseur. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3214.38s)]
*  I visit my husband and he's really into it. In fact, South India and North India both. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3221.5s)]
*  We listen to it at home and we go to concerts whenever we are in India. Chennai is one place [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3228.38s)]
*  where we do a lot of work and J-Pal has its headquarters and it has some of the best South [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3235.92s)]
*  Indian music. So I'm kind of an unenlightened amateur. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3239.86s)]
*  I've been to the December festival there. It was fantastic. I took my daughter. What [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3244.46s)]
*  in classical music interests you most? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3248.66s)]
*  In Western classical. To this I truly love. Indian classical I also love but with no expertise [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3251.58s)]
*  whatsoever. Western classical I grew up listening to forever. What interests me the most? I [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3259.2200000000003s)]
*  don't even know if interest in the world because it's kind of very visceral. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3266.66s)]
*  And what is it? What do you put on? What's your desert island disc? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3270.62s)]
*  Oh, that's back. So I listen to back almost every morning. When I'm in the morning I listen [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3273.7400000000002s)]
*  to when I'm working and in particular to back cantatas. So that's kind of my morning [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3280.94s)]
*  music. Then in the afternoon I kind of move on to more frontier stuff like Schumann or [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3285.38s)]
*  something like that. It's only after dinner that it moves to Bob Dylan. So definitely [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3290.58s)]
*  would be back and it would probably be one of the passions or if I could have two I would [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3297.58s)]
*  take two. The two passions, St. John and St. Matthew's Passion. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3305.06s)]
*  What advice do you give to your talented undergraduates that differs from the advice your colleagues [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3310.12s)]
*  would give them? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3315.22s)]
*  I give them almost all of them the advice to take some time off and to in particular [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3316.44s)]
*  if they have any interest in development which is generally the reason why they come to see [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3325.48s)]
*  me in the first place. But even if they don't really to spend a year or two in a developing [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3329.64s)]
*  country working on a project, not necessarily an RCT, any project like spending time in [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3336.64s)]
*  the field. This is what Michael Kremer did before he went back to graduate school and [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3341.12s)]
*  I think that was determinant to him. This to some extent is what I did with my little [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3346.48s)]
*  Russia experience and this was clearly very central to me. It's only through this exposure [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3350.2s)]
*  that you can learn how wrong most of your intuitions are and preconceptions are. I think [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3355.6s)]
*  we can tell it to them until they are blue in the face to not let themselves be guided [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3366.64s)]
*  by what seems obvious to them but until they've confronted what they think is obvious to something [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3371.04s)]
*  entirely different and it doesn't come, it's not clear. Whether or not this is different [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3378.46s)]
*  from what my colleagues would say, I don't know. Maybe some of my colleagues would say [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3384.62s)]
*  that it's better off, you're better off staying home and cranking some data and getting this [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3389.3599999999997s)]
*  type of skills. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3395.96s)]
*  Matthew Feeney Obviously it hasn't stopped you any but [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3396.96s)]
*  you worry that development economics in some ways puts women at a disadvantage because [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3399.04s)]
*  some emerging economies are especially dangerous for women. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3403.78s)]
*  Léa Léa Oh, I think- [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3406.8s)]
*  Matthew Feeney India in particular, that may be the case. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3407.8s)]
*  Léa Léa I think development economics is the most gender [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3410.6s)]
*  balanced subfield of all of economics. In fact, if anything, there are more women and [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3413.8s)]
*  powerful women in development than men. So whatever it is, it does not stop them and [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3419.6s)]
*  there are many, many women working on India. So of course you don't do silly things and [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3426.2400000000002s)]
*  the advantage of working and of having this infrastructure that I was talking about before [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3434.48s)]
*  is that it makes it possible for people to always be in groups and to kind of work in [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3439.52s)]
*  a context where they are safe and at the same time they can get the experience of living [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3444.6s)]
*  in these environments. And I think that makes people often very aware that gender rights [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3452.52s)]
*  for example is something to study very deeply. So for example, one of my graduate students, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3457.16s)]
*  Maddy McElway, worked in a rural UP in one of the parts of India which was some of the [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3461.92s)]
*  most extreme gender inequity and she conducted a project like a master with a group of largely [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3469.0s)]
*  female research assistants and got everybody to kind of go along with her. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3479.0s)]
*  Matthew Feeney Last question. If you could institute a reform [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3484.0s)]
*  to increase opportunity for women in economics, what would you do? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3487.32s)]
*  Léa Léa So I think there are two things that one could [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3490.48s)]
*  do. I don't know if there are reforms per se but one is to change a little bit the climate [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3492.92s)]
*  in the economics profession. It's not particularly anti-woman per se. Some people argue it is [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3502.04s)]
*  people are for example more likely to interrupt women than men, etc. But even if they weren't, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3507.7200000000003s)]
*  they are just in general likely to interrupt each other. We are not a very touchy-feely [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3512.8s)]
*  culture in economics. It doesn't bother me it turns out so that's not something that [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3517.76s)]
*  has stopped me in any way but it bothers many people and it tends to bother women and I [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3523.2400000000002s)]
*  think minority more. So changing the culture of course is not a reform per se but there [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3528.6000000000004s)]
*  are small things you can do that can help. One thing we've done at MIT, very simple, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3536.76s)]
*  is to institute the rule that someone who gives a seminar gets the first 15 minutes [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3542.12s)]
*  uninterrupted. And that is for our seminars, the development seminars, I think it's actually [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3549.12s)]
*  improved the experience for everyone, the speaker and the audience. So that's one. That's [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3555.44s)]
*  not huge but think of this as one, you know, I'm not the magic bullet type of person and [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3561.0s)]
*  I don't think there is one there. One of the silver pellets you could do there. The other [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3565.68s)]
*  is not about, it is something we could do outside of the economic profession which is [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3570.96s)]
*  to change a little bit the image that economics has to the outside world. I think for a lot [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3578.12s)]
*  of high school students, college students, they are a bit like me when I was considering [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3583.84s)]
*  economics is like, oh, number one it's like talk about interest rate and central banks [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3589.96s)]
*  and it's kind of boring. And number two it goes with incredibly crude tools and in fact [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3596.16s)]
*  both of these statements are wrong about the state of our discipline. In fact we study [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3603.64s)]
*  any number of issues including those but also extreme poverty, discrimination, inequality [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3608.52s)]
*  and we study them with lots of very sophisticated tools and relevant empirical tools, etc. And [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3616.04s)]
*  making, I think if people were more aware at an early age before they choose a field, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3623.16s)]
*  there would be more women to start with choosing to study economics and then hopefully more [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3628.56s)]
*  would continue which I think is something we really need, not just women but also minority [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3633.88s)]
*  because economics is a social science and as a social science we do need diversity and [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3639.04s)]
*  experiences and point of views, etc. Because people with different background including [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3647.04s)]
*  gender and life experiences will be interested in different questions and also will bring [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3654.8s)]
*  a slightly different perspective to those questions so it would be a bit more, it would [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3660.8s)]
*  make the field more vibrant. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6mmjixfsPM&t=3667.08s)]
