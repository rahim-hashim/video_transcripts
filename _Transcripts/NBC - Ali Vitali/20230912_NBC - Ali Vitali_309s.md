# Democrats prepare defense amid Biden impeachment threat
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw)
*  Democrats are preparing their defense as Republicans now threaten to impeach President Joe Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=0.0s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says they've gathered enough evidence to launch a formal [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=5.92s)]
*  inquiry which he is expected to endorse later this week. However, ranking member of the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=10.32s)]
*  House Oversight Committee, Congressman Jamie Raskin, is this GOP-led probe as a, quote, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=14.72s)]
*  total bust. That comment was in a 14-page memo that outlines the Democrats' case to defend the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=21.92s)]
*  president. Sources tell NBC News that Raskin has held several strategy sessions with other [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=28.0s)]
*  Democrats so far this year. Republicans claim Biden used his power as vice president to help [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=34.16s)]
*  further his son Hunter's foreign business dealings. They have yet to provide any real evidence of that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=41.04s)]
*  Joining us now, White House correspondent for Politico and co-author of the playbook, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  our friend Eugene Daniels. Eugene, good morning. So let's start with the Democrats' defense. What [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  more have we learned as to what they're going to say? Yeah, it's going to be a lot of what we've [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=54.72s)]
*  already heard on this air, actually. If you read through Jamie Raskin's 14-page memo, if you pay [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  attention to this stuff, this is stuff that we've heard over and over again that they feel like [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=65.12s)]
*  there's no evidence after investigation after investigation that House Republicans have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=70.64s)]
*  launched that it's a distraction from the, in their eyes, crimes of Donald Trump and an attempt [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=75.92s)]
*  to muddy the waters for voters ahead of the 2024 election, right? This is something that they have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=83.6s)]
*  been thinking and talking about for a very long time. Even before the midterms, you and I worked [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=89.44s)]
*  on stories about how Democrats were going to engage in this, how the White House was going [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  to engage in this, because we knew from the very beginning that the House would, an impeachment [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=99.44s)]
*  inquiry and likely an impeachment vote was going to happen on Joe Biden. The time will tell us that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=104.0s)]
*  ever actually comes to fruition, but Democrats are kind of for the first time, if you talk to a lot [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=109.84s)]
*  of them, trying to get ahead of the ball and play offense instead of defense here. So Congressman [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, who's been a critic of McCarthy, is expected to deliver a speech today in the House as [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=119.84s)]
*  they come back in a session, really going after McCarthy again. It seems linked to me that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=124.72s)]
*  McCarthy is now looking like he wants to push forth on this impeachment inquiry, in part to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=131.04s)]
*  placate those in the far right who are mad at him for all these spending deals. So what's McCarthy's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=135.04s)]
*  plan here, Eugene? How is he going to be able to get the votes he needs to put this forward? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=139.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's walking a tight, tight line here, right? Because as folks remember, when he was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=145.6s)]
*  eventually voted in as Speaker of the House, there's this motion to vacate. So it only takes [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=151.12s)]
*  one person to kind of get him out, try to get the ball moving to get him out of the job as House [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=156.64s)]
*  Speaker. So over and over and over again, he's had to placate folks like Matt Gaetz for the things [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  that they want, this impeachment inquiry being one of them. At this point, it's unclear how he [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=168.0s)]
*  gets the votes. You've seen over and over, moderate Republicans, folks who are on the front lines [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=172.32s)]
*  in some of these purple districts, purple states, concerned outright against doing an impeachment [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=178.32s)]
*  inquiry. And what McCarthy has also said is that he will only do this if he gets a full vote of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=185.68s)]
*  House, right? This is something that Nancy Pelosi didn't have to do in the past. And so whether or [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=190.64s)]
*  not he can actually get 218 votes remains to be seen. It doesn't look great at this point, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=195.92s)]
*  but he is trying to balance all of those things. I think what he really wants to do is to give [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  conservatives, make conservatives feel like he's hearing them and doing what they want in that, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  oh no, I was just stopped by the moderates. And Eugene, briefly give us a sense as to how [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=212.16s)]
*  the White House is going to approach the impending government shutdown. It seems like they're sort of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  really just putting the ball in the building behind you and saying, hey, this is on them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=220.88s)]
*  We're not involved. But if the government shuts down, it inevitably could be economic impact and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=224.72s)]
*  some blame could be cast on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, too. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=231.52s)]
*  Yeah. It's never good for anyone, right? There's always this question about who's the winner or [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=234.96s)]
*  the loser in government shutdowns, and it's no one, right? No one is the winner in the country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=239.68s)]
*  And both sides of the aisle are losers. I mean, you are right. At this point, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=244.96s)]
*  the administration, and they've done this over and over again on some of these bigger, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  more controversial issues, saying that it is on Republicans and Democrats in Congress to figure [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=252.88s)]
*  out how to get this done. You heard Kareem Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=258.64s)]
*  over and over again in the past say that they have to do their duty, their constitutional duty [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  on some of these issues. I don't think that's going to change. And I think that's one of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=266.8s)]
*  ways that they see it as making sure they're hands off in the blame game at the end of the day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=270.56s)]
*  And so far, that approach has largely worked. We will stay on it. White House correspondent [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=275.12s)]
*  for Politico and co-author of the playbook, Eugene Daniels. Thank you for being with us [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=279.6s)]
*  this morning. And thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on this Tuesday morning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QznhhXV_OZw&t=283.28000000000003s)]
