# U.S. health agencies hit with mass layoffs by Trump administration
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo)
*  Welcome back. We're learning more about what agencies have been affected by the Trump administration's continued mass layoffs across the Health and Human Services Department. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=0.0s)]
*  That is, of course, just one. But several sources tell Politico the cuts have hit staffers at the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=10.0s)]
*  The firings were part of cuts affecting about 3,600 probationary employees across the department. Joining us now, White House correspondent for Politico, Adam Cankron. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=23.0s)]
*  Adam, first, Trump officials are saying that these are methodological firings and that they are meant to serve the larger goal of cutting 10 percent of the workforce. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=33.0s)]
*  But there's actual, tangible impacts to this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=42.0s)]
*  There absolutely is. Anytime you do a culling of this many people, and we're talking about the administration has said about 3,600 people across the health department, that's going to hit several offices and it's going to hit several offices abruptly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=44.0s)]
*  And from what we've heard, the evidence that we've seen so far, these haven't been kind of precision surgical cuts. These are people who are finding out out of the blue that they are being fired. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=56.0s)]
*  These are people who have been fired without their supervisor's knowledge or even Trump political appointees in the agencies knowing who of their reports is going to be out and what the impact is going to be afterward. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=67.0s)]
*  So it's the same kind of a method that we've seen this slash and burn, maybe ask questions afterwards. Is there any sense that when you look, for example, at disease preparedness and response teams, again, amid an avian bird flu outbreak, as the White House has said, senior officials have said to me, well, you know, this is something that we're prepared to deal with. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=78.0s)]
*  And yet they're slashing people from the very place that is dealing with it. How does that work? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=96.0s)]
*  Well, absolutely. I mean, we've seen cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, right? That the main public health agency for this country, HHS, has an emergency preparedness and response unit, which is a lot of times on the front line of things like the bird flu response and monitoring Ebola overseas, that kind of thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=102.0s)]
*  There were cuts in that office as well over the weekend. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=119.0s)]
*  And so there's just this core tension of how much can you pare down while still making sure that you're doing the surveillance, doing the research, doing the kind of activities that are going to make sure that this country remains safe from all these various health threats. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=122.0s)]
*  And that's really the question here is whether this White House feels like it can really, really shrink the workforce and at the same time keep an eye on these kinds of constant things that are at threat of coming into the country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=136.0s)]
*  Because it's not just the layoffs that we're seeing, you know, at the agencies themselves. When you also talk about the funding freeze, you're seeing people who receive grants from these agencies doing important research on all matter of diseases, also seeing their funding pulled. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=148.0s)]
*  I think on the layoffs piece, though, there might be people who are wondering, is there an end in sight for this? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=163.0s)]
*  It does feel and you and I were saying this during the break, like every Friday we get to a point where you go into a weekend of just hearing about layoff news. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=168.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this has been the main source of anxiety talking to people in the Health and Human Services building as an example of people just don't know when this is going to be over. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=175.0s)]
*  And it's ironic we're talking about government efficiency because I'm talking to folks who say I haven't actually been able to do my job in the last few days because we're just trying to figure out if we will have jobs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=185.0s)]
*  One example, there was an office in the Medicare and Medicaid agency that around 4 p.m. Friday there had been no notices of terminations. Supervisors were telling their employees, I think we're safe because I think we do something this administration values. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=195.0s)]
*  Terminations started rolling in Friday afternoon into Saturday morning and afternoon. And now suddenly people are saying, I guess I'm out of a job. I guess I wasn't valued that much. So really a lot of anxiety and nervousness. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=209.0s)]
*  A lot of anxiety. We've been having this conversation the entire time. And again, I think the important reminder here is these are not faceless government entities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=221.0s)]
*  It is people who want to go to work. They want to do their jobs. They want to help their fellow Americans in whatever service capacity they are in. Adam Kincren, thank you so much for following this story. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=229.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Skj625Hwo&t=259.0s)]
