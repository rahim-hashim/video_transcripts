# At least 120 dead, more than 170 missing after Texas flood
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g)
*  Because as the sun rises over central Texas today, residents are still grieving the loss of at least [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=0.0s)]
*  120 people across six counties after storms surged through the region nearly one week ago. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=4.8s)]
*  A desperate search by air, water, land, and even horseback continues at this hour. As officials say, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  more than 170 people are still missing. That number includes five campers and one counselor [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=16.16s)]
*  from the beloved Camp Mystic, where more heartbreaking stories of loss are revealed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=21.52s)]
*  with each passing day. They include eight-year-old camper Mary Kate Jacobi. Her family says she [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=25.2s)]
*  entered the gates of heaven, adding she was tiny but mighty and full of love. Today, questions [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=30.4s)]
*  continue about whether more could have been done to warn residents ahead of those catastrophic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=35.84s)]
*  floods. At a press conference yesterday, local officials defended their response and said those [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=40.4s)]
*  questions about how they handled it will be answered in time. I believe those questions need [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  to be answered to the family of the missed loved ones, to the public. We're not running, we're not [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=50.8s)]
*  going to hide from anything. That's going to be checked into at a later time. I wish I could tell [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=54.88s)]
*  you that time. Folks, I don't know how many lives our KPD team saved in an hour in Kerrville, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  but I know that this tragedy, as horrific as it is, could have been so much worse. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=66.72s)]
*  This comes as new reporting from NBC News revealed that the former Kerr County Commissioner [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=75.12s)]
*  described the county's flood warning system as antiquated all the way back in 2016, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=79.44s)]
*  and that Kerr County officials then discussed warning systems more than two dozen times since [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=84.16s)]
*  then. NBC News correspondent Priscilla Thompson has the latest for us from the ground in Kerrville. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=88.56s)]
*  Priscilla? Yeah, right now the search for the missing is continuing to grow more urgent and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=93.36s)]
*  more desperate with each passing day. We know that officials have said that they have some very [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=99.36s)]
*  heavy machinery out here as they are trying to work their way through this very large debris. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=104.16s)]
*  You have large trees that are down, you have vehicles that were pulled in to the river, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=108.8s)]
*  also pieces of homes, according to officials. And so they are urging the volunteers who are out here [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=113.68s)]
*  who want to help the people who are searching to continue to do so, but not in the areas where they [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=118.72000000000001s)]
*  see that heavy machinery, because they are trying to handle these areas obviously very delicately [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=123.84s)]
*  in case they're recovering remains or perhaps there is the miracle that they will find someone [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=129.12s)]
*  still who is alive. But I will tell you, officials have said that they have not pulled anyone out [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=134.4s)]
*  alive since Friday. Meanwhile, you also have the governor overnight releasing his priorities for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=140.16s)]
*  the special session, which is set to begin later this month. And that, of course, at the top of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=146.8s)]
*  that list are all of these issues around flooding. That includes flood warning systems, flood emergency [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=152.4s)]
*  communication, relief funding for this Hill Country area and these floods, and also natural [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=158.8s)]
*  disaster preparation and recovery. And officials are continuing to be pressed about this response. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=164.32s)]
*  And whether or not they acted appropriately in the hours as these floodwaters were coming in, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=170.08s)]
*  but officials still not answering specifically many of these questions, only saying that right [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  now their focus remains on so many of those people who are still missing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=179.84s)]
*  NBC's Priscilla Thompson, thank you for your updates. And elsewhere in the Southwest, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=186.4s)]
*  at least three people have died after flash floods swept through the mountain region, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  Mountain Village of Rio do so New Mexico. Video shows broken trees destroyed homes and muddy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  debris as rescue crews worked to clean the wreckage. Officials say a four year old girl, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  a seven year old boy and a man aged 40 to 50 were the victims of yesterday's flood. Four people in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=205.52s)]
*  the community there remain missing. Rio do so though, is no stranger to natural disasters. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  Wildfires raged through the area last year, leaving burns scar in the hillsides and canyons [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=216.56s)]
*  that was then unable to absorb much of Tuesday's rainfall. A lot of weather happening around the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=221.12s)]
*  country that we're tracking. White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas, is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=226.8s)]
*  joining us now and it's at the nexus of politics and those natural disasters that we should start [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=230.32s)]
*  this morning because the president is set to go tomorrow, I believe, with the first lady to tour [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=235.6s)]
*  that damage in Texas. What do you imagine that is going to look like? We've seen some controversial [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=240.96s)]
*  trips from him before to people who are struggling in the aftermath of natural disasters. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=247.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think this trip will be something that we've seen before. We're expecting him to go to Texas, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=251.68s)]
*  meet with family members, get a briefing from local officials there. I'm sure he will meet with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=258.64s)]
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott. He has very good relationships with people in Texas. These are [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=266.08s)]
*  political allies of his. I think what's different about this trip is that he has talked about phasing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=271.68s)]
*  out FEMA and this idea that the federal government should not have a large role in handling these [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=278.0s)]
*  kinds of disasters in the future. I think this case, and we could see in other cases in the future, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=285.76s)]
*  is just how well can states really respond to these kinds of incidents? There's been concerns [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=294.24s)]
*  lack of a warning system as this terrible storm came through. Is that something that a state can [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=301.76s)]
*  really do on its own, or is this just one of those functions that you need the federal government [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=308.64s)]
*  to provide that kind of leadership? So much of what FEMA does in the aftermath of a storm is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=314.4s)]
*  to flood the zone with money, but also coordination. It's a huge effort to coordinate all of these [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=320.4s)]
*  responses. It's overwhelming for governors, for local officials on the ground when these storms [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=329.36s)]
*  happen. Is this something really that a state can do on its own? Keep in mind, this is the start of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=336.72s)]
*  hurricane season. We don't know what is ahead. Are we going to have other states in the southeast [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=344.24s)]
*  that may have to deal with a massive hurricane and a recovery? I think this really just raises [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=351.92s)]
*  questions of whether we can really phase out FEMA like this administration has been talking about, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=357.44s)]
*  or are we going to have to basically do what we've done in the past, which is maintain a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=363.36s)]
*  federal presence? Yeah, I think that that's one of the central questions here, because you're right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=366.96s)]
*  Trump is going to a place where he has political allies that shouldn't really be a part of this [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=370.88s)]
*  conversation, and yet I think you're right to point it out. So the open question, as he talks [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=374.72s)]
*  about phasing out FEMA and the timing again, so important, the start of hurricane season, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=378.8s)]
*  all of that is really going to come into play. And it'll test whether this is an administration [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=383.36s)]
*  that can take in new information that might not jive with what it initially was trying to do [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=386.8s)]
*  policy-wise. Will they change course? I mean, we'll ultimately end up seeing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1-B_hxOj8g&t=391.52000000000004s)]
