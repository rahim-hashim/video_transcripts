# Elon Musk's takeover is causing rifts in Trump's inner circle
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A)
*  A coalition of 13 state attorneys general plans to sue the Trump administration over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon Musk's access to the Treasury Department. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=6.24s)]
*  New York State Attorney General Letitia James announced the suit yesterday calling Musk [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  and his Doge teams access to bank accounts and social security data unlawful. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=13.4s)]
*  A federal judge yesterday signed an order limiting two of Musk's allies to read only [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=18.36s)]
*  access to Treasury Department payment systems. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=23.12s)]
*  The order also blocks all other Doge staffers from that information. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=25.96s)]
*  But one of the Doge members with that read only access reportedly resigned yesterday [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=29.84s)]
*  after the Wall Street Journal found a social media account connected to that staff member [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=34.68s)]
*  advocating for racism and eugenics. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=38.88s)]
*  And then there's this a new report reveals that in less than three weeks since Trump [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=42.16s)]
*  administration the Trump administration took office, Elon Musk is causing rifts and fissures [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=45.6s)]
*  within the president's inner circle. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  One self described ride or die MAGA Republican operative who knows President Trump personally [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=52.72s)]
*  confided to wired something they claim they never thought they'd find themselves saying [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=58.0s)]
*  just weeks into Trump's second term. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=62.0s)]
*  This is a quote they say there could be a collision course coming here at some point [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=64.36s)]
*  when asked about if there's a brewing freak out over Musk and Trump world quote he's getting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=68.64s)]
*  too big for his britches. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now the author of that report politics reporter covering President Trump and wired [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  contributor Jake LaHutte. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=80.12s)]
*  Jake this is a really fascinating look inside the Trump White House. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=81.64s)]
*  You spoke to half a dozen Trump loyalist Republican aides and advisors inside and around [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=85.88s)]
*  the administration. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=90.52s)]
*  I think many of them even though they say they're shocked to be saying this the rift [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=91.88s)]
*  almost seemed inevitable. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  But how much of a rift actually is it and what is the sense behind the scenes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=97.64s)]
*  So I still don't have a clear sense of the factions at play here but it's happening and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=103.16s)]
*  I wouldn't call it a full blown freak out quite yet but the folks I talked to have all [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=108.72s)]
*  been loyal to Trump and have been on the train since before January 6th and it takes quite [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=115.96s)]
*  a lot to rattle or surprise these people and these are folks who you know normally would [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=121.92s)]
*  be inclined to spin this in some sort of way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=129.0s)]
*  Instead they don't know who to turn to. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=133.64s)]
*  A lot of them want Susie Wiles the White House Chief of Staff to intervene in some form. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=136.6s)]
*  I don't have any idea what that would look like. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=142.12s)]
*  Another new tidbit here was the White House told us that the Doge briefings are happening [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  sorry as needed supposedly on a daily basis and that Doge is in the White House now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=150.88s)]
*  Now the question is just because they say that like are they or are they still technically [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=156.24s)]
*  under a different agency as though the executive order was supposed to establish it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=161.64s)]
*  Right because there's all these structural questions here about OK Musk has the office [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=166.96s)]
*  in the EEOB but there's questions about if they are abiding by government records requirements [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=171.72s)]
*  that's a key piece of this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=177.6s)]
*  So there's the structural concerns and then there's the more personal rift pieces of this [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  between Musk and other members of the inner circle. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=183.84s)]
*  So let's start on that point because what's the biggest issue that people have with Musk [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=186.6s)]
*  right now. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=190.52s)]
*  It depends on who you ask Ali I think that for a number of them this is just coming down [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=192.52s)]
*  to optics and you know you got to remember with Donald Trump he's a man who watches a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=198.68s)]
*  lot of television watches a lot of weekend Fox News which his cabinet would support. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  He generally likes to have you know the look the aesthetics locked down. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=209.24s)]
*  So for some of them this just simply falls into the category of a bad look. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=214.56s)]
*  I think for others they are like OK who the heck are all of these early 20 somethings [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=217.84s)]
*  or in the one case of the big balls kid a literal teenager and a shout out to my colleague [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=224.4s)]
*  Tori Elliott for breaking that story along with several others. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=229.28s)]
*  So they all have different motivations at play here but the common theme I've been hearing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  from them and this goes back a little further actually is that they're all trying to find [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=237.72000000000003s)]
*  ways to more or less insulate themselves from the blast here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah that that's certainly a way to survive in Trump world. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=246.64s)]
*  I think my question is two pronged which is how much of this is Musk grading on other [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=249.88s)]
*  staffers or how much of this is Musk and Trump starting to butt heads. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=255.44s)]
*  And then really if they do start butting heads what's the recourse. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=259.96s)]
*  Can you do kick Musk out of Doge and say actually never mind the whole thing we're scrapping [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=263.94s)]
*  it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=267.76s)]
*  So at least as of yet I don't have a clear indication on whether Trump has soured on [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=269.08s)]
*  Musk in any fashion. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=273.88s)]
*  I did speak to a longtime adviser who speaks with Trump frequently and he said all he's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=274.96s)]
*  heard from the president so far is that it's going great loves it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the bigger problem here is one I actually think Musk is in a much weaker position than [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  people think. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  He is heavily heavily dependent on federal contracts as has been established. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=293.96s)]
*  He's heavily dependent on the goodwill of Beijing and he is really not that liquid and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=297.96s)]
*  He's learning all this on the fly yet for some reason when I talk to my Trump sources [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=303.8s)]
*  they think he's you know some sort of godlike figure who no one can do anything about when [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=308.68s)]
*  the reality is like he needs this situation and set up more than almost anybody else Trump [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=315.16s)]
*  has brought in. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=320.28s)]
*  The question of what he's doing with the data if that could have long term implications [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=321.28s)]
*  for future business. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=326.32s)]
*  That's all still to be questioned. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=328.14s)]
*  But I do have a story on Cash Patel and Elon Musk coming out later today that may shed [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=330.08s)]
*  some light on those pre-existing tensions. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=335.44s)]
*  And TV we call that a really good tease. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=338.96s)]
*  Wired contributor Jake LaHutte will look out for that and thank you for your reporting [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=340.96s)]
*  this morning. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=344.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ate3QCmj8A&t=360.08s)]
