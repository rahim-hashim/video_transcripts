# Is tonight a make-or-break debate for Chris Christie?
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o)
*  So let's shift gears and talk about the Republican primary debate tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=0.0s)]
*  Julie Manchester just offered us a preview from the site there in Alabama. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  What are some things you're going to be looking for this evening? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=7.24s)]
*  I'm looking to see what Chris Christie does. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=8.76s)]
*  He's under a lot of pressure right now to drop out because Nikki Haley is really starting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=10.76s)]
*  to take the lead. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=16.06s)]
*  And as you know, I've said from a couple of months now, DeSantis is going nowhere fast. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=17.44s)]
*  So does Christie start fighting for his political life in New Hampshire or does he try and take [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=21.96s)]
*  on Haley or DeSantis trying to make some news there? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=27.04s)]
*  I'll also see if Nikki Haley really wants to go after anyone besides Ramaswami because [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=30.0s)]
*  that's how she's done so well in the debates by showing, like you said earlier, she's the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=37.0s)]
*  grown up in the room. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=41.44s)]
*  She's showed her strength against Ramaswami's weakness. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=43.08s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see where she chooses to engage. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=46.64s)]
*  Yeah, certainly no love lost between those two candidates. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=49.36s)]
*  That's been clear every time we've seen this group. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=51.72s)]
*  DeSantis, as you mentioned, you've been on this earlier that you don't think he's going [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=55.12s)]
*  anywhere with more signs of tumult, fundraising woes, et cetera. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=58.64s)]
*  He'll make it to Iowa, we certainly believe, but what are the stakes? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  What does he need to do there? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=64.88s)]
*  He's got to somehow change things around, but it's hard for him because the premise [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=67.56s)]
*  of his whole campaign was I'm Trump without the baggage. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=72.04s)]
*  That worked in January where Trump's numbers were falling, but Trump's numbers have only [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=76.64s)]
*  grown. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=82.08s)]
*  So why do you need Ron DeSantis if you have Donald Trump? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=83.32s)]
*  His argument is not there and right now with Trump's strength with Republican voters, he [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  has nowhere to go. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly it seems that Haley has now emerged as the most viable Trump alternative, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=93.52s)]
*  but we should underscore she's still down 30 on points in the polls. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=98.36s)]
*  We'll see if tonight's debate makes any difference. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  We, of course, will have complete coverage here on MSNBC. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeS8H2xiN-o&t=103.96s)]
