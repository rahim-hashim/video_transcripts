# Trump endorsed by half of Republican Congress members
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We turn back to politics. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=1.72s)]
*  Donald Trump has now secured an endorsement from half of all congressional Republicans. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=3.24s)]
*  With new support from Maryland Congressman Andy Harris, Trump now has the backing of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=8.84s)]
*  at least 114 Republican members of the House, along with 25 GOP senators. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=12.94s)]
*  Trump's one-time Texas Senator Ted Cruz is the latest member of the upper chamber to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=20.32s)]
*  endorse the former president. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=24.94s)]
*  Cruz, who announced his endorsement after Trump's win earlier this week in Iowa, said [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=27.52s)]
*  the GOP primary is, quote, over. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, special correspondent at Vanity Fair and host of the Fast Politics podcast, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=36.68s)]
*  Molly John Fast. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=42.96s)]
*  Molly, morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about these Republicans backing Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  It seems to be more evidence that his grip on the party is firm and also more evidence [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=51.0s)]
*  that even some of his previous opponents are seeing reality. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  They look at the inevitable results. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  Trump's going to be the nominee again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=63.8s)]
*  I mean, I think all of us who cover this have thought this for a while. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=64.8s)]
*  And I think it's an easy case of like, it's not that the primary is over. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=68.7s)]
*  It's that there never was a primary, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=74.28s)]
*  I mean, you had most people running as these sort of faint mimeographs of Donald Trump, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=76.32s)]
*  You had DeSantis as Trump without the charisma. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=82.36s)]
*  He never took off. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=85.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=86.88s)]
*  And then you had Nikki Haley was sort of a Hail Mary pass at the last minute where the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=87.88s)]
*  donor classes were like, oh, my God, I can't believe we're going to nominate Trump again. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=91.96s)]
*  Can we possibly get Nikki Haley? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=95.96s)]
*  But even Nikki Haley, all of these people are so tainted by Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=97.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=101.32s)]
*  Nikki Haley worked in the Trump administration. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=102.32s)]
*  There's talk that she's now auditioning for VP. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=104.16s)]
*  Again, you know, there's a lot of pushback, I think, on the Trump side. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=106.84s)]
*  But you know, that's a possibility. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=110.36s)]
*  No one ever offered, besides Chris Christie, who was never polling at more than about 2%, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=112.06s)]
*  you know, 2, 4, 5%. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=116.42s)]
*  No one ever offered something that wasn't, or Asa Hutchinson said, that wasn't just [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  Trumpism-like. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  So let's talk Haley. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, she is down about 10 or so points in New Hampshire. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  There is, I suppose, a bank shot path where if she were to somehow pull off this upset [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=130.18s)]
*  and win in New Hampshire, there's a month between New Hampshire and South Carolina. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=134.94s)]
*  Trump's way ahead in the polls in South Carolina. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=139.78s)]
*  But maybe if Trump was dealt with a defeat, he'd be rattled. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=141.78s)]
*  Who knows how he would implode over that month. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=144.26s)]
*  But for order for that path to happen, Haley has to win. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=147.04s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like she's taking the steps to win. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=149.46s)]
*  The campaign schedule has been light. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=151.54s)]
*  She's not really going on the attack. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=153.02s)]
*  What's your take on what she's doing? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=154.62s)]
*  Well, you and I are doing like the donor math, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=155.9s)]
*  Like every Republican donor sitting around going like, how can we get, push her over [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=159.18s)]
*  the top? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=162.94s)]
*  And I just don't, she, you know, look, going against Trump is really scary, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=164.02s)]
*  We see E. Jean Carroll doing that now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=169.26s)]
*  She testified she gets a ton of abuse online. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=171.54s)]
*  This is a scary thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  And even Nikki Haley, who where, you know, she's a Republican, too. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=176.45999999999998s)]
*  You have to imagine that this is an incredibly stressful thing, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  Like all these Republican senators refuse to stand up against him. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=183.7s)]
*  Here's this woman candidate who worked for him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  I think it's a very tough thing for her. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  And then also the problem is, even if she were to win every primary, which so far she [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=192.54s)]
*  has not won any, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  She came in second in Iowa. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=198.94s)]
*  She came in third in Iowa. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=200.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=201.82s)]
*  She would need to, he would need to go away. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=202.82s)]
*  And I'm not convinced that he stops running, even if he lost every primary. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=206.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=209.3s)]
*  Your latest piece in Vanity Fair, you make that point that it's a fantasy to think that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=210.3s)]
*  Donald Trump will just, will just go away. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=214.06s)]
*  We also don't have any reason to think he would accept any sort of loss. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=216.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=221.1s)]
*  So, so, you know, there's a chance here we're going to wake up Wednesday morning, Trump [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=222.1s)]
*  wins New Hampshire. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=225.74s)]
*  The race is over. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=226.74s)]
*  So how do you then forecast what the next few weeks and months would look like? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=227.74s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=230.62s)]
*  And remember, Trump is doing this really unprecedented thing where he's showing up at all his, all [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=231.62s)]
*  his criminal trials, all his civil trials. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=236.66s)]
*  You know, he was spent this week in court. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=240.58s)]
*  You know, we have never had a presidential candidate spend his time in court. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=243.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=247.94s)]
*  And, and I'm not sure how great that juxtaposition is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=248.94s)]
*  You know, you have Biden doing infrastructure. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=251.74s)]
*  might be boring, but it's very presidential versus Donald Trump, you know, truth socialing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=254.58s)]
*  about E.G. and Carol. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=261.14s)]
*  I'm not sure that's the contrast you want. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=262.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=264.74s)]
*  And lastly, and briefly, just want to get your take also on what we were talking about [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=265.74s)]
*  with Joyce a minute ago. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=268.7s)]
*  Trump's incendiary claim that a president should have total immunity even for things [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=270.14s)]
*  that cross the line, which opens the door to not only potentially him confessing what [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=274.16s)]
*  he's done before, but the possibility he could order up a political assassination in the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=278.3s)]
*  future. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, that's an issue that could resonate with some voters. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=282.9s)]
*  I mean, those judge, it resonated with the judges, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=284.9s)]
*  The judges were like, you could have sealed team six, you know, I mean, again, it's a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  very scary idea of having a president who is completely lawless, who is not held in, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=292.7s)]
*  you know, in the bounds that the rest of us are. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=297.9s)]
*  I don't know that that's a winning argument for getting back in office. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=300.06s)]
*  And again, I think this is the problem with Trump's grip on the party is that there really [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=304.26s)]
*  to say, like, perhaps this is not the greatest plan to win reelection. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=308.18s)]
*  It might scare off just enough independent voters. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=312.86s)]
*  Now it's up to the Democrats to turn out their own base. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=315.22s)]
*  Great analysis, as always, from special correspondent at Vanity Fair and host of the Fast Politics [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=317.18s)]
*  podcast, Molly Jong. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=322.5s)]
*  Fast, Molly, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV1MrEV5ctQ&t=324.26s)]
