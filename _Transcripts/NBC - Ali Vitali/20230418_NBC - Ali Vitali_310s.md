# Dominion, Fox defamation trial expected to begin Tuesday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The jury trial in Dominion's defamation lawsuit against Fox News is expected to get underway [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=1.0s)]
*  later today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=5.36s)]
*  It was originally supposed to start yesterday, but the judge delayed it without giving a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=6.36s)]
*  specific reason. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=10.14s)]
*  Now, two sources tell The Washington Post that it was pushed back so both sides could [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=11.28s)]
*  talk about a potential settlement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=15.6s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch, reports [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=17.28s)]
*  the network did make a late push to settle. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=21.88s)]
*  But unless there's a last minute deal, this one would be pretty unexpected. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=24.22s)]
*  The jury selection will resume this morning at 9 Eastern, followed by opening statements. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=27.92s)]
*  The trial is expected to last about six weeks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=32.32s)]
*  And for more on this, let's bring in media reporter for Semaphore, Max Taney. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=35.24s)]
*  Max, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=38.96s)]
*  So first of all, do we have a sense as to how close, if at all, they came to a settlement [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=39.96s)]
*  yesterday? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=45.52s)]
*  You know, the sense that I get from talking to people close to the case is that both sides [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=46.52s)]
*  are, you know, while there are some incentives for both sides to settle, that they are really [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  prepared to go to trial. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=56.76s)]
*  And you know, the fact that there hasn't been any settlement or any news from the last 12 [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=58.6s)]
*  hours suggests that when court opens this morning, there is actually going to be a trial. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=64.44s)]
*  There will be opening statements. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=70.08s)]
*  And you know, that some of the top Fox News personalities will testify. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=71.76s)]
*  There's always the possibility for kind of something to kind of come up at the last minute. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  And you know, the two sides could settle really at any point. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Fox has been, you know, Fox's incentives once the trial do start, you know, to settle kind [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=85.0s)]
*  of lessen because, you know, this is one of their major, one of the major things that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  they would want to avoid is these kind of embarrassing testimonies from people like, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=95.72s)]
*  you know, Rupert Murdoch or, you know, Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson or, you know, any [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  of the other higher ups or prominent figures at Fox News. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=103.88s)]
*  So looks like it's going to trial and it's going to begin in just a few hours. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=106.96s)]
*  So so much damaging stuff has already come out too, through discovery, emails, texts [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  and such. So to walk us through what this trial could be like, you just mentioned some [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=114.56s)]
*  of Fox News's most prominent personalities. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=117.56s)]
*  Is there an expectation that they and others, perhaps newsroom figures not as well known [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=119.8s)]
*  to the public, but still really important to the network, that they'll all be called [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=123.84s)]
*  on the stand? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=126.76s)]
*  Absolutely. The trial could last for as long as six weeks and there could be a major figure [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=127.76s)]
*  testifying as early as today. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=131.72s)]
*  What we know is that Dominion wants to start this with a bang. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=134.36s)]
*  And you know, they could call witnesses such as, you know, Rupert Murdoch, Tucker Carlson, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=137.84s)]
*  Sean Hannity, you know, sometime even within the next few days, they want to make a really [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  strong case in their opening statement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  And there might be some time kind of later at the end of the day to get one of these [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=151.44s)]
*  big witnesses. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  We don't really know for sure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  And we don't know how long the jury selection process is going to take. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, but we could start seeing some of the names that, you know, some of your viewers [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=161.12s)]
*  may be familiar with sometime this week, which would be incredible and remarkable. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=165.0s)]
*  And Murdoch is a possibility himself. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=169.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=172.04s)]
*  We've heard that top Fox News executives are likely to, you know, to take the stand. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=173.04s)]
*  So let's take a step back for a second. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  And as this is going on, we obviously have another campaign season ramping up. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=180.2s)]
*  Is there any sense at all? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  Just give us your analysis of how Fox News is covering the trial, which seems like not [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  much at all. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=189.32s)]
*  And then B, is there any expectation this will impact how they approach this coming [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=190.32s)]
*  campaign and will they be less reluctant to tout things that they know are not true about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=195.04s)]
*  election results? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=199.28s)]
*  That's a really good question, Lemire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=200.32s)]
*  Well, you know, to the first point, what we do know that Fox is going to have somebody [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=201.88s)]
*  on the ground covering it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=205.68s)]
*  Howard Kurtz, their media columnist, longtime media host, said that he will actually be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=206.68s)]
*  covering the trial from Wilmington, which is a bit of a change because they've kind [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=213.12s)]
*  of tried to avoid this a little bit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=217.6s)]
*  You know, Howard Kurtz initially said that they didn't want to talk about something because [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=220.04s)]
*  it was ongoing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=223.88s)]
*  You know, Fox didn't want him kind of covering it because it was ongoing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=224.88s)]
*  But now it seems like that's shifted. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=226.84s)]
*  I mean, it's completely unavoidable. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=228.2s)]
*  It's going to be all over this network. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=229.92s)]
*  It's going to be all over CNN. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=231.16s)]
*  But to the latter point, I think it really depends on whether Fox comes out of this victorious. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=232.76s)]
*  And you know, there's always the possibility that that could be the case. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=238.6s)]
*  The standard that they're trying to meet is called actual malice, which is a really, really [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  hard legal standard to reach. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=246.04s)]
*  So you know, this could remain unchanged. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And you know, Maria Bartiromo, one of the hosts, is still a host on Fox News. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  And she has said essentially that she still believes some...she doesn't know what to believe [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=257.0s)]
*  about the 2020 election and whether or not there was fraud. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=261.52s)]
*  So you know, even though there's this big, huge trial going on, there's still some doubt [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=264.44s)]
*  even among people who are on Fox News. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=270.08s)]
*  So I mean, it's hard to say whether or not they've learned their lesson, so to speak, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=272.32s)]
*  you know, about putting these kind of false claims on the air. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=278.2s)]
*  And remind the viewers, how much money is at stake here? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=280.56s)]
*  $1.6 billion. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  $1.6 billion. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  Media reporter for 7 For Max Townie, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=285.0s)]
*  We'll talk to you again as the trial proceeds. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTBVce3pZAQ&t=287.8s)]
