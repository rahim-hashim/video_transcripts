# House GOP delays vote on next speaker after Republicans nominate Scalise
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ)
*  Our Republicans appear one step closer to electing a new House speaker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=0.0s)]
*  But we still don't have any idea when a vote will take place on the House floor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=5.04s)]
*  During a closed-door party meeting yesterday, Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise defeated [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan for the GOP nomination to be speaker and replaced, of course, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=16.56s)]
*  ousted Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But Republicans then delayed a House vote to try to confirm [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=23.12s)]
*  Scalise because he doesn't have the 217 votes he needs to officially be elected. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=29.12s)]
*  The New York Times is pointing out that several Republican lawmakers announced that they would [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=36.64s)]
*  not back Scalise on the House floor without concessions, complaining of a rushed process [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=41.68s)]
*  to choose a new speaker and voicing skepticism that he could unite their conference. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=47.92s)]
*  NBC News in our informal county notes at least eight holdouts against Scalise, including [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=54.56s)]
*  Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Chip Roy of Texas, Max Miller of Ohio, and Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=61.68s)]
*  of Georgia. Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado, meanwhile, voted present during the nomination [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=68.48s)]
*  process yesterday. He said neither Scalise nor Jordan would clearly say if they believe [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=74.8s)]
*  the 2020 election was legitimate, something Buck insists the next speaker must do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=81.28s)]
*  As for when a vote on the House floor could finally take place, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=88.8s)]
*  Democratic leadership tells NBC News they anticipate about an hour's heads up from [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=92.48s)]
*  Republicans when they're ready to vote. So who knows when that will be? Interim Speaker Patrick [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=97.44s)]
*  McHenry said members could get as little as 15 minutes lead time, but lots of twists and turns [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  ahead today, potentially tomorrow on Capitol Hill. Joining us now, congressional reporter for the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=108.56s)]
*  Hill, Michael Schnell. Michael, great to see you again. You've been doing such hard work for us [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=115.2s)]
*  this week. First of all, let's go back to yesterday and walk us through how the nomination battle [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  played out behind closed doors. Scalise and Jordan both whipping votes. It was seen as being [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=126.88s)]
*  very close for a while, but then Scalise emerged. That's exactly right, Jonathan. Going into that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  door meeting, there was no clear front runner in this race. Both Scalise and Jordan had picked up [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  a significant amount of endorsements. A number of lawmakers were withholding who they were going to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  vote for behind closed doors. But as you mentioned, eventually Scalise came out victorious. But there [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=149.12s)]
*  was a key moment that happened before that vote on the speaker nominee. Essentially what House [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=154.16s)]
*  Republicans did was they voted to kill a proposal to change the House to change the conference rules [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=159.12s)]
*  that would have increased the threshold needed for the speaker to win the nomination. So right [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=165.28s)]
*  now, and as it currently stands, it's at least a majority of the conference. Some lawmakers wanted [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=170.16s)]
*  to increase that to two 17 members to make sure that they can avoid that public floor fight like [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=174.8s)]
*  we saw back in January. But that rule ultimately went down. Lawmakers voted to table it, which was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=180.08s)]
*  sort of seen as a win for Scalise. And then minutes later, Scalise ended up winning the nomination [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  from his conference 113 to 99, a significant hurdle in this race to become speaker. But as you laid out, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=191.12s)]
*  he does not have this thing locked up yet. House Republicans have been unable to go to the floor [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  yet with Scalise's nomination because they don't yet have the votes to win the gavel on the House [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=203.12s)]
*  floor. So Michael, what are your sources telling you as to when that might happen? When might we [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=207.84s)]
*  get this vote? And what is Scalise doing and his team doing right now to try to rally support? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=214.56s)]
*  Right now, it's unclear. The House is set to reconvene today at noon. So that is the earliest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  that we can see a vote on House Speaker. But right now, as it stands, I don't think that we're going [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=226.8s)]
*  to be seeing a vote that quickly. As you mentioned before, my vote tally is the same as you. I have [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=231.04s)]
*  at least eight Republicans who have said that they plan to support somebody else other than Steve [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=236.08s)]
*  Scalise. Six of those are supporting Jim Jordan. One is supporting Kevin McCarthy. And then a wild [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=240.72s)]
*  card we saw last night come out. Congressman George Santos says that he's anybody but Scalise. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=246.0s)]
*  So look, if Scalise wants to lock this thing down, and I'll note that those eight are aside from [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=251.2s)]
*  a number of lawmakers who have just outright said they're undecided or have refused to say who they [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=255.6s)]
*  will support. So Scalise has a real uphill battle to be able to clinch the gavel on the House floor. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=260.64s)]
*  What comes next? We'll likely see a number of closed door meetings today between Scalise, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=265.76s)]
*  some of his allies, and of course some of those holdouts to see if there's anything that he can do, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=270.4s)]
*  potentially give them to flip their vote on the House floor. So walk us through the possible [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=275.76s)]
*  future for Scalise. It feels McCarthy-esque where he might face multiple rounds of voting. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  And also, Michael, clarify one thing for us. If once he is or someone becomes Speaker, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  is it still going to just be the same process that we had with McCarthy where just one vote, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=291.36s)]
*  one member could trigger a process that could strip that Speaker of his title? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=296.32s)]
*  Jonathan, it's a little deja vu all over again as you sort of laid out up there because this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=300.88s)]
*  is exactly what we saw happen with Kevin McCarthy back in January. He struggled to lock up the votes [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=305.04s)]
*  after securing the nomination. He struggled to lock up the votes on the House floor and it's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=310.0s)]
*  because of this extremely slim majority that Republicans have in the House. It's only a single [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=314.56s)]
*  digit number, that majority, and I don't give a number exactly because it depends on absences on [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  the day and that can change. But Republicans have a very slim majority, which means that as the same [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=324.88s)]
*  was in January, if Steve Scalise wants to lock up the Speakership on the House floor, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=330.08s)]
*  House Republicans are going to have to be nearly unanimous to give him the gavel and for him to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=335.44s)]
*  win. And in any scenario, it's difficult sometimes to get Republicans on the same page, but especially [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=341.03999999999996s)]
*  when you're dealing with this very slim margin. So when you talk about him locking up the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=346.08s)]
*  Speakership, it's going to be difficult because of that slim majority. But then I think it's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  likely that if Steve Scalise does eventually get the gavel after how many days, maybe weeks it takes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=353.52s)]
*  for him to negotiate over it, we will likely see Steve Scalise have some of these same legislative [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=358.88s)]
*  issues that Kevin McCarthy had in terms of the right flank, pushing him to the right, conservatives [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  digging in their heels on different legislative pushes and maybe delaying and, you know, adding [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=369.36s)]
*  some drama to legislation in the House. Because again, it all comes down to that extremely slim [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=373.76s)]
*  majority that House Republicans have in the chamber. Yeah, and if this process goes on and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  if rounds of voting go forth and he can't gather the support, one might wonder if other candidates [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=383.52s)]
*  for Speaker may emerge. Lots of drama ahead. Congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=388.72s)]
*  Chanel, thank you as always for guiding us through it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM3hurQvcnQ&t=393.44000000000005s)]
