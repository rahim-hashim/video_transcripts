# U.S. and allies launch strikes against Houthis in Yemen
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8)
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=0.0s)]
*  He serves on the Armed Services Committee and is a combat veteran who served four tours [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=4.64s)]
*  with the U.S. Marines. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=10.1s)]
*  Congressman, really great to see you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=11.92s)]
*  Thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=14.0s)]
*  Good to see you, Jonathan. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=15.0s)]
*  Let's start simply with this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=16.8s)]
*  Some of your colleagues in Congress raised objections that the administration carried [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=17.84s)]
*  out these strikes without congressional approval. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=21.72s)]
*  Do you share that concern, or do you feel like these strikes were appropriately ordered? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=23.96s)]
*  No, the strikes were unquestionably ordered appropriately by the president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=28.44s)]
*  Look, I think that Congress has an important role in deciding whether to go to war. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=32.64s)]
*  That's very clear, and I've taken that position many times in the past. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  But what the president has done is clearly defined under law when the president is allowed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=41.28s)]
*  to respond unilaterally to threats against the United States, and then there is a very [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=46.2s)]
*  strict congressional notification requirement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  He has 48 hours to notify Congress. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=53.84s)]
*  He has 60 days to make sure the strikes are stopped before he comes back to Congress for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=55.94s)]
*  additional permission. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=63.739999999999995s)]
*  He's following all that to the letter of the law, so he's doing the right thing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=65.58s)]
*  He's protecting U.S. interests, and he's following the U.S. Constitution. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=69.46s)]
*  So let's talk about the impact then of these strikes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=72.78s)]
*  Do you believe that they were warranted? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=76.82s)]
*  But more than that, do you think that they will work? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=78.74s)]
*  Do you think this will deter Houthis from attacking further ships in the Red Sea? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=80.74s)]
*  And also, as a second part to that, what is your concern now that this could actually [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=85.14s)]
*  lead to a wider conflict in the region? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=89.06s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, I think you've picked an important word there, which is deter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=91.22s)]
*  That's exactly what the president is trying to do. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=95.7s)]
*  He's trying to deter further attacks. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=97.86s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=100.3s)]
*  These are terrorist attacks against defenseless civilian ships, defenseless international [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=101.5s)]
*  crews. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=107.94s)]
*  And what the president is doing is saying, we will not stand for terrorism, and we are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=108.94s)]
*  going to deter further attacks and, I would argue, deter escalation of this conflict by [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=113.22000000000001s)]
*  responding. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=120.26s)]
*  So a lot of critics have said this is escalation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=121.26s)]
*  I think it's deterrence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  A lot of critics have said the president's not following the Constitution. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  Actually, he's following it to the letter of the law. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=128.54000000000002s)]
*  And a lot of critics have said this could result in a wider regional war. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=131.5s)]
*  The president is keenly aware of that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=135.36s)]
*  He's keenly aware of that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=136.94s)]
*  And he's taking strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, against the militant groups in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  Iraq, to deter an escalation of conflict that, let's be clear, has been started by [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=143.06s)]
*  these militant groups. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=148.26s)]
*  So Congressman, as you sit on the Armed Services Committee, I also wanted to ask you around [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=149.9s)]
*  the controversy surrounding Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  The Office of the Inspector General at the Pentagon announced that it will conduct a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=157.3s)]
*  review of Secretary Austin's hospitalization, saying yesterday in a memo that the review's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=160.94s)]
*  purpose is to examine the details behind the secretary's time in the hospital. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=166.34s)]
*  He's still there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=170.58s)]
*  And how transparent the Department of Defense was about his stay and about how the Defense [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=171.82s)]
*  Secretary and the Department itself failed to notify U.S. officials and the White House [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=176.7s)]
*  until several days after Austin was admitted. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=181.94s)]
*  We should note the top two members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democrat [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=184.7s)]
*  Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Republican Robert Wicker of Mississippi, sent a letter to Austin [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=189.16s)]
*  asking for a briefing following the review. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=194.54s)]
*  So what do you think, Congressman? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=198.22s)]
*  Did the Secretary handle this appropriately? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  And do you think there should be any repercussions that he would need to face? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=203.78s)]
*  He did not handle this appropriately. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=208.46s)]
*  It's totally unacceptable. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=209.98s)]
*  You can't have the highest levels of our military chain of command unaware that a senior official [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=211.5s)]
*  is indisposed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=218.38s)]
*  And look, I served as a United States Marine lieutenant, a platoon commander, at the lowest [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  level of the officer chain of command, and I cannot imagine this happening at that level. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=225.62s)]
*  I mean, all of us who just work in jobs where we have a reporting chain, we know that if [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  we don't show up, we've got to let our boss know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=235.46s)]
*  I mean, that's just common sense. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  So we all care about Secretary Austin and his family. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=240.34s)]
*  I mean, my grandfather died of prostate cancer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  We all are concerned about his health. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  But he has a responsibility inherent in his job, a national security responsibility to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  the United States to report to the President, and he failed to do that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=252.58s)]
*  That has to have consequences. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=256.82s)]
*  And Congressman, let's also ask you about the situation in Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=258.78s)]
*  It's been nearly 100 days since more than 240 people were taken captive from Israel. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=261.62s)]
*  More than 100 hostages still remain. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=268.41999999999996s)]
*  There's yet to be any sort of deal to get them out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=270.82s)]
*  What is your sense right now about the ongoing state of negotiations? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=273.34s)]
*  There's still some discussions happening there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=278.38s)]
*  I know there's been some concern about whether the amount of aid reaching Gaza is enough. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=280.78s)]
*  The administration certainly urged Israel to be more targeted in its strikes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=285.18s)]
*  From what you're hearing from the Netanyahu government, what do you think of their vision, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=290.86s)]
*  not just for this next phase of the war, but what comes after for Gaza? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=294.5s)]
*  Well, I said at the very beginning of this conflict that Prime Minister Netanyahu needs [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  an end game. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  And an end game means a political resolution to this conflict, a political future that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  can be understood and envisioned by Israelis, by the troops who are literally risking their [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=310.02s)]
*  lives on the ground fighting the Hamas terrorists, and by the people of Gaza who have to buy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=314.44s)]
*  into a peaceful political future or else this will just be an endless war for Israel. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=319.7s)]
*  So it's easy to forget that as this war has escalated after the heinous, barbaric attacks [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=324.88s)]
*  of October 7th, that there are still over 100 hostages in captivity, that there's no [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=332.0s)]
*  end in sight to the conflict, and that at the end of the day, we can't be back where [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=337.96s)]
*  we started. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=343.02s)]
*  We've got to have a political resolution to this that gives a future to the Palestinian [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  people and security to both the Palestinians and the Israelis. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=348.46s)]
*  And Congressman, very briefly last night, I just want to circle back to the Defense Secretary. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=353.34s)]
*  You said repercussions would be warranted. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=356.26s)]
*  Do you think he should keep his job? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=358.52s)]
*  Look, that's a decision for the Commander-in-Chief, but the Commander-in-Chief of the United [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=360.29999999999995s)]
*  States needs to send a clear and decisive message that this will never happen again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=364.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=370.02s)]
*  Well, we appreciate your time this morning covering a lot of ground with us. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=371.02s)]
*  And I'd like to thank Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=373.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=375.74s)]
*  Certainly we will speak again soon. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=376.74s)]
*  Good to see you, Jonathan. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=377.74s)]
*  You, the same. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWap9Slgay8&t=378.74s)]
