# Texas rep. wins runoff election after showdown with far-right challenger
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk)
*  Republican Congressman Tony Gonzalez of Texas narrowly defeated a far-right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=0.0s)]
*  challenger in his GOP primary runoff election last night. Gonzalez, who [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  represents the town of Vivalde, faced attacks from members of his own party [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=9.56s)]
*  after voting in favor of gun safety legislation and a measure that protected [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=13.6s)]
*  same-sex marriage. Despite a massive fundraising operation, Gonzalez's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=17.8s)]
*  victory was exceedingly tight, with all precincts reporting he led by just about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=22.8s)]
*  400 votes. Gonzalez supporters had warned that a loss could open the door for [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=27.6s)]
*  Democrats to flip the district in November. His win now bolsters Republican [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  efforts to potentially hold the House, though most experts think they're [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=36.92s)]
*  still the underdog to do that. Joining us now to talk more on this is MSNBC [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=40.68s)]
*  political analyst Brandon Buck. He was communications strategist and former aide [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  to House speakers Ryan and Boehner. Brandon, good to see you this morning. So [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  let's talk about Tony Gonzalez. This is his first race since he was censored by the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=52.88s)]
*  state GOP last year. He squeaked out a win. What lessons can we learn from last [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  night? Yeah, I think it shows just how narrow the hold is that the sort of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  governance party of the Republican Party has. I mean, his opponent here is a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=69.08s)]
*  YouTube content creator. I mean, I think it's a perfect symbol for where the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=73.28s)]
*  party is right now. You know, sort of the entertainment politics, anything to get [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=77.12s)]
*  clicks versus somebody who was trying to govern. And Tony Gonzalez had set [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=81.92s)]
*  a real record of sort of shutting the far right and doing what he thinks is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=86.52s)]
*  right, whether it's same sex marriage, as you said, gun control, but also things [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=92.0s)]
*  just like funding the government and, you know, so the basic operations that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=97.0s)]
*  all of the Freedom Caucus types in Congress dislike. You know, you could say [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  it's a victory for governance, but it was really narrow. And it's, you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=105.08s)]
*  it's a type of thing. You wonder why do Republicans not support gun control? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=109.04s)]
*  It's things like this. You might narrowly lose your primary to somebody [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=113.64s)]
*  who moves in out of state and talks about a K 15s all the time. It's a very [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  tenuous hold right now that the governance wing has. And I don't know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  that it's all that encouraging going forward, to be honest. Yeah, the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=126.56s)]
*  market continues to surge throughout most of the Republican Party. So [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=129.56s)]
*  Gonzalez's challenger was backed by Republican congressman and Freedom [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=134.8s)]
*  Caucus chair Bob Good, who himself, Donald Trump, just turned on. We saw, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=138.4s)]
*  as mentioned earlier in the show, Trump endorsed goods challenger in the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=143.6s)]
*  primary. Give us your read as to where that can tell us about the state of the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  GOP. Sure. And just to note how dysfunctional it is that you have all [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=151.6s)]
*  of these members targeting their colleagues in primaries is a thing that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=156.56s)]
*  would have never happened even 567 years ago. But yeah, Bob Good is the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=159.88s)]
*  chairman of the Freedom Caucus, the leader of the most far right caucus in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=164.48s)]
*  the House. And yet that doesn't seem to matter in a Republican primary right [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=169.48s)]
*  now. It really matters is do you have Donald Trump's seal of approval? Bob [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=174.44s)]
*  Good endorsed Ron DeSantis in the primary instead of Donald Trump, and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=179.38s)]
*  he's been trying to get back in his good graces ever since. He went up to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=183.28s)]
*  New York and tried to be there for the trial to show how much he loves him. But [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=188.0s)]
*  it's really depressing situation where you can be as conservative as you want, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  and that doesn't matter as long as Donald Trump doesn't like you. It may not [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  ultimately decide the race. I think Bob Good will potentially lose for a lot of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=204.96s)]
*  other reasons. He's not a very effective member of Congress. He's not very good [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  at communicating. But it is a significant symbol to me that Donald Trump's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=213.0s)]
*  endorsement is key above anything else ideologically. Yeah, it's a really, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=218.08s)]
*  really good point. So, Brendan, we are just hours from now when the jury will [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=222.92s)]
*  start deliberating the fate of Donald Trump, the former president of the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=228.48s)]
*  United States. We may be later today. Next couple of days, we'll get a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  verdict. I know you speak to Republicans of all stripes all the time. What [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=236.72s)]
*  is their read as to how this not the jury do, but how the what the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=241.32s)]
*  political implications would be of a conviction and acquittal or hung jury? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=246.76s)]
*  What are they saying in how that might impact a very tight race this November? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=250.76s)]
*  It's remarkable how little people are concerned about it. This is could be one [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=255.32s)]
*  of the biggest moments in presidential history. And I think people are still [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  shrugging at it. There have been so many times where we are told that this is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=265.2s)]
*  going to be the moment that everything falls apart for Donald Trump and people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  just don't believe it. Certainly, I don't think that this is a good thing for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=273.76s)]
*  Donald Trump. And don't get me wrong that he won't pay some price. But he has done [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=278.72s)]
*  such a good job convincing people that everything is illegitimate, that people [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=282.56s)]
*  are out to get him and that you can't trust anything. And his entire strategy [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  is built around turning out base, not appealing to the middle, that the effects [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  I think are going to be relatively small. And if we know anything about Donald [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=296.0s)]
*  Trump, he'll he'll make himself a victim and try to make something positive out [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  of it for himself. Maybe that's a false sense of confidence for Republicans. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=303.88s)]
*  This could be earth shaking, earth shattering if he is convicted. But you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  would not think so given the calm nature that you hear from a lot of Republicans [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=315.0s)]
*  right now. Yeah, the Republicans I speak to say the same. This is sort of baked [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=319.28s)]
*  in. They know who Trump is. They don't think this will change much. With the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=322.4s)]
*  Biden campaign, they agree it's not a major event. But even if it moves some [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=325.36s)]
*  voters on the margins in a tight race in some swing states, that might be enough. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=329.56s)]
*  So we'll all be watching [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qip3j-AlMwk&t=333.52s)]
