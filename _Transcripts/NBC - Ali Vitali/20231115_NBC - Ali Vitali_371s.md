# House passes stopgap bill to avert government shutdown
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk)
*  Potential government shutdown in just two days is now looking a lot less likely this morning after the House passed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=0.0s)]
*  new speaker Mike Johnson's unconventional stopgap funding bill yesterday, largely with the help of Democrats. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=7.92s)]
*  The two-step plan was approved on a bipartisan vote of 336 to 95. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=16.96s)]
*  That means 209 Democrats as opposed to just 127 Republicans voted in favor of it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=24.24s)]
*  93 Republicans and just two Democrats voted against. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=33.12s)]
*  The move essentially punts the Republican spending fight until after the holidays. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=37.28s)]
*  Speaker Johnson told reporters he was pleased with the outcome. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Your first big bill, sir, how does it feel? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=48.32s)]
*  We just had to get the job done, day by day. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=51.28s)]
*  Any concern about the number of Republican defections there were? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=53.28s)]
*  We'll get our team together and run the agenda. We're ready to do that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=56.32s)]
*  How do you get your team together from here? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=59.36s)]
*  You'll see. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=61.36s)]
*  So the measure does not include any spending cuts or any additional conservative policy add-ons. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=63.36s)]
*  But importantly, it also does not include a supplemental package covering things like aid for Israel and Ukraine or additional U.S. border security. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=70.32s)]
*  The bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to then pass it on to President Biden's desk by Friday night for his signature to keep the government open. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=81.44s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional reporter for Politico and lead writer for the huddle newsletter, which you should all be reading, Daniella Diaz. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=91.44s)]
*  Good morning. Thanks for being here with us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=100.4s)]
*  So let's start there with that unusual vote totals that this bill passed the House largely with the help of Democrats, far more Democrats, voting for it than Republicans. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=102.44000000000001s)]
*  How did that come about? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  Well, it came about because this legislation to keep the government funded until January doesn't include any spending cuts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  I spoke to countless Republicans this week, Jonathan, Republican House members who were telling me that they wanted to see some sort of spending cuts included in this package. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=121.44s)]
*  Of course, a lot of conservatives giving Speaker Johnson this leeway right now because he's in this tricky position where he just became speaker two and a half weeks ago. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=131.48s)]
*  I'm losing track. It's only been about a minute, it feels like. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=141.48s)]
*  And he he had to figure out how to fund the government pretty quickly. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=145.48s)]
*  And he knew that he needed Democratic votes to be able to do this because a lot of his own conference doesn't want to support a continuing resolution to fund the government unless it has cuts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=148.48s)]
*  And if it does have cuts, that's going to be a problem in the Senate because it's a Democratic majority and President Joe Biden probably wouldn't sign that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  So this is how he had to do it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's why we saw that that happened yesterday. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  I want to say last night because it happened around 5 p.m. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  Where more Democrats supported this than Republicans, which we're going to see as a talking point from a lot of these conservatives in the coming days. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  So let's drill down on that a little bit. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  Of course, it was a vote to keep the government open that cost. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, his speakership. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=186.56s)]
*  Now we've got Speaker Johnson doing the same, getting Democrats on board. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=188.56s)]
*  How angry are some of the hardline Republicans or any of them going to try to oust Speaker Johnson from his job? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=192.56s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, Jonathan, is these conservatives and when I say conservatives, these House Freedom Caucus members who I've been speaking to are really giving Speaker Johnson some room. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=199.56s)]
*  They're furious, of course, as you noted. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=209.56s)]
*  But they understand that Johnson just came into this job two weeks ago. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=211.6s)]
*  He's actually never ran a committee. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=215.6s)]
*  He was not an appropriator. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=217.6s)]
*  He is new to all of this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=219.6s)]
*  As he noted, he feels like he's drinking from Niagara Falls. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=221.6s)]
*  That's how overwhelmed he is in this role. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=224.6s)]
*  And so we're seeing them give him some grace. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=226.6s)]
*  However, he did lose some grace with some of these guys just yesterday with this CR passage and mostly Democrats supporting this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=229.6s)]
*  And they say that it only goes so far. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=237.6s)]
*  So he has already committed to only doing this once, keeping government funded without any cuts once. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=239.64s)]
*  He said he won't do this again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=245.64s)]
*  And they're going to be working for the next couple of weeks, couple of months to keep passing these appropriations bills that will fund the government and cut spending. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=247.64s)]
*  That's what he's committed to. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=255.64s)]
*  I'm not quite sure the political wisdom of kicking a government shutdown fight into an election year, but we'll come to that when it happens. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=257.64s)]
*  But right now, though, what this bill does not have is money for Ukraine, Israel, the border. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=263.68s)]
*  And you've been writing on this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=268.68s)]
*  So what happens next? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=270.68s)]
*  When might, if at all, the Congress supply this aid to U.S. allies in need? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=272.68s)]
*  Well, and while this continuing resolution, this stopgap measure to fund the government was happening yesterday, meanwhile, in the Senate, some conservatives and senators were actually trying to pass [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=278.68s)]
*  Israel-only funding, trying to get that House bill that they passed, passed in the Senate. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=288.72s)]
*  That obviously did not end up happening. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=293.72s)]
*  There was not enough support for that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=295.72s)]
*  But Republican senators do not want Ukraine, conservatives, I should say, do not want Ukraine aid. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=297.72s)]
*  They want to pass the Israel aid without Ukraine aid. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=304.72s)]
*  That's what we see from a lot of the House GOP conference. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=306.72s)]
*  But Democratic leadership in the Senate is committed to creating a huge supplemental package that requests coming from the White House. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=309.72s)]
*  And they are waiting to see if they can include some sort of border measures, Jonathan. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  And that's why we haven't seen that measure passed in the Senate yet. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=322.76000000000005s)]
*  And they're hoping that if it does include some bipartisan border measures, right now there's a group working on that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine aid, Israel aid, they can pass that with bipartisan support in the Senate and kind of force the House's hand on that issue. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  However, right now, it doesn't look like they're anywhere close to doing that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  It's going to take a while. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=340.76000000000005s)]
*  They certainly will. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=341.76000000000005s)]
*  We'll be watching every step of the way. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=342.76000000000005s)]
*  Terrific reporting and analysis from Politico's Daniela Diaz. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=344.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdLndso1Nk&t=347.8s)]
