# Ron DeSantis administration officials solicit campaign cash from lobbyists
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4)
*  Welcome back. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign says it raised just over $8 million in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=0.0s)]
*  first 24 hours after announcing his candidacy. The Florida governor launched his bid for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=7.2s)]
*  the White House on Wednesday over a very glitchy livestream on Twitter Spaces. While some supporters [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=12.88s)]
*  are admitting that the announcement itself was a flop, others have sought to spin the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=19.36s)]
*  technical struggles as enthusiasm for the Florida governor. His campaign, turning the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=23.84s)]
*  page, now focused on how to defeat Donald Trump in the Republican primary, though they haven't [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=29.48s)]
*  really started any attacks yet. Yesterday, DeSantis' strategists met with donors in Miami to lay out [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  their vision for the next year. NBC News reports several attendees say the governor's campaign is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=38.76s)]
*  banking on Trump being dragged down by his legal woes. Meanwhile, people who work for [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=44.28s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis' gubernatorial administration and not his presidential campaign have been [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=50.84s)]
*  reportedly soliciting Florida lobbyists for political contributions for DeSantis' presidential bid. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=56.76s)]
*  That's according to NBC News, which reviewed text messages sent from four administration officials [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=63.48s)]
*  to those lobbyists. A number of attorneys and other lobbyists who spoke to NBC News called the move [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  potentially illegal, at the very least a serious breach of ethics. The governor's office did not [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  return a request for comment, but one administration official acknowledged they were fundraising [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=81.16s)]
*  for the campaign. Let's now bring in one of the reporters on that story, NBC News senior [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=86.6s)]
*  national politics reporter, Jonathan Allen. Jonathan, great to see you again. Let's start [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  with those text messages. I mean, how damaging could this be? There should be, right, the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=96.36s)]
*  government ethics and law of right line between politics, campaigns, administrations, official [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=101.56s)]
*  government work. How do you see this plan out? Well, let me zoom out just a little bit from that, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  Jon, as far as the legal question, you know, we'll have to let Florida authorities, the Florida [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=113.0s)]
*  administration perhaps look into that, the administration of Ron DeSantis, of course. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=119.8s)]
*  But to zoom out just a little bit, this is a candidate who has come into the race saying [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  that he's going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. And one of the first things that happens [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=128.04s)]
*  after he gets into the race is people in his own administration, and we're talking, you know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=133.32s)]
*  relatively high level people here soliciting donations from lobbyists who have business before [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  the government. And at a time when Florida's budget is not yet resolved, and what does that mean? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  It means that Ron DeSantis has not yet figured out which projects he's going to line at a veto. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  Our colleague Matt Dixon talked to a bunch of lobbyists in Florida yesterday who were, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  you know, horrified by this and also not just the, you know, the sort of question of the ethics of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=160.44000000000003s)]
*  it, but also, you know, for their own interests, worried about whether or not they gave or gave [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=166.44s)]
*  enough. Some observers certainly would point out that DeSantis has used his office for political [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  purposes quite a bit in the last couple years. That's sort of his whole ethos, so we'll see where [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=179.48s)]
*  this goes. But let's take a, let's talk about the week in DeSantis, John. It's well covered [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=183.32s)]
*  that that was the lives, the Twitter spaces, the other thing was pretty glitchy. Bad news, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=189.32s)]
*  the good news though, that eight million dollar fundraising hall, that's a huge number, frankly, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=194.68s)]
*  better than Trump's been doing. Talk to us about it. Yeah, it's a big one-day number. It's bigger [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=199.32s)]
*  than the first six weeks of the Trump campaign. On the other hand, the bar of expectation for [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=203.8s)]
*  Ron DeSantis was so high because for the first, you know, basically five months of this year, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=209.72s)]
*  people expected him to get in, they talked about the juggernaut that he was going to be on the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  fundraising level. And, you know, what we've seen so far is there's going to be a lot of focus on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=219.96s)]
*  the super PAC, which is saying that it's going to have a budget of about 200 million dollars, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  obviously far more than the 8.2 million raised for the campaign proper. I think if you look at [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=230.12s)]
*  the DeSantis week so far, you know, if he comes back and wins, it's from a very low point on that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=235.16s)]
*  launch. And, you know, at the same time, I think, you know, if he loses, people will look back at [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=242.52s)]
*  this first week and say not that he lost because of it, but because that it was somewhat indicative [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=247.48s)]
*  of other problems around him, not foreseeing the potential problems of a Twitter launch [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  and things like that. The field may grow further in the days ahead. Mike Pence room to be jumping [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=257.4s)]
*  in. Doug Bergen, the governor of North Dakota, thinking of jumping in. We also are still waiting [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=261.64s)]
*  to hear from Chris Christie and Chris Sununu, governor of New Hampshire. One more query, John. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=265.8s)]
*  Give us the latest as how Democrats are feeling about how President Biden and his poll numbers [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=270.28s)]
*  stand as this race really starts to begin in earnest. Yeah, they don't love where Joe Biden [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=274.44s)]
*  stands right now, but many of them feel confident that he will defeat Donald Trump again. And right [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=280.6s)]
*  now with Donald Trump polling at over 50 percent in the Republican primary and virtually every [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=285.64s)]
*  national poll, they expect that that's who Biden will face off against. So they feel comfortable [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=290.6s)]
*  with that matchup, even if they don't love the matchup. Of course, Biden's still in polls of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=295.72s)]
*  Democrats. You know, most of them seem to prefer that there was somebody else on the horizon, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=300.92s)]
*  but there obviously is no one else on the horizon. They're ready to vote for over him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=306.04s)]
*  There is no one else on the horizon. That is for sure. And also Donald Trump's path may indeed be [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=310.92s)]
*  complicated if further indictments are coming and coming potentially soon. NBC News, senior [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=315.48s)]
*  national poll reporter Jonathan Allen. Thank you, my friend. Have a good weekend. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mipO_mWLC4&t=320.12s)]
