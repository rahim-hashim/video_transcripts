# White House says about 20,000 federal workers have accepted 'buyout' offer so far
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ)
*  Welcome back. A spokesperson for the office of personnel management says more than 20,000 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=0.0s)]
*  federal employees have accepted the buyout offer put forward by the Trump administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=6.4s)]
*  The OPM office says the number of resignations has been rapidly growing ahead of tomorrow's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=11.56s)]
*  deadline. Meanwhile, unions representing government employees have filed a lawsuit to block the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=16.28s)]
*  plan, calling the buyout offer arbitrary and capricious, saying it violates federal law. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=21.16s)]
*  They also allege the administration can't guarantee the plan will be funded. We've actually [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=27.08s)]
*  heard that from lawmakers. And that the plan has failed to consider the consequences of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=30.68s)]
*  mass resignations and how it may affect the government's ability to function. Joining [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=34.68s)]
*  us now, Democratic congressman of Virginia, Suhas Subramaniam. Suhas, thank you for joining [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=39.4s)]
*  us. Congressman, I think the question is, I think they have considered what the impact [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  of mass resignations will be because they seem to be fine with downsizing government [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=49.72s)]
*  at whatever cost. But you were at the Treasury Department yesterday, part of a very large [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=54.68s)]
*  protest. Talk about what you saw there and what it might portend for the future as the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=60.2s)]
*  Trump administration continues these kinds of efforts. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=64.0s)]
*  Sure. You know, what I saw wasn't just federal workers protesting. It was everyday people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=66.48s)]
*  who understand the impact of losing the federal workforce would have on them and their families. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=71.36s)]
*  And so, you know, I have a lot of federal workers in my district. We had a town hall [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=76.68s)]
*  a couple of days ago, but it was actually mostly people who are not federal workers [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=80.0s)]
*  who are worried about their food safety, that worried about their benefits if they're veterans, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=83.64s)]
*  just worried about our country's ability to function in general without federal workers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=87.72s)]
*  And so I think everyone is starting to see this, starting to feel the impact of what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  could happen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=95.52s)]
*  I think the reminder that sometimes people need when they talk about government, which [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=96.52s)]
*  is some big faceless entity, is that it's made up of people. Right? So talk about the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  conversations that you're having with members of your community who are federal workers [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=105.36s)]
*  saying, I'm just still trying to pay my mortgage, feed my family, go to work every day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=109.32s)]
*  There was one woman who is a nuclear physicist and she actually is going to leave her job. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=113.88s)]
*  And how do you replace a nuclear physicist? There's very few people with her expertise, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  with her experience in government and a very critical role. Think about that times thousands [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=125.82s)]
*  and thousands of jobs all across the country, all across the world sometimes, like in certain [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=130.76s)]
*  We're going to be having a brain drain in the federal government. And this I call it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=136.16s)]
*  the dumb sizing, not the downsizing of federal government. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=139.72s)]
*  You know, we're fellow Virginian. I think it was Mark Warner who said this, that the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  government at this point is only funded through March 14th and the appropriations don't include [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=146.08s)]
*  a massive buyout package. I mean, is this thing even firm? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=150.88s)]
*  No, it's not. And that's what I keep telling people is don't trust it. Like, make sure [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=154.36s)]
*  the money is there first. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=158.52s)]
*  And it's not just because it's the Trump administration and it seems kind of chaotic. Like, there's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=159.52s)]
*  reasons not to trust it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=163.16s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. And, you know, we don't have the appropriations there. But more importantly, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=165.0s)]
*  we don't want people leaving who have really good expertise in government. And if you leave, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=168.6s)]
*  you know, we don't know if we can take care of you through the end of that term. And so [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=173.2s)]
*  we're telling people to stay. If you're planning to leave anyway, you know, make the decision [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=177.44s)]
*  for yourself. But really a lot of people with expertise that we really need and who can [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=181.78s)]
*  be in the government for a long time should stay and consider their options. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=185.9s)]
*  Yeah, that is a point that I've heard repeatedly from folks who are nervous about what this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=189.44s)]
*  kind of move does. I've also heard rumblings, though, from the Hill that this battle over [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=194.14s)]
*  money that's been appropriated by Congress now being ignored or frozen or gotten rid [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=200.42s)]
*  of altogether could mean something more for the larger government funding fight that we [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=205.05999999999997s)]
*  have in mid-March. Are you hearing conversations among your colleagues about Democrats not [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=209.94s)]
*  wanting to work together with Republicans on funding the government because congressional [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=214.77999999999997s)]
*  appropriations seem to be ignored anyway? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=218.7s)]
*  Yeah, it depends on what kind of package they put together, first of all. But, you know, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=220.78s)]
*  right now they're not showing a willingness to work with us. And so, you know, it's a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=225.82000000000002s)]
*  two-way street. We've said from the very beginning, we'll be bipartisan. We want to get things [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=229.34s)]
*  done and work together. But, you know, right now this is a time where they are being openly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=233.54000000000002s)]
*  hostile towards really a lot of our priorities. And so if they want our vote, they're going [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  to have to earn it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=243.18s)]
*  And right now it seems like Democrats are not inclined to do that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=244.18s)]
*  Not really, no. Not right now. But, you know, we'll see if they change their tune. We'll [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=248.38s)]
*  see if things change. Certainly, I don't want a government shutdown. That affects my area [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=251.14s)]
*  in Virginia deeply because that's a recession for our economy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=256.34s)]
*  Yeah, I've covered shutdowns before. I've spent a lot of time in areas of Virginia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  In your district, it definitely keenly hits there and across the country. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=264.9s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramaniam of Virginia, also a Tulane alumni, I have to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=269.26s)]
*  say. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=273.7s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=274.7s)]
*  Always good. Roll wave. Thank you for joining. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=275.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DV4sL6BheQ&t=277.42s)]
