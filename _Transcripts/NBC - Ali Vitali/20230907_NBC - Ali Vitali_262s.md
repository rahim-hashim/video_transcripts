# DA Willis calls to keep juror identities secret in Georgia election case
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40)
*  Turning back now to the sprawling Georgia election interference case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=0.0s)]
*  Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis has asked the judge to shield the identities of prospective jurors. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=6.0s)]
*  In a new motion that was filed yesterday, Willis asked that the jurors' names be kept secret, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=13.0s)]
*  no photos or video be taken of them, and to bar the publication of any written descriptions of the jurors. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=18.0s)]
*  According to Willis, the move comes after members of the grand jury who indicted Donald Trump and his 19 co-defendants [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=26.0s)]
*  had their personal information posted on conspiracy websites, quote, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=34.0s)]
*  with the intent to harass and intimidate them. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=39.0s)]
*  Joining us now, the founder and president of Public Rights Project, Jill Havik. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=43.0s)]
*  Jill, good to see you this morning. I know you've been working on this and following it closely. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=49.0s)]
*  In a new motion that was filed yesterday, DA Willis, as we just said, asked the judge to keep the jurors' identities secret. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=53.0s)]
*  Tell us if you agree with that step, and if so, why is it so important for not just the safety of the jurors, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=61.0s)]
*  but to be able to conduct a fair trial at all? The jurors can't be accessed by supporters of either side. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=67.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. So I do agree with this move. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=75.0s)]
*  I think it's really important to have the jury feel safe in being part of this trial, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=79.0s)]
*  not only to protect just the integrity of the trial itself, but really to protect the rule of law and the integrity of our legal system writ large. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=86.0s)]
*  We have seen a rise in political violence and threats of violence against public officials across the country over the last several years, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=96.0s)]
*  from volunteers like jurors who are just doing their public service to elected prosecutors, not just Fonny Willis, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=106.0s)]
*  but other prosecutors across the country, especially black women, to even just local election officials who are trying to conduct free and fair elections. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=114.0s)]
*  And so I think it's a smart move and an important one to really keep people safe throughout this trial that's going to be highly charged and highly controversial. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=123.0s)]
*  And we certainly heard from allies of Donald Trump, both in Washington and in the states, on the cases that he's facing, both federal and local, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=133.0s)]
*  trying to claim prosecutorial weaponization, trying to intimidate those involved, and some lawmakers trying to really tip the scales of justice. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=143.0s)]
*  And you've stepped in on that. You're fighting to stop an attempt in Georgia to remove D.A. Willis through a new law that's called SB 92. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=154.0s)]
*  Tell us what that is and talk to us about your efforts and their import. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. So Public Rights Project filed a lawsuit on behalf of a bipartisan coalition of Georgia prosecutors led by D.A. Sherry Boston. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=170.0s)]
*  And we're seeking to overturn SB 92 as unconstitutional. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=180.0s)]
*  What the law does is it creates a partisan prosecuting attorneys oversight commission with the power to investigate, discipline and even remove duly elected prosecutors for over a decade just for doing their jobs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=185.0s)]
*  We think this commission violates the Georgia and the federal constitution on a number of fronts. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=200.0s)]
*  It can retaliate against prosecutors just for their own free speech, for being honest with their voters about their own priorities for public safety. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=206.0s)]
*  And like I said, it can remove prosecutors for 10 years, even though they've been elected for really broad and vague violations such as conduct that, quote, brings the office into disrepute. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=215.0s)]
*  And so we're asking the court to really step in and stop this commission before it can do any further damage. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=226.0s)]
*  Really important work. Please keep us posted on your efforts. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=233.0s)]
*  Founder and president of Public Rights Project, Jill Habeck, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WthMW5q5o40&t=236.0s)]
