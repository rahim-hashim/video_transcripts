# Debt ceiling talks continue; House leaves Washington for Memorial Day weekend
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik)
*  Now, let's turn to the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=0.0s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says talks went better yesterday than they did on Tuesday, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=4.2s)]
*  but that there are still plenty of lingering issues the two sides have to work through. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=9.48s)]
*  Those comments came as House Majority Leader Steve Scalise announced yesterday that members [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=14.24s)]
*  would be allowed to go home for Memorial Day weekend after today's votes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=18.82s)]
*  However, they must return within 24 hours notice if they are needed to vote on any debt [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  limit bill. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=29.4s)]
*  That announcement was met with criticism from House Minority Whip Catherine Clark, the Democrat, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  who called on Republicans to sign on to the Dems' discharge petition for a clean increase [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=35.8s)]
*  that has been signed by their entire caucus. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  I don't know how my colleagues across the aisle who voted for the Default on America [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=46.8s)]
*  Act are going to look our veterans in the eye this Memorial Day. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=52.36s)]
*  You have presented our country with an impossible choice. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=59.8s)]
*  Devastating cuts or devastating default? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=65.44s)]
*  Hungry families or homeless seniors? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=68.64s)]
*  Kids without classrooms or parents without jobs? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=71.16s)]
*  Join us. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=75.48s)]
*  Sign the petition. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=76.48s)]
*  Stay here and fight for American families. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=78.44s)]
*  Fight for their American security. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=81.44s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional correspondent for the New York Times, Luke Broadwater. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=90.4s)]
*  Luke, good morning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=95.4s)]
*  So talk to us at the latest of these negotiations. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=97.4s)]
*  What sticking points remain and has progress indeed been made? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=101.4s)]
*  Well, the biggest sticking point that remains is really they have to agree on the first [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=105.68s)]
*  top line number. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  Republicans want the Democrats to spend less money. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=113.92s)]
*  They want the government to spend less money and the Democrats to agree to it than the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=116.68s)]
*  current spending. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=121.04s)]
*  And that's been a nonstarter for the White House. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=123.12s)]
*  There's inflation in the country, costs go up every year, and to spend less money than [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=129.36s)]
*  the year before would mean, in the Democrats' view, very deep cuts to important programs [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=133.44s)]
*  that everyday Americans rely upon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=139.84s)]
*  So they're not that that has to be agreed to first before anything else can before the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=143.0s)]
*  details can really get worked out. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=149.08s)]
*  But but some of the things that have been on the table, as you put on the screen, are, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=151.2s)]
*  you know, there's been talk of spending caps going forward. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=154.88s)]
*  I think that's one thing that we would likely see in any particular deal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=159.04s)]
*  The Republicans wanted capped at one percent growth per year, which over 10 years would be [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  about three point six trillion dollars less spending by the federal government. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=168.84s)]
*  There are other talks about things like permitting reform, about work requirements. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=175.28s)]
*  But all of those things have to be agreed to only after they can get a top line spending [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=181.68s)]
*  number agreed to. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=185.8s)]
*  Now, certainly the politics of this would be devastating for both parties were the nation [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=187.04s)]
*  to default and both sides suggest the other would take more of the blame. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=192.12s)]
*  But let's just simply is there enough time to avoid this? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=195.8s)]
*  There were some chatter yesterday that really they needed to come to an agreement yesterday, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=198.64s)]
*  no later than today, in order for the process to play out for the House to have enough time [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=202.72s)]
*  to review and vote. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=207.32s)]
*  What do we think, Luke? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=208.32s)]
*  Are we going to get there? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=209.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a really valid concerns, you know, in some ways, this is a game of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=211.16s)]
*  chicken. It's a game of political chicken with real devastating impacts. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=215.72s)]
*  And for a game of chicken to work, the two cars need to be very close to colliding until [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=220.0s)]
*  somebody swerves or backs down. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  And we're getting very, very close to that to that moment. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, if you look back at debt limit crisis in years past, sometimes it did actually [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=232.72s)]
*  have to wait till there was a downgrade in in the credit rating or there was an actual [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=238.0s)]
*  impact in the stock market and people started to lose jobs before there was a deal reached. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=245.0s)]
*  So, you know, I think everyone's sort of holding out hope that it won't it won't get to that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  moment where we do see real, tangible impacts on people, where we see people start getting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=254.32s)]
*  laid off and losing jobs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=259.4s)]
*  But, you know, unfortunately, for Washington to act here, it may be that we need to see [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=261.84s)]
*  some real pain in the American economy before somebody will back down. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=268.48s)]
*  Yeah. And those warning signs starting to appear and later in the show, we're going to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=274.12s)]
*  have an in-depth look as to what it actually would mean globally and for Americans [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=277.68s)]
*  individually if the nation were to default. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=282.24s)]
*  Congressional correspondent for The New York Times, Luke Broadwater, thank you so much [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=284.68s)]
*  for starting us off this morning. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjcjherGIik&t=287.96s)]
