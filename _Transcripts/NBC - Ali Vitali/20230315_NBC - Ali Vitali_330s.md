The state of policing in America

# The state of policing in America
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q)
*  Years after the killing of George Floyd and a summer of Black Lives Matter protests, Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  still believe the country needs to overhaul policing. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=6.92s)]
*  A CBS Ugov poll released last month in the wake of the beating of Tyree Nichols shows [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=10.22s)]
*  a staggering 89 percent feel that at least some changes are needed to police procedures [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=22.3s)]
*  47 percent feel that major changes are needed and only 11 percent say that no changes are [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=24.24s)]
*  needed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Joining us now, professor of sociology at Colby College and former police officer Neil [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  Gross. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=36.64s)]
*  He's the author of the new book, Walk the Walk, How Three Police Chiefs Defied the Odds [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=37.64s)]
*  and Changed Cop Culture. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Neil, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=44.64s)]
*  You are, as just noted, a former police officer, so you're well suited to speak about this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=46.16s)]
*  topic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  There's been this tension between needing to reform police departments, also we're [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=52.84s)]
*  seeing of course crime up in portions of the country in recent years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=57.28s)]
*  Tell us what you have found about what police reforms have been put into place. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  What's effective? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  So, I wrote this book so everyday readers could understand what's happening with policing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  and what's really necessary for reform. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  And I think the way that you framed it is exactly how we normally understand that trade [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=75.54s)]
*  off. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=78.84s)]
*  The more police reform you have, the more crime you're going to have. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=80.84s)]
*  And that's a false narrative. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=83.76s)]
*  The argument that I advance in this book is that police reform actually is a terrific [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  way of reducing crime. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  It's actually one of the most effective ways of reducing crime. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  The more you can increase the trust that citizens have in police, the more they're likely to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=92.68s)]
*  obey the law, the more likely to report information to cops, the better the cops are going to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=97.04s)]
*  be at solving cases. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=101.76s)]
*  So what are some of the methods there that have proven effective in terms of reforms [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=103.64s)]
*  that would lead to, as you say, less crime? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=107.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=111.56s)]
*  So in the book I profile three police chiefs in three different departments. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=112.56s)]
*  One in California, one in Colorado, one in Georgia. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  And all three chiefs made the kind of standard reforms that police department activists have [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=119.8s)]
*  been calling for. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=124.52s)]
*  They all changed use of force policies, all those kinds of things. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=125.52s)]
*  But they also focused on something that we haven't talked nearly enough about in this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  country, and that's cop culture. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=131.92s)]
*  There's a culture that I learned when I was joining the force. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=133.92s)]
*  It was a culture of an us versus them mentality, a focus on danger, the idea that you should [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  never call out your brothers in blue. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  And all three police chiefs recognize that while changing policy is crucially important, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  if you don't change police culture on the ground, none of those changes are going to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=148.04s)]
*  stick. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=151.16s)]
*  So all three did different things to alter that culture, to push it forward in better [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=152.16s)]
*  directions towards social responsibility, toward emphasizing the importance of being [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=155.2s)]
*  humane on the ground, toward the idea of efficiency and professionalism. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=159.44s)]
*  And because of that combination of cultural change and policy change, all three were able [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=163.72s)]
*  to really move the needle on police behavior. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=167.32s)]
*  So on the idea of cop culture, two items there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=169.64000000000001s)]
*  First, how much is race a part of that? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=171.96s)]
*  And then secondly, there were some police departments after George Floyd, in the protests [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  that followed, officers were seemingly less inclined to engage in their jobs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  I do think race is part of the story. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=184.36s)]
*  If you look back at classic studies of police culture, which I touch on really lightly in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=187.24s)]
*  the book, certainly, if you go back to the 50s and 60s, that us versus them mentality [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=191.2s)]
*  was always closely wrapped up with questions of race and racial inequality. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=197.04s)]
*  So as you change cop culture, the more that you talk about ideas like racial reconciliation, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=200.56s)]
*  racial trust building and make that part of the culture, that's crucially important. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=206.56s)]
*  But I think you're also right that after the George Floyd protests, there was some pullback [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=210.64s)]
*  on the part of police departments from everyday behavior on the street, whether that caused [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=214.72s)]
*  an increase in crime or whether the increase in crime that resulted was a consequence of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  the declining trust between police and law enforcement, I think is an open question still. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  So you talk about the three police departments. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  These reforms, should they be done on that level, the local level in each individual [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=232.92s)]
*  jurisdiction or are there things that can be done legislatively, either on the state [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  or federal level? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  The policy change in law enforcement is a complicated matter. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  I think at the federal level, it seems like there's not much chance right now that the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=244.64s)]
*  George Floyd Justice Policing Act is going to pass as a total package. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=248.36s)]
*  It seems like there's some talk about particular bits and pieces of it, maybe getting some [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=253.24s)]
*  leverage across the aisle. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  Most of the reform that has to be done takes place at the state and local level. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=259.92s)]
*  The argument I make in the book, and I think there's really compelling evidence for it, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=263.48s)]
*  is that change in policing is a double-edged sword in this country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=266.76s)]
*  It's a super decentralized system, thousands and thousands of police departments. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=270.48s)]
*  That means that uniform change across the whole system is hard, but it also means that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=274.12s)]
*  there's thousands of departments that can be experimenting with different approaches. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=277.88s)]
*  And the three departments that I highlight, the three chiefs I highlight, they are all [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  experimented. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  They all were kind of creative and innovative, listening to folks in the community who plundered [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  push policing in a different direction. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's time that we elevate the voices and the experiences of departments [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  like that that are really innovating and experimenting. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  It's a crucial and timely read. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=297.23999999999995s)]
*  The new book, Walk the Walk, How Three Police Chiefs Defy the Odds and Change Cop Culture, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=299.28s)]
*  it is out next week. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=304.4s)]
*  Neil Gross, congrats on the book. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=306.56s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbYga-_HN5Q&t=308.0s)]
