# Trump pardons January 6 defendants
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw)
*  We've got more now on those dueling pardons between the outgoing and incoming administrations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=0.0s)]
*  First, newly sworn in President Trump issued roughly 1,500 pardons on his first day in office [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=5.2s)]
*  and commuted the sentences of 14 of his supporters in connection with the January 6th insurrection. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=10.88s)]
*  Trump explained that decision while in the Oval Office yesterday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=16.56s)]
*  So this is January 6th. These are the hostages. Approximately 1,500 for a pardon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=20.96s)]
*  Full pardon. We hope they come out tonight, frankly. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=30.0s)]
*  They're expecting it. Approximately 1,500 people. Six commutations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=35.12s)]
*  We're looking at different things, but the commutations would be the ones that we'll take [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=43.92s)]
*  a look at. Maybe it'll stay that way or it'll go to a full pardon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  This is a new question. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=54.16s)]
*  Should there be punishment for the people who assaulted law enforcement officers that day? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=55.36s)]
*  Well, I will say this. They've been in jail for a long time already. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=59.92s)]
*  I see murderers in this country get two years, one year, and maybe no time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=63.92s)]
*  So they've already been in jail for a long time. These people have been destroyed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=68.24s)]
*  What they've done to these people is outrageous. There's rarely been anything like it in history, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=73.36s)]
*  in the history of our country. And even people that were aggressive, and in many cases, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=78.96s)]
*  I believe they happen to be outside agitators. But what do I know, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=86.63999999999999s)]
*  It all comes after Joe Biden's decision to issue a slew of preemptive pardons in the final hours [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  of his presidency. All of those to protect people that Trump had previously threatened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  They included members of Biden's family, Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  Chairman Mark Milley, and other members and staff of the House January 6th Select Committee. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=107.12s)]
*  Let's bring in MSNBC legal correspondent and former litigator Lisa Rubin. Lisa, I'm so glad [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=114.64s)]
*  you're here this morning because there's so many legal ramifications that I want to get to with you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=119.92s)]
*  But first, your reaction to the pardon of these January 6th defendants, it was everybody, not just [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=124.4s)]
*  the nonviolent offenders that JD Vance and others were trying to use to soften this promise. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  And Ali, JD Vance wasn't the only person who communicated that. That was a message that we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=136.0s)]
*  heard from multiple people associated with Trump world and for weeks. What I was shocked by last [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=140.32s)]
*  night, as you just said, is the breadth of it. When Trump said that he was going to pardon [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=146.32s)]
*  roughly 1,500 people, that still left nearly 100 people. If you talk about the full totality of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=151.12s)]
*  people who have been charged with January 6 crimes, at last count, there are 1,583 of them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=157.04s)]
*  I thought maybe they have a different understanding of what constitutes a violent offense than I do. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=162.0s)]
*  And then I looked at the real language of the executive order and was stunned to find while [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=167.36s)]
*  there weren't just six commutations, as Trump had said from the oval, there were 14. It was a full [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=173.04s)]
*  pardon for anyone committed of any January 6th offense. And with respect to anyone who hasn't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=178.64s)]
*  yet been convicted or tried, there was a directive to the Department of Justice to immediately [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=184.0s)]
*  dismiss those cases and release those people from detention. And then I wonder if we could keep [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=188.8s)]
*  looking at this through the specific January 6th lens, because you turn then to the outgoing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=194.4s)]
*  president's pardons and those that he issued to members of the select committee, including [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  Liz Cheney and the chairman, Benny Thompson, also staff. But you saw something that links not just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=204.16000000000003s)]
*  the actions that Trump took on his pardons, but the preemptive pardons and then what Trump has [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=210.08s)]
*  been saying about what the January 6th committee did or actually didn't do, which is destroy the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=214.72s)]
*  records of their investigation. Can you tie all of this together? Cause nothing happens in a vacuum. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=220.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Trump had a lot of opportunities to talk yesterday, not just in his inaugural [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=224.72s)]
*  address. He obviously talked afterwards in a room off of the Capitol rotunda. And then in the footage [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=229.52s)]
*  that you're showing right now in the oval office, it was sort of this discursive back and forth [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=237.28s)]
*  between signing the papers that his White House staff secretary, Will Sharpe was presenting him [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=241.12s)]
*  with and engaging with members of the press, including our own Peter Alexander. That's when [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=245.44s)]
*  I realized that he was perseverating on something that he had said earlier in the day, that the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  members of the January 6th committee had destroyed documents. Not only is that demonstrably false, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=254.56s)]
*  but what Trump is trying to do here is sell a narrative that these people have committed [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  a crime because it could be a crime to destroy or mutilate or conceal records that are used in a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=265.2s)]
*  government function. In fact, many January 6th defendants were charged with obstruction of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=272.24s)]
*  Congress or obstruction of government functions. Given that what Trump is essentially saying is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=276.8s)]
*  an acceptance of a pardon is an admission of guilt. Well then what does that say about the 1500 people [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=282.96s)]
*  to whom he gave a full pardon or to whom he decided yesterday whose cases shouldn't go [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=288.64s)]
*  forward? What's good for the goose alley here is good for the gander. I reject wholesale, by the way, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=295.2s)]
*  that the members of the January 6th committee and their staffs committed any crime. But if Trump is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=300.24s)]
*  the one accepting the narrative that to pardon someone means that they have done something [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=304.56s)]
*  criminal. In fact, that was the excuse he gave for why he didn't pardon himself. Then he's going to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=308.8s)]
*  have to accept that narrative with respect to all the January 6th defendants too. Yeah, and in terms [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=314.0s)]
*  of the groundwork that he's trying to lay, I remember when Republicans were able to take back [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=319.04s)]
*  control of the House and they asked the committee to preserve its documents so that they could [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=322.96s)]
*  continue working off of them. So certainly that's pretty easy to disprove. I want to pivot to one [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=328.24s)]
*  other thing that Trump did yesterday among a slew of things that he signed was the changes that he's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=333.84s)]
*  trying to make to birthright citizenship in this country. That would be basically changing and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=338.8s)]
*  amending a constitutional amendment through the office of the president. Can you talk about, A, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=344.56s)]
*  can he do that? And B, the way that he's trying to change this rule? Well, first of all, the question [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=349.92s)]
*  of can he do that? The answer should be no. And in fact, Trump knows that because he was asked again [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=355.68s)]
*  in that same Oval Office signing ceremony as the press was looking on, somebody must have said [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=362.56s)]
*  something to him to which he responded, well, that might be right, or you might have a good point. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=368.0s)]
*  He was essentially acknowledging, yeah, this might not be legal, and yet we're going to go ahead and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=372.16s)]
*  try it anyway. The argument that he is making is that some of those born in the United States are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=377.28s)]
*  somehow not subject to the jurisdiction of this country and that both being born here and being [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=383.04s)]
*  subject to the jurisdiction of the country are necessary predicates to birthright citizenship. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=388.32s)]
*  I think he's wrong, but there will be a long and lengthy legal battle. The Trump modus operandi [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=393.52s)]
*  seems to be act first, determine the legality later, and that, as you and I both know, friend, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=399.28s)]
*  is not a sound basis to start a presidency. And certainly that's already beginning. It's what's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=404.64s)]
*  sure to be lengthy court battle. I think two hours it took for folks to start filing suits about that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  And then, of course, Trump himself, on a personal level, is no stranger to legal woes, but are those [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=416.0s)]
*  now all just over? Poof, he's the president again. Well, Ali, you know that when Jack Smith and his [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=421.6s)]
*  team decided not to go forward with those two federal indictments, they dismissed one case with [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=428.48s)]
*  prejudice and withdrew, I'm sorry, without prejudice and withdrew an appeal without prejudice. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=434.24s)]
*  Theoretically, that means that at some point those cases could be revived, but of course, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  the statutes of limitation may not survive until after the expiration of his presidency. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=444.48s)]
*  And then, of course, he still could pardon himself at the very expiration of his presidency. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=449.92s)]
*  So whether or not Donald Trump will ever be held accountable for the alleged crimes he committed [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=454.8s)]
*  during his first term and thereafter, that remains to be seen. But you can see an emboldened Trump [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=460.32s)]
*  approaching Trump 2.0, his second presidency, with a feeling that he is immune from criminal [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=466.56s)]
*  prosecution in a broad way. If he didn't have that feeling, I would surmise that he wouldn't [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=471.68s)]
*  have done some of the things that he and his administration did yesterday. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=477.36s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, our usual legal tour de force, thank you for joining us. Thank you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5cfOgsYmw&t=481.6s)]
