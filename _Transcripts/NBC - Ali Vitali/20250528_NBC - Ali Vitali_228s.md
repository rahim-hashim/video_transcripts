# Crypto kidnappings leave investors, executives on edge
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g)
*  Welcome back. A recent wave of abductions across Europe and the United States have put crypto executives, investors and their families on edge. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=0.0s)]
*  Victims have reported being pistol whipped, kidnapped and even tortured as criminals looked to the digital system's vulnerability to collect millions of dollars in cryptocurrency ransom. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=9.0s)]
*  Joining us now, the author of that new reporting, business reporter for Semaphore, Rohan Goswami. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=19.0s)]
*  Rohan, you're writing that these concerns have grown after attackers stole information from the largest crypto exchange. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=24.0s)]
*  That's Coinbase. So tell us what happened there and just how dire the consequences of that hack actually are. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, Ali, it depends on who you ask. Coinbase has described this attack as affecting a small subset of its eight million monthly transacting users. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=36.0s)]
*  Of course, that small subset, less than one percent, they say, is still a large number. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=46.0s)]
*  And those hackers obtained names, addresses and account balances. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=51.0s)]
*  In other words, everything that someone would theoretically need to carry out these kinds of targeted attacks that we've seen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=55.0s)]
*  Now, other outlets have also reported that federal regulators are probing this hack, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=61.0s)]
*  The latest in a spate of crypto related crime that has struck, even as this administration is increasingly embraced, crypto companies and cryptocurrencies as a part of America's financial system. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think there's the larger question here of why are criminals resorting to physical crime instead of something more online in this space? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=76.0s)]
*  Well, investors are smart and resistant to the kinds of phishing schemes that proliferated in this space in the early days. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=85.0s)]
*  If you think about a conventional bank account, it's actually really hard for any of us to take money out of that account. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=94.0s)]
*  We can only take around $10,000 of cash out of a standard checking account and banks can track anywhere that we send money to. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=99.0s)]
*  That's not the case with crypto, theoretically. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=106.0s)]
*  You can grab someone off the street, torture them as some alleged incidents have played out and end up obtaining their crypto wallets, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=109.0s)]
*  which can be a physical item that contains up to millions of dollars worth in cryptocurrency. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=118.0s)]
*  That's a lot easier, but also a lot harder because cryptocurrency's advantage here, as you saw in a case in France, is that because it's traceable and trackable, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=124.0s)]
*  theoretically the authorities or issuers of so-called stable coins can actually shut off the money that's sent as ransom or to these criminals. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=133.0s)]
*  And so what are crypto enthusiasts saying about this? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=142.0s)]
*  Is there any way for them to mitigate these potentially violent attacks? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=145.0s)]
*  Well, unsurprisingly, we've gotten quite used to corporate executives getting an increased level of security since the assassination of Brian Thompson last year. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=149.0s)]
*  Now, that's something that crypto executives have already started to do, but investors are now starting to do. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=158.0s)]
*  There was an emergency and highly secured meeting in France, a summit of sorts, with some of the most influential crypto investors in the country, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=163.0s)]
*  to discuss what the government could do to help protect those individuals. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=170.0s)]
*  Separately, however, some people in the US have taken this as an opportunity to actually call for a further rollback on crypto regulations. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=174.0s)]
*  They argue that the money laundering controls that stop terrorists, criminals, violent offenders of all sorts from using crypto to launder money [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=181.0s)]
*  are actually what are hurting executives, right, because you have to give your name and your address over to these crypto exchanges, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=189.0s)]
*  something which you have to do with banks anyways. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=195.0s)]
*  It's a really concerning trend. Rohan Goswami, we thank you for helping us break it down and understand it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=198.0s)]
*  And we'll, of course, be reading your latest reporting at Semaphore. Thank you, my friend. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=203.0s)]
*  Thanks, Ali. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=207.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_XIXs0M6g&t=228.0s)]
