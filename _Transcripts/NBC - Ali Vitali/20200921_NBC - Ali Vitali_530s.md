# Sen. Manchin Weighs In On Filling SCOTUS Seat | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os)
*  Welcome back to way too early. It is 530 here on the East Coast, 230 out west. I'm [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=0.0s)]
*  Casey Hunt. We begin this half hour with the contentious debate over the fate of the vacant [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=6.44s)]
*  seat on the Supreme Court. With just 43 days until election day, Senate Majority Leader [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=11.36s)]
*  Mitch McConnell has vowed to hold a Senate vote on a Trump nominee. Meanwhile, Democrats [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=16.66s)]
*  have warned Republicans to follow the precedent they set back in 2016 when they refused to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=22.92s)]
*  consider President Barack Obama's choice for the court on the grounds that it was an [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=29.04s)]
*  election year. In early 2016, McConnell said he would not give Merrick Garland his confirmation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=33.2s)]
*  proceedings because he argued voters should get to decide through the presidential election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=39.48s)]
*  It is also worth noting that the day after Justice Ginsburg's death, Senator Lindsey [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Graham, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted that he is quote, dead [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=50.42s)]
*  set on confirming whoever President Trump nominates for the seat. This comes despite [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=55.0s)]
*  the multiple times he said that if a vacancy opened up in the run up to a presidential [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=60.28s)]
*  election, he would hold off on confirmation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=65.76s)]
*  If there's a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=70.68s)]
*  first term, you can say Lindsey Graham said, let's let the next president, whoever it might [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=75.84s)]
*  be, make that nomination and you could use my words against me and you'd be absolutely [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=81.32s)]
*  right. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=85.96s)]
*  Now, I'll tell you this. This may make you feel better, but I really don't care. If an [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=86.96s)]
*  opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term and the primary process has started, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  we'll wait till the next election. And I've got a pretty good chance of being the judiciary. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=103.72s)]
*  You're on the record. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=108.56s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Hold the tape. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  So there it is. Over the weekend, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer held a conference call [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=113.92s)]
*  with congressional Democrats, starting with a moment of silence for the late Justice Ruth [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=119.4s)]
*  Bader Ginsburg. But he then proceeded to highlight the stakes in the aftermath of her passing, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  saying, quote, Our number one goal must be to communicate the stakes of the Supreme Court [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=129.16s)]
*  fight to the American people. Everything Americans value is at stake. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=134.68s)]
*  Health care, protections for preexisting conditions, women's rights, gay rights, workers' rights, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  labor rights, voting rights, civil rights, climate change, and so much else is at stake. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=145.32s)]
*  Let me be clear. If Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans move forward with this, then nothing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  is off the table for next year. Nothing is off the table. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=155.84s)]
*  struck a similar note. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=161.96s)]
*  Well, we have our options. We have arrows in our quiver that I'm not about to discuss [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  right now. But the fact is we have a big challenge in our country. This president has threatened [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=170.4s)]
*  to not even accept the results of the election with statements that he and his henchmen have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=177.6s)]
*  made. And joining me now, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Senator, thank [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=183.68s)]
*  you so much for getting up way too early to be with us today. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=191.4s)]
*  Well, it is way too early, Casey, but it's good to be with you on your beginning of your [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  show. And I think you're going to do a great job. I'm getting ready to go to D.C. So it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=200.4s)]
*  helped me get on the road a little bit a little bit sooner than expected. But thank you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=204.28s)]
*  Of course, thank you so much for being here. We're glad we could help you get your morning [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  started off right. Let's talk about the news, though, because we obviously did hear a little [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=212.84s)]
*  bit from Senator Chuck Schumer just there. And I know I'm starting to hear Democrats [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=217.64s)]
*  talk about health care. Yes, abortion is part of that conversation. And obviously there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  are a lot of pro-abortion rights supporters who are focused on that piece of it. But what [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  are Democrats going to do? What argument are you going to make to the American people about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=236.32s)]
*  this? Just this handful of days ahead of the election? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=240.92s)]
*  You know, I really think the argument is going to be truly about the American people holding [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=245.16s)]
*  people accountable for what they've said. My friend Lindsey Graham made a pretty bold [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=250.4s)]
*  statement back when he said he would hold himself accountable. You can hold him accountable. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  And you have to see if the people in South Carolina are going to hold him accountable [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=261.88s)]
*  and demand that he keep his word or basically the sincerity and if there is any integrity [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=265.84s)]
*  and when we say something, people want to believe public officials. I really believe [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=273.8s)]
*  that. And public officials should understand the importance and when they say something, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=277.72s)]
*  they should mean what they say and do what they say. So it's the people that will hold [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=282.08s)]
*  him. If the people like that doesn't matter, doesn't change anything, then I guess they'll [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=286.2s)]
*  go on and continue to say things that they don't intend to keep their word on. But we'll [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=289.92s)]
*  see what happens. I think this is in the hands of the American people. And in the swing states [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=295.12s)]
*  right now with all elections going on, every candidate that's running for reelection or [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=298.88s)]
*  every challenger is going to be able to put it forth to the voter to see how they feel [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  about this. And it's not going to be the pressure from D.C. It'll be the pressure from back [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=307.88s)]
*  home. And if people back home say, listen, you told me one thing, I you're doing something [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=311.68s)]
*  height of hypocrisy. I was just going to say, I mean, it seems very obvious when you watch [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=316.68s)]
*  the clips and Lindsey Graham was so straightforward and saying, hold me accountable for saying [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=323.12s)]
*  this. I think most people who watch that say this is completely hypocritical to do it [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=328.68s)]
*  this way. Now, I understand the precedent arguments that Mitch McConnell at all are [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=333.16s)]
*  making about the very specific reasons why this is different. But, I mean, do Republicans [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=337.64s)]
*  in your view, do they care that they seem so hypocritical? I mean, do they care at all? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  They seem full steam ahead regardless. You know, Casey, you know, you've known me a long [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=348.6s)]
*  time and you know me well enough to know that I'm as bipartisan as it can possibly be. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=353.36s)]
*  And I'm going to do everything I can to keep the Senate in the spirit of our founding [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=357.24s)]
*  fathers bipartisan. That means we have to reach out and work with each other, but also [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=361.44s)]
*  be direct and honest and sincere with each other. You know, there's not anything in the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=366.12s)]
*  rule book that has anything about decency and integrity and indignity that we should [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=370.04s)]
*  be able to conduct ourselves. And as we think about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she was all about [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=375.44s)]
*  that. I mean, we knew what she said. This is an icon. I've never seen and touched as [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=380.24s)]
*  much as she is my granddaughters, my daughters, all the women in my life that think that basically [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=385.64s)]
*  this trailblazer gave them a chance. Shouldn't we at least show the dignity of the family, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=392.32s)]
*  celebrate her life and let's take maybe take a week. We do that until we lay her to rest [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=398.32s)]
*  and her soul rest in peace. And then we move on because there's plenty of time for the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  political bickering back and forth. I think the public is tired of that, but let's see [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=408.24s)]
*  what happens. Senator, I'm speaking of the political back and forth. Chuck Schumer has [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=413.16s)]
*  said nothing is off the table if Republicans go through with pushing a Trump nominee through [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=419.04s)]
*  ahead of the election or in the event that Joe Biden were elected and they did it in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=423.92s)]
*  a lame duck session. That suggests that they would potentially add justices to the Supreme [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=428.36s)]
*  Court. Would you vote to add additional justices to the Supreme Court if Republicans move forward [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  with this and put Trump's nominee on the court? Casey, I'm going to do everything I can to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=441.71999999999997s)]
*  protect the institution. I'm sitting in the seat that Robert C. Byrd held for 50 years [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=446.8s)]
*  and there's no person that did more to prevent to protect the institution than Robert C. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  Byrd. He wrote the rules. So I have that to be considered and little to live up to. I'm [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=458.08s)]
*  going to do everything in my power. Whatever I vote on, whatever I support, whatever I [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  speak on, speak out on is going to be basically to save the integrity and save the bipartisanship. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=468.88s)]
*  Our founding fathers created the Senate and said we need the Senate like a saucer needs [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=477.64s)]
*  to cool off hot tea. Well, if we don't, we'll be just like the House. I mean, it's just, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=483.24s)]
*  majority plus one, Casey, and that's not PR. So I'm going to do anything. The decision [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=490.24s)]
*  I make will be to protect the institution and basically in a bipartisan way. I think [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=494.88s)]
*  we have to. We owe that to the people. I owe it to West Virginia. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=500.68s)]
*  All right. Senator Joe Manchin, that sounds a little bit like a no to me, but thank you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=503.68s)]
*  very much and thank you so much for getting up so early with us. It is great to have you [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=510.36s)]
*  on our very first show. So thank you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2ytbxF27Os&t=514.52s)]
