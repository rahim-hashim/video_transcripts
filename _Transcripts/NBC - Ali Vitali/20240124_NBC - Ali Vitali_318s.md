# Trump trails Biden in key battleground state in new polling
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E)
*  Welcome back. New 2024 general election polling out of Pennsylvania shows President Joe Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=0.0s)]
*  leading Donald Trump in that key battleground state. The recent Susquehanna polling and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  research show base shows the president up by eight points, increasing his margin over Trump [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=12.08s)]
*  since the firm's last survey back in September. The finding is consistent with a Quinnipiac poll [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=17.12s)]
*  of Pennsylvania voters from earlier this month that showed Biden improving his standing since [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  October. And for the Democratic candidate, Pennsylvania likely the most important state [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=27.12s)]
*  on the map. Hard to find a path to 270 without it. Joining us now, communication strategist [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=30.96s)]
*  and former aide to House speakers Ryan and Boehner, Brendan Buck. He is now an MSNBC [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=36.08s)]
*  political analyst. Brendan, good to see you. So let's talk about Trump and some of the warning [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=40.96s)]
*  signs that may also be emerging from his decisive victory last night. And let's be clear, he did [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=46.56s)]
*  win by 11 points. This poll in Pennsylvania gets to some of them, as well as his showing with [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=50.96s)]
*  independence last night in New Hampshire. Give us your analysis. Sure. I mean, well, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=55.52s)]
*  Donald Trump, excuse me, Pennsylvania, obviously something that Joe Biden has to win. As you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=59.92s)]
*  mentioned, there's no real way a Democrat is going to win without Pennsylvania. There are a lot of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  places, though, where Donald Trump is actually showing a lot of strength compared to just four [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=71.44s)]
*  years ago. My home state of Georgia, which was famously unkind to Donald Trump, is now showing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=75.76s)]
*  him consistently beating Joe Biden. So you can find spots where he's doing better and where he's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=81.68s)]
*  doing worse. What we're going to ultimately have here is a campaign where people are not really [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  excited about either candidate. And we had this in 2016 where people did not care for Hillary Clinton [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  or Donald Trump. And Trump did a better job of making her the unpleasant choice. Joe Biden is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  going to have to make Donald Trump to be unacceptable. There's a lot of people who [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=107.68s)]
*  don't like him, but there's a lot of people who are really unimpressed with Joe Biden's record as [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=111.2s)]
*  well. And the question is, who is going to make the other person the unacceptable choice, not just [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  the one that you don't care for? And I think that's ultimately what's going to decide what happens in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  November. And it does seem like the general election has begun, as we documented earlier, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  the Biden team shifting senior White House aides to Wilmington. They're focusing [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  squarely on Donald Trump now. Trump looking to take on Biden and ignore Nikki Haley. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=134.96s)]
*  Trump, again, it's an 11-point win last night. He earned around 50 percent in both Iowa and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  New Hampshire. Do you think there's a concern, though, that he didn't secure a larger share of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  the GOP electorate as he sort of bills himself almost as an incumbent? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=152.24s)]
*  Yeah, certainly this is not the showing you would want if you dominated the party in a way normal [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  candidate, a normal incumbent does. However, this is still very much Donald Trump's party, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  and I think Nikki Haley is finding that. New Hampshire was uniquely positioned for her [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=170.08s)]
*  to be able to have a good showing. And as we move on, there are very few states that are going to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=174.0s)]
*  behave in the way that New Hampshire did. There are a lot of Republicans who are ready to turn the page [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=178.8s)]
*  on Donald Trump. Whether they are willing to vote for Joe Biden is another question. And I think [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=184.56s)]
*  that's really what is going to be the most interesting thing about Nikki Haley's decision [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=190.24s)]
*  that she has in front of her. Is she willing to really run a campaign for the next month or two, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=194.48s)]
*  or however long it is, that undermines Donald Trump? She is going to be facing intense pressure [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=200.0s)]
*  within the party to drop out, allow the party to coalesce. Joe Biden is already using her against [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=205.6s)]
*  Donald Trump. Is she willing to risk her standing in the party, risk whatever future she may have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  in the party to really undermine him and tell a lot of those skeptical Republican voters that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=218.56s)]
*  Donald Trump is just not worth it? And I think that could really have an impact in November in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=223.84s)]
*  the same way that we talk about a lot of these third parties. And Brandon, let's stay on that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  very topic for a moment more. Haley pulled a lot of her punches throughout the campaign, hit Trump [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=232.0s)]
*  harder in recent days up there in New Hampshire. As you talk to Republicans and just your own sense [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=237.04s)]
*  of it, what do you think she is going to do? Is she going to stay in this or bow out? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=241.84s)]
*  I would be surprised if she stuck out through South Carolina. One, because, as I said, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=247.36s)]
*  the upside or the downside risk is pretty immense. And I think she's going to start feeling the walls [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=254.24s)]
*  closing in on her pretty quickly when she realizes there's no real path. But, you know, at the same [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=258.72s)]
*  time, there may be money that could keep her floating out there. She may not care about her [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=264.72s)]
*  future in the party. She may not realize that she has a future in the party. She may think this is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  more important than any future. And that would, frankly, be surprising because she has not run [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=274.08s)]
*  a campaign that would indicate that to this point. As you were discussing with Eugene, I absolutely [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  believe that she ran a campaign just hoping that she would be there to pick up the pieces if you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=282.32s)]
*  fell apart. It's very little too late at this point. Yeah, she's running until she's not. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=286.08s)]
*  We'll see if that changes. MSNBC political analyst Brendan Buck, thank you so very much [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=291.12s)]
*  for joining us this morning. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvQ-1NL57E&t=296.24s)]
