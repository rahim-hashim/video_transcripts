# Trump's White House return: Testing checks and balances
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE)
*  It's been just over a week since Donald Trump returned to the White House, and in that time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=0.0s)]
*  he's signed dozens of executive orders targeting everything from immigration, the military, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  climate change, federal diversity programs, and much, much more. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=9.76s)]
*  As his new administration gets underway, some legal experts argue Trump's earliest days [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=14.16s)]
*  are showing how he'll test the limits of power, but also checks and balances themselves. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=18.1s)]
*  Joining us now, New York Times bestselling author and award-winning podcast host, Sami [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=24.7s)]
*  Sage. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=28.42s)]
*  Sami, thanks for joining us way early in the morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=29.42s)]
*  First, I just want to start with this general idea of the shock and awe campaign that we've [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=31.44s)]
*  seen the Trump administration go on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=35.84s)]
*  To me, it feels like it's the point. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  What are you looking at? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=40.28s)]
*  That's 100 percent the point. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=41.28s)]
*  You know, I think about how at the DNC, State Senator Mallory MacMorrow from Michigan had [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=43.06s)]
*  this giant set piece, this prop of a Project 2025 book to demonstrate how extensive the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  Republicans' plans were. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  I feel like they just dropped that book on the American people in one week. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=55.34s)]
*  That was really the point. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=59.52s)]
*  After saying that's not really our plan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=60.52s)]
*  Right, of course. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=61.52s)]
*  I think part of the problem is that the Democrats were not able to convince the American people [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=63.24s)]
*  that this was the plan and that they were going to do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=66.72s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=69.98s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=70.98s)]
*  I think messaging is such a central piece because I was reading a piece in New York [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=71.98s)]
*  Magazine the other day. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  I'll pull up a piece of it on the screen so we can talk about it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=76.2s)]
*  The author says this set, and she's talking about young conservatives right now who flooded [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Washington for the inauguration. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=83.54s)]
*  She says their most visible political stance is a reaction to what they see as the left's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=85.3s)]
*  puritanical obsessions with policing language and talking about identity. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=89.58s)]
*  To me, that's been a central point to being a capital D Democrat, and the party is now [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=94.74s)]
*  trying to pull that apart. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=100.22s)]
*  What do you see in this? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=102.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think that we're seeing an extreme overreaction to the way that people have seen [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=103.06s)]
*  the Democrats as being obsessed with DEI and obsessed with identity politics. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=108.82s)]
*  In this article, this New York Magazine article that I thought was really fascinating and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=113.74s)]
*  really telling, they talk about how so many of the people who were in DC for the inauguration [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  were sort of bound by this desire to be unfettered in what they're saying. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=122.06s)]
*  There are people who are saying, now I can say the F word, the slur, and the R word. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=127.58s)]
*  It reminded me of a similar article in the Financial Times from about a week ago where [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=134.06s)]
*  there was an investment banker who was saying that at work, he says this anonymously, it's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=137.9s)]
*  a new day because he can say the F word and the R word at work now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  What I really think of this is, is that that important to you? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  The only word I can come up with is vice signaling because it's the opposite reaction to what [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=150.14s)]
*  Democrats were doing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  It's exactly, and it's this really reactive way of showing who they are. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  Why is that the thing that's overcoming politics and policy? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  I know that MAGAism is cultural at this point, but for Democrats who are trying to chart [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=170.34s)]
*  the path back and they've got the DNC elections this week, even yesterday, Governor Whitmer [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=175.54s)]
*  wouldn't name one specific name of who's leading the party, just saying they've got a lot of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=180.22s)]
*  leaders. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=184.18s)]
*  That's your answer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=185.18s)]
*  But is that viable? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=186.18s)]
*  No, but it is how it is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=188.18s)]
*  That is the landscape right now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=192.06s)]
*  For better or worse, there isn't really someone who's been able to take that mantle. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=193.94s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=198.5s)]
*  I think the reason that people see this about culture and the Democrats are in a deep cultural [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=199.5s)]
*  value right now, and I don't see them finding their way out because that does not seem to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=203.26s)]
*  be their desire, their desired path. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=207.74s)]
*  But part of it, I think, is the information environment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=211.46s)]
*  If there's really only a few silos in which you can get your information and everyone, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=214.06s)]
*  you know, if everything that's being fed to you is angry about identity politics and all [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=219.7s)]
*  of these things, then that's what people are going to obsess about. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=224.46s)]
*  Well, there were key Trump advisors after the election who were saying to the keyboard [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=226.62s)]
*  warriors, in their words, that they were the reason that they were able to sustain and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=231.22s)]
*  continue the MAGA movement. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=235.86s)]
*  It's a central piece. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=237.82s)]
*  So you've got, we've talked about this, the technology oligarchs that Biden called out [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=238.82s)]
*  at the end of his term, the Musks, the Zuckerbergs, and then, of course, the warriors themselves [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=243.5s)]
*  behind the screens and behind their keyboards. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  The Democrats don't feel like they have that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=250.86s)]
*  Do you want to know why? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=253.5s)]
*  Because they do not, because the leaders of the Democratic Party, for lack of a better [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=254.78s)]
*  word, have been unable to connect with the emotion of the American people. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=259.86s)]
*  And people just do not believe them. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=265.86s)]
*  They don't believe them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=269.1s)]
*  They feel that the party has been captured by moneyed interests just as much as the Republican [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=270.1s)]
*  Party. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=273.66s)]
*  Whether or not that is true is, you know, that depends where you sit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=274.66s)]
*  I would say that that is not true. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=279.14s)]
*  That is the perception amongst the average voter. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  And I think that that is the life of the average voter. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  It has been reflected to them that the Democrats were not really looking out for them either. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=288.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=292.7s)]
*  And when you were at the DNC, as I've been on the campaign trail, this is the thing that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  we hear from voters all the time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  The message is just for some reason not connecting. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=297.32s)]
*  Sammy Sage, thank you, as always, for joining us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=300.26s)]
*  Thanks, Ali. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8w7JQZYMyE&t=302.46000000000004s)]
