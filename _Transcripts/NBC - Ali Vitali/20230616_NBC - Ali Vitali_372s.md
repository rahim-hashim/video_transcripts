# Biden, Iowa, New Hampshire signal primary fight
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs)
*  Welcome back. With more than six months still until the first primary votes are cast in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=0.0s)]
*  the 2024 election cycle, Axios is reporting that already President Joe Biden is in jeopardy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=6.16s)]
*  of losing two of them, but it's not perhaps what you think. Biden has been pushing for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=13.32s)]
*  Democrats to host the first primary in South Carolina. That state, of course, helped him [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=17.62s)]
*  secure the Democratic nomination back in 2020. But the proposal has rankled establishment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=23.26s)]
*  Democrats in New Hampshire and Iowa. Now, those two states, of course, were the first [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=28.98s)]
*  primary votes of the season are usually cast. According to Axios, Iowa and New Hampshire [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=34.2s)]
*  could just hold a primary vote and leave Biden off the ballot, allowing another long shot [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  candidate to win the primaries there. The DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee is slated [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=45.54s)]
*  to review Iowa's primary plan today. Joining us now, the author of that report, national [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=50.94s)]
*  political correspondent for Axios, Alex Thompson. Alex, great to see you. We've known for a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=56.82s)]
*  while now that New Hampshire pretty unhappy with the president's plan to have that first [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=62.54s)]
*  primary in South Carolina. The state senators have made their displeasure known. But Iowa [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=66.7s)]
*  sort of caught me by surprise seeing this report because there hadn't been much talk [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=71.98s)]
*  about Iowa. So where do things stand and are there any talks that could change this? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=75.38s)]
*  Well, there are really no talks that could probably change the current trajectory unless [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=81.1s)]
*  there is some significant shift. Now, Iowa hasn't been as loud as New Hampshire has been, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=85.78s)]
*  but quietly they've basically said, we're probably going to hold our caucuses the same [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  day. Now you said they're going to review the same day as the Republicans, which will be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=94.66s)]
*  before New Hampshire. Now you mentioned the DNC is set to review the plan today. Now I can [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  tell you pretty confidently that they are not going to approve the current plan because the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=103.7s)]
*  current plan has them ahead of South Carolina. So essentially Iowa has submitted a plan that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=107.42s)]
*  they know will almost certainly not be approved. So what that does is it kicks the can down the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=112.34s)]
*  road. They're going to review it in another two months. I anticipate they're also going to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=116.9s)]
*  submit a plan that the DNC is not going to approve. And so DNC is going to strip them of their [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=120.26s)]
*  delegates, right? They're out of compliance to the rules, which is also why Joe Biden is probably [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  not going to be on the ballot because Joe Biden says, I'm going to abide by the DNC rules. But [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  what this ends up, the scenario is that you could have someone like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or some [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=134.86s)]
*  other long shot Democratic primary candidate win those first two contests. And then you have a few [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=139.78s)]
*  weeks of like sort of weird coverage before South Carolina, where we should note Joe Biden is almost [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=145.7s)]
*  certainly going to win. He is almost certainly going to be the nominee, but it might be an [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  unwelcome few new cycles for him. So is there litigation that could come out of this? Like [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=154.18s)]
*  the states and the DNC going to file lawsuits back and forth? And to be clear, no one's suggesting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  that President Biden's grip on the nomination is in jeopardy. But you're right. It could be awkward. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=164.98s)]
*  It could give life to you can see Republicans certainly taking these headlines and really trying [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  to create trouble with them. Well, the problem is that in terms of litigation, there's probably not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=173.54s)]
*  going to be they're both in a staring match really at each other at this point. The DNC, we just [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  prefer this problem to go away. And also part of the problem is that New Hampshire has a state law [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=183.22s)]
*  with a Republican governor that requires the New Hampshire primary to go first. So Democrats, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=187.94s)]
*  it's in their self-interest, but they're basically throwing their hands up and says [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  there's a state law and there's a Republican governor that is not going to change it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=196.5s)]
*  You also have the same problem in Iowa with their own Republican governor who just signed a law two [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=200.82s)]
*  weeks ago that is now requiring an in-person caucus on the exact same day as the Republican caucus. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=205.77999999999997s)]
*  So let's talk 2024. You mentioned Robert F. Kennedy Jr. We're not going to spend much more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=212.66s)]
*  time on him right now, but it is noteworthy, I guess, in a couple of polls show him at 15, 20 percent, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=217.38s)]
*  which maybe some analysts think is just a representation of Democrats looking for other [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=222.74s)]
*  options. Like it's not going to be Robert F. Kennedy Jr. per se, but they have some concerns [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=226.74s)]
*  about President Biden. How would you, national party leaders you speak to, like how do they feel [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=230.82s)]
*  about the place that he's in right now for his reelection bid where so much energy is spent on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=235.14s)]
*  the Republicans, rightly at this moment because their field is up and going and yelling at each [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=239.3s)]
*  other. The president is kind of his campaign deliberately, low key start, raising some money, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=243.06s)]
*  no official events yet, barely any staff. But do they feel like he's in a pretty good place or [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=248.02s)]
*  they have some concerns? They definitely have concerns. I mean, mostly it is all oriented [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=252.74s)]
*  around one word, age, or 80, one number, because they, you know, President Biden had that fall [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=257.54s)]
*  like the other week over the sandbag. And obviously, a lot of Democratic leaders I talk to, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=264.5s)]
*  they constantly go back and refer to actually the 1996 campaign, which you may remember, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=270.66s)]
*  Bob Dole had this terrible fall near the very end that he was probably going to lose anyway. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=275.62s)]
*  But you have a lot of Democratic leaders that have that event seared into their memory. And I think [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=279.7s)]
*  the one thing that they constantly talk about is like, we just don't want to have another fall. We [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=284.58s)]
*  don't have another trip. And that includes people inside the administration too, that just sort of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=288.42s)]
*  cringe every time he is sort of shuffling along there. That being said, they think he has a very [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=292.74s)]
*  strong record to run on. They also think that with the Republicans running further, further to the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=297.14s)]
*  right on issues like abortion rights, you have DeSantis hitting Trump on a six-week abortion ban. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=302.34s)]
*  And there's a reason why Joe Biden is going to be talking about gun rights. This is a gun, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=307.7s)]
*  not gun rights, but gun control, gun safety. This is not technically a campaign event, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=313.7s)]
*  but it really is. And Harris talking in North Carolina next week on the anniversary of the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=317.94s)]
*  repeal of Roe v. Wade, that's not a mistake either. That's also technically a campaign event. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=324.02s)]
*  That's not a campaign event. Yeah, you're certainly right about the fears of another fall. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  Imagine as one aide put to me recently, what if he had fallen and broken something and spent [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=332.02s)]
*  a couple of weeks in a cast or worse? But you're right. They also look across the aisle and see [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=335.85999999999996s)]
*  the Republicans self-immolating, including the leading candidate just having been in federal [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=340.58s)]
*  arraignment. So they feel pretty good about that. National political correspondent for [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  Access, Alex Thompson. Great to see you as always. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cmNb0QmhZs&t=348.66s)]
