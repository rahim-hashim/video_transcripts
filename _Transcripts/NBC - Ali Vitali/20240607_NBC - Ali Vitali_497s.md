# Trump floats arresting political opponents
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump has left the door open to jailing his political opponents [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=2.2s)]
*  should he be elected to a second term. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=6.42s)]
*  Speaking to a local Arizona station, Trump also aired his frustrations over his own conviction. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  The world is different now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=13.92s)]
*  They're doing things that were never done. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=16.68s)]
*  They're doing what they do in third world countries. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=18.44s)]
*  With my thing, I had no crime. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=21.6s)]
*  There was no crime. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=22.88s)]
*  There was no anything. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=23.88s)]
*  The prosecutor never wanted to bring the case until I decided to run. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=25.12s)]
*  The only reason they brought the case is because I ran for election. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=28.32s)]
*  It could have been brought seven years ago. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=31.32s)]
*  There would have been nothing to say, but nobody wanted to bring it because there is [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=32.76s)]
*  no case. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=36.16s)]
*  There was no crime. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=37.16s)]
*  So when you ask me the question, would we do it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=38.76s)]
*  I'll talk to you in about three years from now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=40.84s)]
*  Joining us now, special correspondent at Vanity Fair and host of the Fast Politics podcast, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=43.96s)]
*  our friend Molly Jung Fast. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=49.08s)]
*  She is an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=50.24s)]
*  So Molly, I mean, this is since Trump's Trump has long threatened to use the power of government [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  to go after his political opponents. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=58.28s)]
*  He did so while he was in office. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  But since his guilty verdict, that rhetoric has only increased and he has singled out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  political opponents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=67.56s)]
*  He singled out people in the media he doesn't like. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=68.56s)]
*  How seriously should we all take this? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=72.8s)]
*  I mean, I think you should take everything Donald Trump says seriously, literally, technically, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=75.04s)]
*  all the ways, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=81.12s)]
*  Because we saw in the first administration that he did try, in fact. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=82.48s)]
*  He pushed, he bullied his his admin to try to go after Hillary Clinton. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=87.16s)]
*  So I mean, they couldn't find anything. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=91.84s)]
*  And look, we even saw the Republicans in the House. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=94.44s)]
*  He encouraged them to impeach Joe Biden. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=97.4s)]
*  And while that impeachment fell apart when their star witness ended up in jail, they [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=100.08s)]
*  tried and they would have kept going. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Could they have like really put together a case? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=106.96s)]
*  So I think yes, for sure, Trump is vengeance. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=108.92s)]
*  But then Trump is very involved in vengeance. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=111.92s)]
*  I think what is important to remember is that Will Hurd said it best when he was running. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  Will Hurd said Donald Trump is running for president to stay out of prison. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=119.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=122.8s)]
*  Now, I think that's undeniably part of what he's what he's doing here. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=123.8s)]
*  And I think you and I have talked several times about the need to focus on the stakes [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=128.12s)]
*  of the election and not just the day to day developments. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=131.28s)]
*  This is one of those moments where this is extremely important. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=133.56s)]
*  Let's hit a bunch of other topics here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=136.6s)]
*  You know, speaking of some Biden campaign aides yesterday who flagged these comments [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=138.92s)]
*  and saying, look, this is the president, former president of the United States and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=143.48s)]
*  current presidential nominee attacking the rule of law. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  These are foundations of our democracy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=149.76s)]
*  Split screen that with President Biden, who's overseas talking about the need to protect [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  democracy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=156.16s)]
*  These sort of arguments, these sort of lofty themes, they resonate with voters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=157.16s)]
*  So remember before the midterms when Biden gave those two speeches about democracy and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=160.76s)]
*  and we in the pundit class were like people don't vote on democracy, people vote on prices, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  but people did actually like those speeches and they did resonate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=171.48s)]
*  So look, I mean, midterm voters and 2024, you know, we don't know who's going to show [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=175.2s)]
*  up at this election. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=180.6s)]
*  And that's part of the problem with the polls is it's just impossible to know if those low [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=181.76s)]
*  frequency voters come back for Trump or not. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=185.76s)]
*  But the engaged high frequency voters, the people who are Biden's base love this, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=188.92s)]
*  As well, they should look. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=195.44s)]
*  I mean, this is really we're in uncharted territory here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, and Trump is unabashedly running as an autocrat. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=200.8s)]
*  So there this sort of he has Biden is set up to make this argument. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=204.96s)]
*  And I think it's morally necessary that he makes this argument. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=210.16s)]
*  And I think it's important for the stakes of democracy that he makes this argument. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=213.36s)]
*  And I think also politically, it works for him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm deeply important. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=219.84s)]
*  Let's just set that first and foremost. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  But also on the politics, you raise the idea of who votes on this idea of democracy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, the Biden theory, the cases, issues of democracy and also decorum. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  You know who votes on that? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=233.44s)]
*  Older Americans and older Americans show up to vote. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  So there seems to be a sense among Biden world who polling suggests they're doing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  surprisingly well with older Americans, that if they do enough there, that might [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=241.88s)]
*  offset some losses they're seeing right now among younger Americans. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=247.27999999999997s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, they OK, so I think that's totally certainly a strong point there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=250.88s)]
*  And the older Americans who used to vote Republican feel like they're they like to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=256.48s)]
*  they like normal. I mean, most people like normal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=261.08s)]
*  And one of the problems I think Trump world is going to have, which they have had [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=263.52s)]
*  historically, is Trump has no interest in growing the electorate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=267.04s)]
*  And he never has. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=270.24s)]
*  You know, he's never given a speech that was like, you know, you didn't vote for me, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=271.4s)]
*  but I'm not going to rage fury on you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=274.8s)]
*  I'm just going to govern for you the way. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=277.32s)]
*  And that's what normal presidents did. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=279.92s)]
*  And they did it for a reason because they wanted to get reelected. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=281.44s)]
*  So Trump has taken this other tact. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=284.8s)]
*  And, you know, the base needs more and more to get excited. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  So he is sort of painting himself into a corner here where he does that retribution [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=290.44s)]
*  stuff because partially because maybe he believes it, though, who knows, but [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=294.64s)]
*  partially because the base loves it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=298.96s)]
*  Right. So we are now just a little over a week since the guilty verdict. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=300.92s)]
*  We've seen some polls that show modest, but still movement, a point or two towards [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  President Biden in a race that's going to be, we think, extremely close. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=310.6s)]
*  That could matter. What's your analysis of what you've seen so far? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=314.76s)]
*  So I think what's really interesting about the polls, again, because you and I, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=317.72s)]
*  we both take polls with a grain of salt. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=321.76s)]
*  And there's but, you know, you want to look at movement. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  But I also think what's interesting is all of these polls that show that people [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  think the verdict was rightly decided. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=329.0s)]
*  I mean, that, I think, is really interesting because there really is still a solid [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  faith in the rule of law, which is good news for American democracy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=336.68s)]
*  Right. Because people are seeing this as what it is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=341.08s)]
*  And they see these are 12 jurors. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=343.8s)]
*  You know, these jurors made this decision. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=345.8s)]
*  Trump's guy had, you know, Trump's lawyer had a chance to get rid of the jurors. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  He didn't want to keep on the jury. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=352.36s)]
*  You know, there really was the way it works. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=353.72s)]
*  And so I do think ultimately, this polling on how it's received, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=356.12s)]
*  it might be even more important. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=361.68s)]
*  But I also think that more transparency and having cameras in the courtroom [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  might have actually helped more. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=368.8s)]
*  Like, the more people can see these criminal cases, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  the more they can see how they work. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=373.28s)]
*  I think that's really important. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=375.24s)]
*  Also, I think this Hunter Biden case, even though, you know, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=376.44s)]
*  the idea that they're charging him because he said he was an addict and a text message. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=379.68s)]
*  I mean, that stuff is pretty convoluted. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=384.96s)]
*  But, you know, it does make the case that the law is the law for everyone. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  And they really are. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=390.68s)]
*  I mean, these charges are pretty unusual and they're doing it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=391.76s)]
*  So there really is a sign that they're just going after everyone, left, right, center. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, a follow up on the Hunter Biden case. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=399.8s)]
*  I mean, you're right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=401.2s)]
*  Then you make a good point here that the president did not interfere with this investigation. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=401.8s)]
*  In fact, he said yesterday in an interview, he would not pardon his son, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=405.64s)]
*  even if Hunter were to be convicted. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=409.32s)]
*  So I think those are good things in his column. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=411.08s)]
*  Do you think there would be any any downside here for President Biden, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=413.4s)]
*  or Hunter to be convicted? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=417.84s)]
*  Of course, as the personal toll, of course. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think there's any political impact? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=421.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think, look, you know, there are low information voters who are like, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=422.56s)]
*  oh, they're both in trouble with the law. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=426.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I would say Hunter Biden is very different than Donald Trump. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=428.56s)]
*  And being a crack addict because you have an addiction is very different than a myriad of criminal charges. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  There's many cases which you've been able to punt and then you have these fraud cases. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=440.12s)]
*  So I don't think they're the same at all. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  But I do think, you know, everything can be a problem, especially in politics. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=445.76s)]
*  And certainly those close to President Biden worry just about how he will receive this news. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=450.4s)]
*  We know how he's deeply worried about his son. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=455.36s)]
*  And also the first lady coming back from France to go to the trial. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=458.08s)]
*  I mean, there really hasn't. The sisters been. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=461.68s)]
*  I mean, everyone in Biden world, they're really a close family. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=463.44s)]
*  And I think that speaks well of them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=466.52s)]
*  But I think it's a huge stressor. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  And a lot of Americans can relate to the trouble with addiction. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=470.0s)]
*  MSNBC political analyst Molly John-Lefast, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hapwEJvbn5c&t=473.2s)]
