# Biden leads Trump in latest 2024 general election polling
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4)
*  With the race for the White House and exactly one week before President Joe Biden and Donald Trump meet on the debate stage, we've got new polling that shows that the sitting president has moved into the lead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=0.0s)]
*  For the first time since October, the latest Fox News survey finds Biden ahead of Trump 50% to 48% among registered voters. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=12.84s)]
*  Now, to be clear, that two point difference is within the polls margin of error. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=22.279999999999998s)]
*  But this new survey marks a three point swing towards Biden from last month and a seven point swing from March. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=27.56s)]
*  That number matters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=35.92s)]
*  The change is being driven in large part by independents who now say they backed Biden by nine points after Trump held a two point lead with the group a month ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=37.76s)]
*  As for the issues motivating voters, 68% say the future of democracy is extremely important in deciding who they vote for. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=48.32s)]
*  That's two points ahead of the economy, which ranks second. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=57.0s)]
*  A separate new poll, this one from NPR, PBS News and Marist College, also shows President Biden flipping the script with independent voters. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=61.84s)]
*  In this survey, Biden leads Trump by two points of independence, 50 to 48, after he trailed by 12 points just last month. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=71.0s)]
*  Despite that big shift, the poll finds the two candidates tied in the overall race at 49% each, which is essentially the same as a month ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=79.6s)]
*  That's because, although Biden has made inroads with independents, Trump has expanded his own lead with white voters. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZ6ZlhqiI4&t=89.16s)]
