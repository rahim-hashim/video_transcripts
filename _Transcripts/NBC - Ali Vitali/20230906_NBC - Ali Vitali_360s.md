# Vietnam veteran receives Medal of Honor
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw)
*  He refused to give up, refused to leave a fellow American behind, refused to put his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=0.0s)]
*  own life above the lives of others in need. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=7.38s)]
*  When duty called, Larry did everything, did everything to answer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=11.06s)]
*  Because of that, he rewrote the fate of four families for generations to come. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=17.42s)]
*  That's valor. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=24.8s)]
*  That's valor. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=26.5s)]
*  It's our nation at its very best. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=28.26s)]
*  And that's why it's now my great honor to ask Lieutenant Colonel Anne Hughes to read [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  your Medal of Honor citation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=35.7s)]
*  That was President Joe Biden yesterday presenting the Medal of Honor to a veteran of the Vietnam [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=41.22s)]
*  War. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Eighty-one-year-old Army Captain Larry Taylor was honored for his heroic actions back in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  1968. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=52.1s)]
*  Then a first Lieutenant Army pilot, Taylor risked his life to extract surrounded comrades [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=53.74s)]
*  via helicopter. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=59.5s)]
*  A moving, moving ceremony. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=60.5s)]
*  Of course, America faced deep divisions during the Vietnam era. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=62.54s)]
*  Today, the United States is also working through a new set of pressures, stemming from the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=66.3s)]
*  rise in partisan politics and internal threats to democracy itself. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=71.9s)]
*  Joining us now to talk about that is the author and NBC News presidential historian Michael [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  Beschloss. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=82.34s)]
*  Michael, so good to see you this morning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=83.34s)]
*  Same here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=85.94s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=87.42s)]
*  We so often are consumed, rightly, with the day-to-day of our politics. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=89.02s)]
*  But let's take a step back and put this era, this remarkable and frankly divided partisan [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=94.74s)]
*  at times, very ugly era, put that into perspective for us on the American landscape. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=100.34s)]
*  Well, look at what happened yesterday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=104.86s)]
*  And sometimes we need reminders, many of us, that huge numbers of Americans over centuries [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=108.18s)]
*  have risked and given their lives on battlefields and also domestically in the civil rights [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=116.78s)]
*  movement protesting other infringements on our rights to save this democracy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=122.98s)]
*  This didn't come for free. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=129.38s)]
*  And we had some very close calls. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=131.28s)]
*  Revolutionary war, War of 1812. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=134.26000000000002s)]
*  Civil War and also World War II, just to name a few. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=137.54000000000002s)]
*  So if you remember all that history, we have to remember how precious our voting rights [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=141.66000000000003s)]
*  are and our democracy is and our system. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  And any effort to even slightly infringe on those rights, such as we saw on the 6th of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=150.5s)]
*  January 2021, we should be outraged. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=156.34s)]
*  But it's clear that a large portion of the country simply isn't, because we've got new [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=161.74s)]
*  polling just out in the last day or so that shows that the Republican Party continues [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=166.18s)]
*  to support someone accused of trying to overthrow this nation's very democracy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=170.3s)]
*  You're someone, of course, has studied many presidential scandals of the past. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=175.1s)]
*  What does it tell you right now about the state of the country that so much of the GOP [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=179.94s)]
*  is still completely in the thrall of Donald J. Trump? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=183.82s)]
*  Well, they are a cult at the moment. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=187.38s)]
*  They are in denial. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=189.9s)]
*  And I think this is the way I would look at it, Jonathan. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=191.4s)]
*  I usually don't look at things through rose-colored glasses, but I think two centuries of American [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=193.98s)]
*  history give us this optimism. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=199.3s)]
*  You know, you use the word accused. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  Yes, Donald Trump and the co-conspirators have been accused of doing those things. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=203.78s)]
*  But on the big issues, those trials have not been held. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=208.7s)]
*  Let's say that the trials are held before voters choose in a presidential election a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=212.06s)]
*  year from this November. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=217.14s)]
*  What will Donald Trump be accused of and possibly convicted, or at least big evidence [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=219.22s)]
*  shown that he may have been guilty of? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=224.1s)]
*  In Georgia, stealing the voting rights of American citizens that were so hard won. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=226.66s)]
*  You know, even the civil rights movement of the 1960s did so much to open up voting in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=232.82s)]
*  Georgia, other areas of the United States. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=238.14s)]
*  And then in a federal trial showed that on January 6th, he may have been the leader of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=241.44s)]
*  a conspiracy to take away our democracy, to stop what Congress was doing, to stop the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=247.85999999999999s)]
*  orderly transfer of power. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=254.1s)]
*  We could have lost our democracy and maybe even physically some of our leaders that day [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=255.94s)]
*  if this plan, presumably led by Donald Trump, had succeeded. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  So I prefer to think that over two centuries of American history show that Americans have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=265.7s)]
*  wisdom once they get the facts. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=271.3s)]
*  And I think a year from now, Americans will be reacting very differently. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=273.74s)]
*  So Michael, lastly, and briefly, you use the word cult to describe Trump and his followers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=279.14s)]
*  Certainly there is a fever right now in this nation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  What is your sense as to when that fever will break? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=288.22s)]
*  Could it be next year? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=290.42s)]
*  Were Trump to be convicted? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=291.62s)]
*  Were he to lose the election again? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=292.62s)]
*  Or is this going to fever stay with us even beyond Donald Trump himself? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=294.38s)]
*  I think the Trump fever, if you and I are defining this as devotion to one person, no [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=299.02000000000004s)]
*  matter what criminal offenses it is proven in court that he has done, that's a cult. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=304.26s)]
*  At the same time, if Donald Trump, let's say, were to pull out or be defeated next year, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  you've still got a Republican Party, which compared to 10 years ago is much more radical, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=317.26s)]
*  much more prone to conspiracy theories, much more angry. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=323.5s)]
*  Those things will not go away. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=327.46s)]
*  An important conversation, one we will keep having in the weeks and months ahead. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=329.82s)]
*  Author and NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss, thank you as always, my [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=334.38s)]
*  friend. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  Thanks, Jonathan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Zw1tfWhpw&t=339.29999999999995s)]
