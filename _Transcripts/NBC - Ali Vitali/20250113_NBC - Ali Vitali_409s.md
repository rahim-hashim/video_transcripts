# Pete Hegseth set to face senators at confirmation hearing Tuesday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg)
*  Pete Hegseth, whose president-elect Trump's pick to head the Department of Defense, will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=0.0s)]
*  face senators at a confirmation hearing tomorrow, kicking off a week of action on confirmations [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=3.9s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=8.74s)]
*  Senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the two head lawmakers [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=10.32s)]
*  on the Senate Armed Services Committee, received Hegseth's FBI background check on Friday, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=14.6s)]
*  two sources tell NBC News. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=19.12s)]
*  The 25-member committee does not necessarily need to review Hegseth's background check [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=20.92s)]
*  to proceed with the nomination hearing, but two committee sources familiar with the process [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=24.94s)]
*  said it was unprecedented that the report took this long to get to the panel's members. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=29.08s)]
*  Democrats on the panel have been frustrated by the delay and suggest the report may not [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=34.32s)]
*  be thorough, but they say they'd prefer to see it before Hegseth's hearing tomorrow, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=37.8s)]
*  regardless. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=41.92s)]
*  A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=42.92s)]
*  Hegseth, a veteran and former Fox News host, has faced multiple controversies and allegations [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  since he was announced as Trump's defense secretary pick. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=50.56s)]
*  He's met with multiple Republican members of the committee, but his team has told most [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=53.6s)]
*  Democratic senators that he would only be available to meet with them after the hearing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=57.92s)]
*  Joining us now is senior investigative producer and story editor for NBC News, Sarah Fitzpatrick. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=62.72s)]
*  Sarah, let's dig into your latest story because it lays out a lot about, A, what's typical [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  to the background check process, and B, why Democratic senators are frustrated about this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  So take them in order. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=77.2s)]
*  What is actually the norm for this? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  So typically the transition team, the presidential transition team, can ask the FBI to conduct [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=81.04s)]
*  a background check. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=86.58s)]
*  And it sounds exactly kind of like what we do here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=88.14s)]
*  You go back and discuss, look through people's finances, talk to their spouses. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=90.7s)]
*  It's kind of a wide range and typically is a very exhaustive process. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=96.38s)]
*  But the key point here is that the client, the person who orders this background check, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=100.7s)]
*  it's the transition team. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=104.62s)]
*  It is not Congress. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=106.02s)]
*  So they can lay out what they, what the parameters are in terms of which witnesses they can speak [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=107.5s)]
*  to, how thorough they want it to be. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=113.34s)]
*  And I think that's where we're going to see some really potentially explosive conversations [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=115.74s)]
*  on Capitol Hill because our indications from our reporting is that this background check [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  has not contacted everyone that we would typically expect the FBI to contact. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=124.38s)]
*  Yeah, you've been doing a lot of reporting in this space, both on the allegations of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=129.1s)]
*  misuse of funds when Hegseth was at various veterans organizations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=132.48s)]
*  There are people who have said to you, haven't heard from the FBI. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=136.7s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=139.38s)]
*  In fact, as of this morning, people who worked closely with Pete Hegseth or have been contacted [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=140.38s)]
*  by Congress about Pete Hegseth's behavior, they have not heard from the FBI. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=145.26s)]
*  And so it's an indication that, you know, even the very surface level of this has not, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  those conversations have not taken place. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=156.62s)]
*  And those are people with really critical and important information about this nominee. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  There have also been not just Republican, not just Democratic senators who say, I want [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=162.62s)]
*  to see the background checks, but Republican senators as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=166.26s)]
*  Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, they've all said to me in the halls, I want to see this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=169.38s)]
*  before I make any decisions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=172.78s)]
*  How abnormal or normal is it for wide ranging members of the committee, not just the chairman [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=174.7s)]
*  and the ranking member to not have seen these background checks? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=180.14s)]
*  It is unprecedented. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=183.5s)]
*  Generally, you would share. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=184.82s)]
*  It's kind of a standard process. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  You would be briefed on what's in there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=188.38s)]
*  It would be kind of a pro forma thing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  In this case, it's being kept very limited just to those two members. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=192.66s)]
*  And again, they're just receiving a briefing from the Trump transition team. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=195.98s)]
*  They're not hearing it directly from the FBI. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=201.06s)]
*  That's also a key point. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=203.5s)]
*  It's not required to be. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=204.94s)]
*  It's the transition team that presents it to Congress. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=206.38s)]
*  I imagine that it is possible that Democrats could suggest that they would like to hear [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=208.66s)]
*  from the FBI, but I don't know what the process would be or if there's a precedent for that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  And then there's the reality that they're requesting and there's no real teeth behind [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=217.24s)]
*  the demand to force someone into actually giving that kind of a briefing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=221.12s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  It's really up to what they choose to let, you know, let those two members of Congress [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=226.14s)]
*  not even the full committee. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  Then when you think about Democrats, and I have a sense from my sources of where they're [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=233.5s)]
*  going to be going in some of these confirmation hearings, you know, I think the way that one [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=237.5s)]
*  Democratic aide put it to me is they want to sort of begin signposting where the problems [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=242.26s)]
*  and the resumes are for these people so that when mistakes come, if these folks are concerned, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=247.1s)]
*  which it sounds like many of them likely will be, Democrats are able to turn around and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=251.7s)]
*  say to the American people, we told you that would happen. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  What are some of the things specifically with Hegseth that you expect Democrats to bring [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=258.18s)]
*  up during this hearing? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=261.56s)]
*  I think one of the major things that we're going to hear about is, of course, his drinking. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  We reported back in the fall that he was known for being publicly intoxicated at work events [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=266.82s)]
*  to the point that he needed to be carried out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  And our reporting indicated that although he has claimed that that is no longer an issue, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=274.62s)]
*  that he had been drink—that sources had smelled alcohol on him as recently as the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=279.22s)]
*  fall. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=283.5s)]
*  That was at Fox. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=284.5s)]
*  So he was at Fox that he had been drinking on the job, but at the veterans' organizations [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=285.82s)]
*  as well and in other kind of professional capacities. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=289.66s)]
*  So that's going to be a real concern because for Secretary of Defense, there is no more [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=293.06s)]
*  critical—it is a 24-7 job, and it is a job of judgment constantly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=296.66s)]
*  Most Secretaries of Defense never drink alcohol during their term at all. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=301.38s)]
*  I think more critically, where we're going to see the more explosive things, is around [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=305.14s)]
*  allegations of sexual assault. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=308.42s)]
*  There's this very well-documented report of an accused—alleged sexual assault in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=310.66s)]
*  Monterey, California. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=316.22s)]
*  There's an exhaustive police report that has been made public. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=317.22s)]
*  But we have not heard from the accuser or others that would corroborate that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=320.54s)]
*  And I think that signposting, that's where we're going to see the potential because [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=325.42s)]
*  it is such an explosive allegation, and we just have so little information. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=330.06s)]
*  Senators on the Hill were also trying to make the point—I think Senator Lindsey Graham [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=335.42s)]
*  was one of them who said, if this allegation is out there, which it certainly is, and that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=338.62s)]
*  police report is exhaustive—you and I both have read it—Graham is saying they should [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=342.46s)]
*  come forward, they should testify, to any sense that that's something that would happen. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=346.62s)]
*  As of right now, we don't have that sense that has been suggested. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=351.62s)]
*  But based on the sources that we've been able to contact and get kind of some indications, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  it doesn't seem like there is a huge list of people that are planning to come forward, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=360.5s)]
*  if at all. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=364.74s)]
*  Hexeth attorney told us that he has not heard from the committee that there were plans for [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=366.18s)]
*  any additional witnesses. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=369.22s)]
*  So I think at this point, that looks unlikely, unless there's a big surprise. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=370.86s)]
*  And even without that, it's going to be a bruising, bruising hearing. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=373.94s)]
*  One of the senators on the Hill saying they're in for a train wreck this week, which I think [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=377.86s)]
*  is probably the right way to put it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=380.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=382.7s)]
*  Senior investigative producer and story editor for NBC News, Sarah Fitzpatrick, my friend, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=383.7s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=387.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieu1WrmqYg&t=395.74s)]
