# Intelligence suggests pro-Ukrainian group sabotaged Nord Stream pipelines, report says
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8)
*  Let's turn now to the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=0.0s)]
*  And there's new information this morning about last September's attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=2.24s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting new intelligence reviewed by U.S. officials indicates the attacks were carried out by a pro-Ukrainian group. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=8.76s)]
*  Explosions damaged the pipelines last September, leading to a global blame game that was still going on up to this week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=17.76s)]
*  Russia accused the West of destroying the pipelines, which transport its gas to Europe. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=25.06s)]
*  Now, the information reviewed by U.S. officials has led them to believe the saboteurs were most likely Ukrainian or Russian nationals, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  or some combination of the two that were trying to help Kiev. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=38.8s)]
*  The Times reports those officials say no American or British nationals were involved, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=42.4s)]
*  and that at this point there's no evidence that Ukrainian President Zelensky or his government were involved either. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=47.3s)]
*  The Ukrainian government has also denied it had anything to do with this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=53.4s)]
*  The officials added the explosives were likely planted with the help of experienced divers who did not appear to be working for either the military or intel services. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to the news, characterizing it as an attempt to, quote, divert attention. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=66.24s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News foreign correspondent Molly Hunter, who's on the other side of the Atlantic for us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=73.9s)]
*  Molly, good morning. Great to see you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=79.8s)]
*  So let's talk about this revelation here that the U.S. believes that it was a pro-Ukraine force that sabotaged the pipeline early on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=81.86s)]
*  A lot in the West suggested Russia did it. That seems like maybe not the case anymore. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=89.62s)]
*  Tell us the significance and also the strain it might put on the European allies. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=93.72s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, this is really significant. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=101.16s)]
*  And when you read that New York Times article and again, NBC News is not independently and independently confirmed that reporting, the U.S. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=102.8s)]
*  officials stress this could really be the first significant lead in this global blame game. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=109.34s)]
*  As you say, everyone has been talking about this, looking at this, trying to investigate it since September. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=113.96s)]
*  Of course, we are talking about Nord Stream one and Nord Stream two. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  It runs from they both run from Russia to Germany. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=121.5s)]
*  Now, many at the beginning, as you say, suggested that maybe it was Russians, that maybe it was even kind of people, allies of Ukraine, because Ukraine has opposed this project for so many years. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=125.5s)]
*  They've been citing it as a national security threat. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=135.3s)]
*  Of course, a very easy way for Russia to get their gas from Russia to Europe in this New York Times report, though, that there are a couple of kind of blaring gaps, which U.S. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=137.6s)]
*  officials admit they do not know. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=147.22s)]
*  They do not know who exactly the group is. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=148.5s)]
*  It does not specify the members of this group who would have kind of directed or paid for this operation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=151.22s)]
*  They are clear, though, as you mentioned, that these were heavily skilled, highly skilled divers with maybe past military experience, and they were clearly opponents of Putin. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=156.1s)]
*  Now, the article very clearly lays out, Jonathan, that President Zelensky is not implicated nor are his top lieutenants. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=165.22s)]
*  After the article was published in The New York Times, Jonathan, actually a very senior aide to President Zelensky tweeted out and I actually think we have that tweet. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=172.16s)]
*  Mikhailo Poltliak responded and he says, Although I enjoy collecting amusing conspiracy theories about the Ukrainian government, I have to say Ukraine has nothing to do with the Baltic Sea mishap and has no information about pro-Ukrainian sabotage groups. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=179.72s)]
*  What happened to the Nord Stream pipelines? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=194.62s)]
*  They sink, as the Russian Federation says itself. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  Now, to be very clear, of course, this may be the first significantly lots to come, though, on exactly who and how that happened. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=199.56s)]
*  And certainly we'll all be watching for the response from Germany, which already has some tensions between Berlin and Kiev as to how much Germany has been involved with their resistance. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JaOOwFSjS8&t=208.22000000000003s)]
