# Last night a great night for Ohioans, says House member
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo)
*  The Democratic Party secured several victories last night, providing a potential boost for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden ahead of his 2024 reelection campaign. Following the passage of Ohio's abortion [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  measure, the president celebrated the referendum writing in a statement, quote, Ohioans and voters [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=11.68s)]
*  across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=17.68s)]
*  abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, forced women to travel hundreds [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=23.6s)]
*  of miles for care and threatened to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health care [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=29.28s)]
*  that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. This extreme and dangerous agenda is [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=34.72s)]
*  out of step with the vast majority of Americans. In another tweet, the president also seemed to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=40.64s)]
*  take a swipe at the recent New York Times Santa College polls that have dominated the political [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  landscape in recent days. Those polls show Biden behind Donald Trump in a series of key swing [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Biden wrote this across the country tonight, democracy won and MAGA lost voters vote polls [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=56.48s)]
*  don't now let's go win next year. Joining us now Democratic Congresswoman Chantelle Brown of Ohio. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=63.44s)]
*  Congresswoman, so great to see you this morning. Let's start with your home state. Yes. There was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=69.6s)]
*  a real win for abortion rights. It's now been enshrined in Ohio's constitution. Tell us how [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=74.56s)]
*  we got there and how it makes you feel. Well, I am thrilled. And first of all, thank you for having [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=80.56s)]
*  me. Your show is appropriately named. Yes, but I am a fan. I am a fan. Last night was a great night [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=84.8s)]
*  for Ohioans. And I would be remiss if I did not think the volunteers and the voters who worked [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=92.08s)]
*  tirelessly to get us this victory, which I would like to say was the second step in the two step [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=97.2s)]
*  dance. You know, we had the August election where Secretary LaRose attempted to try to suppress [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=102.4s)]
*  silence and suffocate the voice of the voters by raising the threshold really designed to make it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  more difficult to pass this initiative that we voted for successfully last night. So I am incredibly [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=113.84s)]
*  excited that we have we're on the path to end the extreme abortion ban that had no exceptions [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=120.48s)]
*  for rape or incest. This will allow us to continue to have access to contraceptives like birth control [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=126.08s)]
*  pills, and it will give doctors the ability to provide emergency care in the event of a miscarriage [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=132.16s)]
*  without the fear of being criminalized or government interference. So certainly a big [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=138.24s)]
*  night for Democrats last night. And I think there as we look to the president just did looking [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=142.96s)]
*  towards 2024. Give us your sense here. I mean, we all saw the polls over the weekend. It's going to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=148.08s)]
*  be a tight race. I think we can all agree that it will be a tight race between the current president [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=154.0s)]
*  and likely the former president. How do you foresee that race shaping up? But also what role do you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=157.68s)]
*  think abortion, which again abortion rights again scored a victory last night, it also played a role [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=163.36s)]
*  in what we saw in Virginia where Democrats did well there too. What do you think kind of role it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=166.72s)]
*  will have next year? I think it's going to be critically important. We know that abortion is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=170.72s)]
*  a winning issue for Democrats. Many folks have written off Ohio as a red state. I often like to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=174.88s)]
*  echo the sentiments of my former chair of the Ohio Democratic Party who likes to say that Ohio is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=180.4s)]
*  more rigged than it is red. And I think this issue proves that. I also would like to say that we know [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=186.24s)]
*  polls don't vote as President Biden said, and polls have never been favorable for him. We like to tell [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=191.76s)]
*  folks that when they count Joe Biden out, he shows them that they don't know how to count. We know [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=198.48s)]
*  that polls are simply a snapshot in time and it's kind of early to predict the weather for next year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=203.2s)]
*  So I think that in the in the political landscape, we have a phrase that there's only two ways to run [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  and that's unopposed or scared. And so those numbers are frightening. So we will be we will [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=215.12s)]
*  be working really hard. Some Democrats have said that to me last couple of days is that first of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=219.44s)]
*  all, yes, that Biden was was seen as down in 20 and 22 and still one Biden slash Democrats, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=223.68s)]
*  but also that this those polls could be motivating for Democrats. Hey, we have a lot of work to do [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  in this next year. So let's let's let's shift to governing. We're only a few days, frankly, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=233.68s)]
*  until the government funding runs out again. November 17th is the is the deadline we covered [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=240.24s)]
*  earlier in the show. The Republicans are talking about some options there. How concerned are you [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=244.96s)]
*  that we may be facing a shutdown? What's your read so far about the new speaker's approach? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=250.0s)]
*  What you're willing to what are you willing to vote for? Well, Mike Mike is making it very, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=254.0s)]
*  very clear that it's going to be challenging. You know, we saw this actually start in January [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=258.96s)]
*  where they were 15 rounds to speak to pick the first speaker, Speaker McCarthy. And then we [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=264.96s)]
*  went another four or five rounds to get Mike Mike elected. And I don't foresee this being the best [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=269.12s)]
*  outcome for the country. They have demonstrated that they have been the party of chaos and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=276.48s)]
*  confusion, deflection and distraction. And we have been focused on putting people over politics. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  In fact, I don't know if it was an oversight or intentional, but he said he refused to put people [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=286.24s)]
*  over politics. And I think that is indicative of what we can expect as it relates to his governing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=292.48s)]
*  All right, busy week or two ahead for you. We're so glad you joined us this morning. Come back [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=297.44s)]
*  soon. Democratic congressman Chantel Brown of Ohio. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLWPFiGJeo&t=301.92s)]
