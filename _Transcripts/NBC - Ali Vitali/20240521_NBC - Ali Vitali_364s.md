# Biden set to travel to New Hampshire to announce milestone in PACT Act
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE)
*  President Joe Biden will travel to New Hampshire today where he is expected to announce a major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=0.0s)]
*  milestone for the PACT Act. The president will address veterans and their families at an event [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=4.8s)]
*  in Nashua. The PACT Act, which boosts health care for veterans who were exposed to toxic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=10.32s)]
*  substances like Agent Orange, was signed into law back in 2022. Since then, the law has provided [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=14.72s)]
*  over 880,000 veterans and survivors with disability benefits. Joining us now, White House [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=21.76s)]
*  reporter for the Wall Street Journal, our friend Ken Thomas. Ken, good to see you. Certainly the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=28.96s)]
*  PACT Act, a major milestone, one personal for this president because of his son Bo, who he believes [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=33.52s)]
*  his cancer may have been caused by chemicals he was exposed to while serving in the Middle East. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  But there's also a political consideration. New Hampshire, which is always tight, tends to go [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=42.64s)]
*  blue in recent cycles, but you say it's a state that Biden needs to keep his eye on. Tell us why. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=47.92s)]
*  Yeah, John, it's one of those states that right now is outside the realm of the battleground map, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=54.32s)]
*  I would say. But it's always a competitive place and it's a state that's full of independent voters [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=60.48s)]
*  who know Joe Biden and Donald Trump very well. You know, they've seen both of these candidates [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=67.44s)]
*  multiple times in recent years. And so it's just a place that if you're a Democrat, you can't allow [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=74.08s)]
*  it to slip out of your column. And so I think that's part of the reason why they're going up [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=81.12s)]
*  to New Hampshire today to talk about this relatively new law. There are a lot of veterans [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=86.0s)]
*  in New Hampshire. And, you know, as you mentioned, this is an issue that's near and dear to the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  president. You know, he blames these burn pits for his son Bo getting cancer. And so, you know, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=95.84s)]
*  I think this was something that he really wanted to make part of the law for veterans. And he's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  going to be ending the day in Boston to raise some money. And so there's also that consideration [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=109.92s)]
*  as well. Perfect segue, Ken. Fundraising. So we just got the new numbers and President Biden still [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=114.72s)]
*  has a significant advantage in terms of cash on hand. However, Republicans and Trump actually did [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  out raise him last month. Is that setting off any alarms among the Biden reelection team or they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=126.16s)]
*  still feel good where they are? No, I think they felt like this was going to be a stretch in which [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=131.04s)]
*  Trump was going to out raise them simply because he can now raise jointly with the Republican [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=137.36s)]
*  National Committee. The amount of money that you can raise per donor goes way up, you know, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=142.88000000000002s)]
*  more than eight hundred thousand per donor. So this is typically the time in the presidential [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  cycle when the challenger will begin to out raise the incumbent. You know, we saw it with Mitt Romney [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=153.44000000000003s)]
*  in 2012, for example. So, you know, I think they feel pretty good about their position in terms of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=158.96s)]
*  cash on hand. And the Biden campaign will say, you know, look, how are you using the money? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=165.2s)]
*  You know, we're building an infrastructure in these battleground states. And in many cases, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=169.76s)]
*  there's there's not a big Trump presence. You know, I was in Michigan over the weekend and, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=175.04s)]
*  you know, the Michigan Republican Party has been very dysfunctional, whereas Biden is opening up [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=180.88s)]
*  all of these offices around the state and in a close race. And, you know, that could make a big [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=186.0s)]
*  difference. Yeah, certainly more blocking and tackling in the Democratic side right now. Let's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=192.08s)]
*  stay on the actual map for one more beat. A quick one. Trump was in Minnesota a few days ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=197.12s)]
*  Republicans really pounding their chests about the chance to win Minnesota or Virginia. States that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=200.96s)]
*  have pretty reliably gone blue. The Biden campaign's anything to that? Are they going to have to play [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  there? I don't think so. I mean, they sent some surrogates out. You know, you saw the governor [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=210.56s)]
*  and Senator Smith was out there as well, you know, pushing back against Trump. I don't think the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=217.44s)]
*  Biden campaign sees that as a big threat right now. It's certainly something that's very [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=223.92s)]
*  important to Trump. I think they felt like in 2016, if they had had maybe another week, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  they might have been able to put Minnesota in the Republican column. But again, it's one of these [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=235.2s)]
*  states that's sort of outside the battleground realm. And if we start seeing more travel into [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  places like New Hampshire, Minnesota, Virginia, places like that, we might look at this as a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=246.56s)]
*  potential expansion map for Trump. But I don't think that's the case right now. All right, Ken, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=252.8s)]
*  so last night, the president had some pretty strong words of support for Israel at a White [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=258.08s)]
*  House event yesterday honoring Jewish American Heritage Month, including saying that what's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=262.24s)]
*  happening in Gaza, not genocide. Tell us a little bit more about these comments and why it's such a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=267.92s)]
*  politically precarious situation for him. Yeah, I mean, this was really a standby Israel kind of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=272.72s)]
*  speech yesterday. You know, he's trying to thread the needle to maintain support among Jewish [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=278.56s)]
*  Americans who are pro-Israel, while at the same time, you know, reaching out to progressives who [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=285.92s)]
*  don't like what they see in Gaza right now. You know, we saw him over the weekend in his [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=292.88000000000005s)]
*  Morehouse speech saying that, you know, I hear you, I hear the protesters, and I'm listening to you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=298.24s)]
*  But at the same time, I think he feels strongly like this ICC finding was outrageous, as he put it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  And you noticed in this speech at the White House yesterday, he said he will stand with Israel [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=314.88s)]
*  against the butchers of Hamas. And so this is one of those cases where it's a real challenge [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=320.56s)]
*  to placate both sides. And I think they're hoping for some kind of deal with the hostages that will [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=327.84s)]
*  allow them to move forward. Yeah, desperate for that ceasefire deal for lots of reasons. Covering [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=334.4s)]
*  a lot of ground for us this morning. White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Ken, thank you as always. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm4jiMda9VE&t=342.56s)]
