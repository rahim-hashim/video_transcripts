# DeSantis set to unveil plan to remove so-called 'wokeness' from the military
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA)
*  Act today, Florida governor and 2024 White House hopeful Ron DeSantis will unveil a plan to remove the so-called wokeness from, wait for it, the United States military. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=0.0s)]
*  On Twitter yesterday, a press secretary for the DeSantis campaign posted the governor's plan to target social and political agendas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=12.0s)]
*  The campaign's rapid response account also teased today's announcement in a new ad. Take a listen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=20.0s)]
*  As somebody that really appreciated wearing the uniform, really appreciated serving alongside patriots, being a part of a mission greater than yourself, you look at today's military, it's going woke. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=27.0s)]
*  Shut up and be proud of Admiral Rachel. I want to understand why, Rach. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=39.0s)]
*  You are pursuing a social agenda in the military rather than having your eye on the ball. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=43.0s)]
*  So as president and commander in chief on day one, we rip it all out of the military. All the Obama-Biden nonsense is gone and we're restoring it to its glory. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=49.0s)]
*  Joining us now, someone who has a firsthand look at Governor DeSantis' policies, Democratic state representative, Ana Escamani of the state of Florida. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=59.0s)]
*  Thank you for being with us, representative. Let's start there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=69.0s)]
*  DeSantis going after the military is just the latest example of this anti-woke crusade that he is on, frankly, and he keeps saying he wants America to look like Florida. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=74.0s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about what that has meant for Florida, what has anti-woke agenda has meant for your state. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=85.0s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. Let me tell the American people, you do not want to mimic Florida right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=92.0s)]
*  We have an affordability crisis. Inflation is actually worse in our state compared to the rest of the country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=98.0s)]
*  Floridians cannot afford their housing, their property insurance. We have food insecurity. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=103.0s)]
*  And of course, everyday problems that are not being solved because Governor DeSantis is nowhere to be seen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=108.0s)]
*  And he focuses on these fake bogeyman type of culture wars that ignores the very real economic woes taking place in our state. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=115.0s)]
*  So let's talk about some of those economic woes. You represent an area that includes Disney World, I believe, of which the governor, of course, has been waging a battle with for some time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=125.0s)]
*  Talk to us about what the real world implications have been from that for your very constituents. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=136.0s)]
*  Well, that's the irony. You know, Governor DeSantis and his cronies are attacking employers versus trying to entice more to come, whether it's with theme parks or even insurance companies. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=142.0s)]
*  You know, their entire M.O. is to attack companies or call them woke if they make them upset versus try to create an economy that works for everyone. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=152.0s)]
*  And of course, I think the anti-immigrant bill, Senate Bill 1718, is a very good example of this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=161.0s)]
*  Here's a bill that demonizes immigrant workers who are a key component of our economy from agriculture to tourism to construction. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=167.0s)]
*  So we're demonizing employers. We're demonizing workers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=176.0s)]
*  And no wonder things in our state are unaffordable and that employers are struggling to hire people, let alone have the incentive to come call Florida home. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=180.0s)]
*  And then let me ask you lastly, I mean, immigration has been, of course, a big thing for him. You just mentioned it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=189.0s)]
*  We also know that he's flown migrants around the country, including to Martha's Vineyard and other locations. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=194.0s)]
*  What do you feel like right now is the state of Florida a hospitable place for immigrants, people who want to live in this country? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=200.0s)]
*  The state of Florida, and I say this as a Florida born and raised Orlandonian, we're not welcoming many people of different cultural backgrounds and economic classes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=211.0s)]
*  And I do think that this offers the Biden administration and President Biden opportunity to be that contrast, to help lead on immigration reform, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=223.0s)]
*  help lead on issues that impact working class people and really provide a vision for this country and for our state. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=230.0s)]
*  Because right now we do not have one under Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=237.0s)]
*  All right. Well, we really appreciate your perspective this morning. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=241.0s)]
*  Democratic state representative for the state of Florida, Ana Eskamani, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=243.0s)]
*  Up next here on Way Too Early, we'll get into President Biden's reelection campaign by the numbers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=249.0s)]
*  And then coming up on Morning Joe, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump's new plans for the scope of presidential power if he were to win a second term. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=254.0s)]
*  Plus, we'll bring you live reporting from New Hampshire, where Democratic Senator Joe Manchin and former Republican Governor John Huntsman appeared to be flirting with a third party ticket, one that many Democrats vehemently oppose. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=264.0s)]
*  And also ahead, Oscar winning composer, songwriter and singer David Byrne is a guest. You won't want to miss that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=277.0s)]
*  Morning Joe, just a few moments of your time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=284.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbMzph5gXFA&t=307.0s)]
