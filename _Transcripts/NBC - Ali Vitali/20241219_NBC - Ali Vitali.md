# Gabbard finished with meetings until the new year
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8)
*  Let's do a little bit of news here before the top of the hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=0.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, who of course is president-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead America's intelligence [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=2.92s)]
*  agencies, was back on Capitol Hill yesterday for her last round of meetings with senators [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=8.28s)]
*  until the new year. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=12.8s)]
*  Gabbard is seen as potentially the most troubled choice for Trump's cabinet with little intelligence [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=14.16s)]
*  experience and a history of controversial comments on Russia and Syria. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=19.38s)]
*  Here's some of what she had to say yesterday to reporters. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=24.04s)]
*  How did the meetings go? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=27.44s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=28.8s)]
*  Today's been a great day. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=29.3s)]
*  Every day's been a great day. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=30.64s)]
*  There are more to come. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=32.0s)]
*  With regards to the point that as many as eight Republicans have doubts about your confirmation, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=33.44s)]
*  is that what you've gathered from your meetings so far? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=38.08s)]
*  I'm not going to comment on some anonymous reporting that means nothing without names [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=40.96s)]
*  and attached to it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Has the situation in Syria impacted how these meetings have gone? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=50.84s)]
*  Have you been asked about that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=56.44s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the content of those conversations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=58.44s)]
*  Every one of them has been valuable and constructive. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=61.64s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth, two names that seem to be the most troubled. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=66.04s)]
*  Hegseth's meetings with senators at least appear to be going well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=69.84s)]
*  We're hearing from inside the room, Gabbard's less so, that it's actually raising more questions [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=72.64s)]
*  than answering. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=77.72s)]
*  Look, the fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria has worldwide monumental implications for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=78.72s)]
*  lots of people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=85.72s)]
*  But also for Tulsi Gabbard, pretty poor timing for her. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=86.72s)]
*  Yes, she's shown great openness to Assad, affinity perhaps even to Assad and to Vladimir [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=89.32s)]
*  Putin we should add as well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=94.52s)]
*  This is something we've talked about a lot on Morning Joe, which is when we talk to Republicans [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=96.12s)]
*  privately they say, look, we'll get you, Donald Trump, a loyalist, someone who's going to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=100.12s)]
*  basically do what you want them to do in terms of national intelligence, but not her. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=104.72s)]
*  There's somebody who has, they don't trust with the intelligence secrets of this country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=109.92s)]
*  And so perhaps, I think yesterday we saw a lot of people saying, we had productive meetings, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=115.52s)]
*  we're open to the possibility. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=120.0s)]
*  We didn't hear a lot of full-throated endorsements. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=121.44s)]
*  A couple said I'm on board. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=123.36s)]
*  But again, it doesn't take many. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=125.36s)]
*  And if there are in fact eight or if there are even six Republicans or even five Republicans [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=126.92s)]
*  who say no, she could be in jeopardy. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=130.88s)]
*  It's just this whole dynamic that we're going to talk about in a minute on Morning Joe of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=134.4s)]
*  Donald Trump and yes, Elon Musk pulling the strings on everything that happens in the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=138.28s)]
*  government before he's even president of the United States. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=143.08s)]
*  Is Donald Trump going to call these senators? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=146.32s)]
*  Is he going to call these Republicans and say, do this or else? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=148.28s)]
*  He is seeing how far he can push them on everything, including maybe Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=152.12s)]
*  Yeah, a preview of the tumult to come, no doubt. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=156.36s)]
*  Much to get to this morning. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=159.88s)]
*  Willie, guys, thank you for today and for all the counsel help over the course. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=161.2s)]
*  Congrats on a great run. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=163.92s)]
*  Thank you, Willie. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=164.92s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gDqAsUU7K8&t=165.92s)]
