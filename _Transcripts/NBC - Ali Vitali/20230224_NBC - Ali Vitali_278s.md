# Ukraine war enters its second year
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o)
*  Joining us now, Global Affairs Analyst and Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council, Michael Bossercue. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael, thank you for joining us so early. What do you make of this new sanctions package, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=6.16s)]
*  the new aid package announced by the White House? How significant is it at this course of the war? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=11.28s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. Well, you know, on as somber of a day as today is, it would have been [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=18.32s)]
*  really nice to have seen something a bit more matching to what the Ukrainians, the Zelensky [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=24.88s)]
*  administration actually is asking for. We all know that what that is by now, those attack helicopters, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=31.2s)]
*  jets, more ability to close its skies and very crucially also our longer range on the U.S. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=37.44s)]
*  supplied missiles so that Ukraine can strike legitimate military targets within Russia, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  the exact sites that are from where missiles are being sent this way to Kiev and elsewhere. So, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=52.64s)]
*  sanctions are good, but I think we've discovered after one year of this war that they don't have [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=58.96s)]
*  the bite that they were designed to. I think to a great extent, sanctions have been something for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=67.04s)]
*  Western leaders to pat themselves on the back with and say, we've done something. Well, let's pick [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=73.44s)]
*  up on that. What is the state of Russia's economy? The idea was that a sanctions regime [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=78.88s)]
*  would cripple it. Russia would isolate itself from the global economy. Europe would cut off all the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=84.24s)]
*  energy sources from Russia. Is the Russia economy in a significantly worse state today than it was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=90.64s)]
*  one year ago? Yeah, certain parts of it for sure. I mean, you know, right off the bat, probably, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=98.08s)]
*  not probably, but for sure, half of their foreign reserves were frozen. Energy revenues have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=106.0s)]
*  fallen a lot, for example, because of countries like Germany lessening their dependence, Moldova [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=111.6s)]
*  as well. But, you know, we have to recognize that for the past few years, the Chinese have been [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=116.8s)]
*  helping the Russians actually to inoculate themselves from Western sanctions. So, there's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  been a lot more cooperation on that front that has helped Russia. And who knows, maybe in the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=129.44s)]
*  days ahead, if the Americans release new intelligence, we'll find out whether the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=135.04s)]
*  Chinese are also supplying Russia with lethal weaponry. But the Russians have quite the ability [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=140.0s)]
*  to ramp up certain sectors of their economy, defense production, that sort of thing. A heck [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  of a lot of money still coming in from the sale of oil to places like India and China. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=154.88s)]
*  And Michael, let me ask you this. You know, one year ago, the assumption was this would be a very [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=159.68s)]
*  quick war. Russia would overtake Ukraine. It would be a matter of weeks, maybe months. Obviously, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=164.56s)]
*  Ukraine is still standing. And for that, they feel triumphant. But, you know, it also looks like, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=169.68s)]
*  going forward, this could be a very long drawn-out war, and that might be very somber for Ukraine. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=175.28s)]
*  So what is the mood in Kiev today? Yeah, well, I've, I crossed over just from the border of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Poland into Ukraine around midnight. So I've been talking to people on the train. I've been talking [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  to people on the ground here. I've been living on Ukraine since before the start of the war. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=191.68s)]
*  So it's pretty somber today. Walking outside on the streets, there are a lot fewer people than [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=196.24s)]
*  you'd normally see. But, you know, as to your question about the timing and everything, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=200.96s)]
*  I think had the West grown the spine to supply Ukraine with lethal weaponry before the war [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=206.08s)]
*  actually started, we would be in a different position today. I firmly believe that. I think [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=213.44s)]
*  Ukraine would have had the ability to push the Russians back all the way, because, you know, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=218.4s)]
*  we cannot overstate this enough that if Mr. Putin is not pushed back now, he will try again, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=223.68s)]
*  and he will probably go further, perhaps into Baltic states or into even NATO countries. So [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=230.24s)]
*  this is very, very symbolically militarily important for him, for his own domestic audience. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=236.0s)]
*  And I don't think he will put down his arms unless there's a very strong pushback from Ukraine and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=241.52s)]
*  from the West. All right, we'll leave it there. Global Affairs Analyst and Senior Fellow at [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  the Atlantic Council, Michael Boskiw. Thank you so much. Stay safe in Ukraine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=253.68s)]
*  you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQGiBIU464o&t=278.08s)]
