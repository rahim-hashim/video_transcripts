# VP Kamala Harris makes media blitz
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI)
*  What kind of guns you own and when and why did you get it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=0.0s)]
*  I have a Glock and I've had it for quite some time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=4.0s)]
*  And I mean, look, Bill, my background is in law enforcement. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=9.0s)]
*  And so there you go. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=14.0s)]
*  Have you ever fired it? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=17.0s)]
*  Yes. Of course I have. At a shooting range? Yes, of course I have. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=19.0s)]
*  That was more from Vice President Kamala Harris's interview last night on 60 Minutes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=25.0s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for Bloomberg News, Josh Wingrove. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=30.0s)]
*  Josh, traveling with the Vice President who is here in New York on a media blitz. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=35.0s)]
*  The View, Howard Stern, Late Show with Stephen Colbert all coming after that 60 Minutes interview. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=39.0s)]
*  It's definitely a change in strategy, ramping up these appearances. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=45.0s)]
*  What's the thought process behind it and how do they think it's going so far, including in candid moments like that one? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=49.0s)]
*  On the heels also of her appearance on a major podcast, Call Her Daddy, as well as local interviews that she's been doing in battleground states. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=53.0s)]
*  This is a shift. They think they're basically at a point where she can come out and be on offense in terms of media. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=61.0s)]
*  Draw contrast, of course, with former President Trump, who is in some ways pulling in the other direction, not agreeing to a second debate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=66.0s)]
*  Said no to 60 Minutes, as was detailed in the report last night. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=73.0s)]
*  But in other ways has continued to do, including just last night, friendlier media interviews, rallies and that sort of thing. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=77.0s)]
*  So Harris is implicitly at least pushing back on criticism from Democrats who've wondered where she is and whether she would sort of come out more on the trail. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=83.0s)]
*  And so we'll see whether it comes to fruition for them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=92.0s)]
*  We have a new poll this morning from the New York Times, Santa College showing her up three on Donald Trump. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=97.0s)]
*  The latest polls actually have been more favorable for Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=101.0s)]
*  So this is good news for Harris in a sort of broader polls that are sort of showing a again narrowing race. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=105.0s)]
*  Retired, I'm sure, talking about it, but it just continues to be just looking like a very, very narrow race across maybe only a handful of battleground states. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=111.0s)]
*  Yeah, that time Santa College poll, it's a national poll, but it's also the first time she's had a lead in it over Trump. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=119.0s)]
*  Three points within the margin of error. But still, it's as you say, it's a potentially a sign of of some momentum. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=124.0s)]
*  So let's talk about some of the battleground states. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=129.0s)]
*  You mentioned this is an election that's being fought over just seven states, probably. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=131.0s)]
*  We also have a new pullout in Michigan this morning that shows her up a couple points there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=135.0s)]
*  Talk to us about how her team is feeling about the electric college map right now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=139.0s)]
*  What's the focus? I mean, their official view is that there continue to be multiple paths. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=143.0s)]
*  And the way to boil that down is that no one knows where Georgia and North Carolina are going to go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=147.0s)]
*  Of course, everyone is praying for the recovery efforts of Hurricane Helen and the incoming Hurricane Milton. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=152.0s)]
*  It's too early to really ask or know or say what impact all of that will have on election turnout in those states. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=159.0s)]
*  But most Democrats will tell you their path continues to be through those blue wall states in the north that can get them with Nebraska and no other changes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=164.0s)]
*  Just to 270 on the nose. So Pennsylvania in many ways remains the battleground. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=171.0s)]
*  That's why we've seen or will continue to see, I think, Biden in particular, when he makes his sort of brief moments on the campaign trail. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=176.0s)]
*  He'll sort of focus on his birth state there where maybe he can help Harris drive some turnout. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=183.0s)]
*  Just remains a close one. And so we're watching also the money issue. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=187.0s)]
*  Trump continues to have spent more than he is taking in. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=192.0s)]
*  Harris continues to have reasonable money. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=195.0s)]
*  But you wonder whether the fundraising base will keep pace with what has been a big surge since she became the nominee. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=198.0s)]
*  So a lot of moving parts. President Biden today in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=203.0s)]
*  Lastly, Democrats look at the stereotype. They're always worried. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=207.0s)]
*  But Democrats in the last week or so had been really worried about her lack of media appearances. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=210.0s)]
*  It does seem like she's doing that. She's they wanted her campaign more. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=214.0s)]
*  She's there. She's doing that. We also did hear from Michigan Congresswoman Dingle and Slock and both saying, hey, we this feels like 2016. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=217.0s)]
*  We're worried here. But does the Harris team agree? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=224.0s)]
*  Do they feel good about Michigan? I think right now they're not counting any chickens. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=227.0s)]
*  I think is how I'd put that. And, you know, we'll see whether she does more interviews. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=231.0s)]
*  I appreciate you keeping this chair open for her and letting me slide in at the last moment. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=235.0s)]
*  Vice President, any time delighted to be here. Yeah, I think they're not. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=239.0s)]
*  The polling Michigan and to a certain extent, Wisconsin is generally look pretty stronger than the polling in Pennsylvania and other battleground states. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=242.0s)]
*  Again, if the Harris campaign was sitting here, they would say that I'm getting ahead of myself, I'm sure. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=250.0s)]
*  But broadly speaking, Democrats don't seem as worried with those two as they do in states like Pennsylvania. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=255.0s)]
*  I think we're going to see Trump and Harris in Pennsylvania just, you know, every few days basically going forward in these last few months. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=260.0s)]
*  Of course, Pennsylvania is one of the states where voting has already begun. Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=267.0s)]
*  The most important state on the map this time around. No question about it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=269.0s)]
*  Terrific reporting as always from White House reporter for Bloomberg News, Josh Wingriff. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=272.0s)]
*  Josh, thank you so much. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=276.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTmOKkzjTDI&t=297.0s)]
