Video Description: Republican leaders are advocating for a new election 'integrity' bill designed to prevent non-citizen voting, an issue studies show is rare. The bill's stringent voter registration requirements, including proof of U.S. citizenship, have drawn concerns from voting rights advocates about accessibility for millions of Americans. Christina Greer joins Way Too Early, arguing that such measures reflect ongoing Republican efforts to restrict voter access, targeting demographics likely to oppose their policies.

# 'Not on the right side of history': Greer condemns GOP election 'integrity' bill
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo)
*  Some of the Republican leaders who tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=0.0s)]
*  are now calling on Congress to pass what they're calling an election integrity bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=5.0s)]
*  They say the new legislation will prevent non-citizens from voting in U.S. elections, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=10.0s)]
*  something that multiple studies have repeatedly shown is exceedingly rare. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=15.0s)]
*  The measure would make it more difficult to register people to vote by requiring the verification of a U.S. passport or birth certificate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=21.0s)]
*  Voting rights advocates note that millions of Americans do not have easy access to those documents. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=27.0s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson, who's leading the effort, played a pivotal role in former President Trump's push to overturn the election four years ago. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=32.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Moynihan Public Scholar Fellow at the City College of New York, Professor Christina Greer. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=41.0s)]
*  Professor, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=48.0s)]
*  I'll wait. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=50.0s)]
*  Of course, it is hypocrisy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=51.0s)]
*  These election deniers are calling for election integrity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=53.0s)]
*  But let's talk about these efforts and are they should we be worried about their mechanics to under to prevent voters from voting? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=56.0s)]
*  But also what it says big picture about how a significant portion of one party views the democratic process in America and their efforts to undercut it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, we should always be worried when people move the gold post. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=75.0s)]
*  But if we zoom out, we can look at Republicans and recognize the vast majority of their policies just aren't in lockstep with what Americans want. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=79.0s)]
*  And that's why they have to keep making it more difficult for Americans to have access to the ballot. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=87.0s)]
*  We've seen this time and time again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=92.0s)]
*  There is, you know, trying to decrease mail in voting or whether it's trying to make it much more difficult for young people to vote or older people to vote. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=94.0s)]
*  This is going at the heart of their foundation where, you know, only certain people are the real Americans. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=103.0s)]
*  When you look at the issues, whether it's LGBTQ plus rights, where more and more Americans are becoming more inclusive and accepted when you look at abortion, which is a huge issue, not just in Ohio, but in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, where they definitely need votes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=108.0s)]
*  They know that they are just not on the right side of history and they're not on the right side of the ballot box. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=122.0s)]
*  So they have to make it much more difficult for people to have access to President Biden was in Wisconsin yesterday, mostly on economic issues, which polls suggest he's struggling to win over the majority. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=127.0s)]
*  Struggling to win over voters with. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=137.0s)]
*  But afterwards, he gave that interview and he did talk about Donald Trump in the next election. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=139.0s)]
*  He more or less said, I guarantee that he won't accept the result were he to lose. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=144.0s)]
*  How would you counsel the president to keep to speak about this? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=149.0s)]
*  Because on one hand, polls suggest it's the kitchen table issues that are going to decide this election, as well as things like you mentioned, abortion. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=152.0s)]
*  But like democracy, the president believes is at stake. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=159.0s)]
*  How does he balance that in his messaging? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=162.0s)]
*  It's really hard, Jonathan, because so many Americans are really worried about the bottom line. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=165.0s)]
*  But when you think about what Joe Biden is trying to lay out, you know, if you have someone who believes in a dictatorship, if you have someone believes in grifting, if you have someone who believes in giving, you know, parts of American's economy to the highest bidder, especially our foreign adversaries, that is a pocketbook issue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=170.0s)]
*  You know, what will happen to labor in this country? What will happen to jobs? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=190.0s)]
*  What will happen to our educational system for people to actually have prospects for jobs? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=193.0s)]
*  So Joe Biden's asking people to have both a short term and a long term conversation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=197.0s)]
*  The long term conversation is not something that we've been great at as a nation. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=202.0s)]
*  We've got a very short term memory when we go to the ballot box. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=205.0s)]
*  But we are literally looking at a Republican candidate who's saying that he will not respect the will of law. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=208.0s)]
*  He's saying that he will enrich himself and his friends. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=214.0s)]
*  He is saying all the things that he's going to do to immigrants, to vulnerable communities, to marginalized communities. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=217.0s)]
*  And there's unfortunately large swath of Americans who don't believe him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=223.0s)]
*  And there's a large swath of Americans who actually support him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=227.0s)]
*  And lastly, we showed some polls earlier in the show to basically a dead heat between Biden and Trump in a couple key battleground states. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=230.0s)]
*  But it's also a striking that third party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was in the double digits, 12 to 13, 17 percent in these numbers. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=237.0s)]
*  Do we think is that real? Do you think is that is that someone is he going to actually pick up those votes or is that an anger that people are expressing now because they're not happy with the choices? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=244.0s)]
*  And who does who do you think he would hurt most? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=254.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Jonathan, it's hard to say. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=258.0s)]
*  This reminds me of 1992 with Ross Perot. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=261.0s)]
*  Don't forget, Ross Perot got almost 19 million votes, but no electoral college vote. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=263.0s)]
*  He definitely affected the race, especially for George H.W. Bush. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=267.0s)]
*  So, you know, as we sort of continue with our interventions abroad and people feel pocketbook issues at home, I think that conversation in closer talk over will be much more clear as to the effect of R.F.K. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=271.0s)]
*  Jr. and the one in his head and the worm in his head on that note, we will leave it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=284.0s)]
*  Moynihan Public Scholar Fellow at the City College of New York, Professor Krenis, Tina Greer. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=290.0s)]
*  Thank you as always. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=295.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8W-lZ0ZOo&t=301.0s)]
