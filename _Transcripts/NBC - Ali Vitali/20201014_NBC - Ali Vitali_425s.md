# Barrett Takes 'Cautious' Approach On Election Question | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA)
*  Welcome back. Senate confirmation hearings continue this morning for President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=0.0s)]
*  Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. She faced tough questions from Democrats yesterday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=6.32s)]
*  who've tried to portray her nomination as a potential threat to health care, abortion [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=11.28s)]
*  rights and more. In one notable moment, she was asked about whether the president could [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=15.88s)]
*  delay the upcoming election, an idea that President Trump floated earlier this year. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=21.18s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=26.92s)]
*  Does the Constitution give the President of the United States the authority to unilaterally [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  delay a general election under any circumstances? Does federal law? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=34.440000000000005s)]
*  Well, Senator, if that question ever came before me, I would need to hear arguments [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  from the litigants and read briefs and consult with my law clerks and talk to my colleagues [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  and go through the opinion writing process. So, you know, if I give off-the-cuff answers, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=52.0s)]
*  then I would be basically a legal pundit. And I don't think we want judges to be legal [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=57.44s)]
*  pundits. I think we want judges to approach cases thoughtfully and with an open mind. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  Do you believe that every president should make a commitment, unequivocally and resolutely, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=68.88s)]
*  to the peaceful transfer of power? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=74.84s)]
*  Well, Senator, that seems to me to be pulling me in a little bit into this question of whether [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=79.36s)]
*  the president has said that he would not peacefully leave office. And so, to the extent that this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  is a political controversy right now, as a judge, I want to stay out of it. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Stay out of it. Barrett was also pressed on abortion rights yesterday. She told the Senate [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Judiciary Committee that the landmark Roe v. Wade case, which legalized abortion nationwide, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=106.64s)]
*  should not be categorized as a quote unquote super precedent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=112.16s)]
*  Is Roe a super precedent? How would you define super precedent? I'm answering a lot of questions [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=117.4s)]
*  about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn't fall in that category. You said that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=122.52s)]
*  Brown is, and I know my time is running out, is a super precedent. That's something the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=127.12s)]
*  Supreme Court has not even said, but you have said that. So if you say that, why won't [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=132.72s)]
*  you say that about Roe v. Wade? As Richard Fallon from Harvard said, Roe is not a super [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=138.44s)]
*  precedent because calls for its overruling have never ceased, but that doesn't mean [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=144.28s)]
*  that Roe should be overruled. It just means that it doesn't fall on the small handful [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  of cases like Marbury v. Madison and Brown v. the Board that no one questions anymore. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=153.84s)]
*  Barrett would not say how she would rule on Roe v. Wade if she were presented with a challenge [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=161.44s)]
*  to the case, but she has suggested that Roe was wrongly decided in the past. Joining us [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=167.84s)]
*  now, MSNBC legal analyst, Dani Savalos. Dani, good morning. It is great to see you this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=172.68s)]
*  morning. I actually want to start with what we heard in the beginning there, those political [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=178.12s)]
*  questions about the election, delaying the election and the transfer of power. Can you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=183.44s)]
*  walk us through exactly what it is that sets the timing of the election, the laws that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=190.0s)]
*  we have? My colleague, Pete Williams, yesterday called this a potentially overly cautious [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=194.96s)]
*  answer from her, and that is, of course, understated as Pete often is. But I think a lot of us were [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=201.8s)]
*  surprised she wasn't willing to go farther considering what the law actually says on [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=208.16s)]
*  this topic. As is often the case, Pete Williams is exactly [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=214.88s)]
*  right. The Constitution provides for the exact day of the presidential election. And had [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=218.8s)]
*  the question been asked another way, I think Professor, excuse me, Judge Barrett could [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  have answered it. If the question were what does the Constitution say about the day of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=229.68s)]
*  the presidential election, Judge Barrett could have answered that, I believe. But asking [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=234.56s)]
*  about things like the peaceful transfer of power being more vague as a question or whether [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  or not the president can extend the election date. Those are issues that arguably can and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=246.12s)]
*  will come before Judge Barrett. And maybe we'll never know the truth, but Judge Barrett, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  it probably secretly resents the fact that the president has put her in this position [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=256.0s)]
*  where she has to answer that question or choose not to answer the question. But look, in an [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=260.56s)]
*  abundance of caution, the super careful approach for Judge Barrett was to say, well, this is [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=265.48s)]
*  an issue that may come before me. But certainly the strongest argument for questions that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=271.24s)]
*  she should have answered in that category would be that the peaceful transfer of power [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=275.64s)]
*  and whether or not voter intimidation is a crime. There's a strong argument to be made [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=281.08s)]
*  that she could have answered those questions, but she chose the ultra cautious route. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  Of course, she, as so many other people we've seen testify before Congress, has a critical [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=291.36s)]
*  audience of one in the White House that she has to consider as well as the typical caution [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  that would come with being in this particular hot seat. Let's talk about Roe versus Wade. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=301.84s)]
*  This question about whether it's a quote unquote super precedent. What's the legal reasoning [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=306.96s)]
*  there? And she, I know, has defined super precedent in the past as essentially saying [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  something that's so settled that people don't even want or think that it should be overturned. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=317.12s)]
*  This super precedent is a term of academic creation. It doesn't have the same legal significance [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=324.23999999999995s)]
*  as say sorry, decisis or even the word precedent itself. And some context is required. Judge [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=329.0s)]
*  Barrett, when she used super precedent, was responding to a list that other academics [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=334.6s)]
*  had prepared and come up with this term super duper precedent or super precedent. Pete Williams [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=340.12s)]
*  talked yesterday about there is actually a super duper precedent, believe it or not, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=345.48s)]
*  but those are academic constructs and Judge Barrett, it's true apparently. But Judge Barrett [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=349.68s)]
*  was responding to another academic's list of what those academics thought were super [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=355.96s)]
*  precedent. And that's why you had that awkward exchange of Judge Barrett saying, well, it [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=361.64s)]
*  depends what you mean by super precedent, because it does have different definitions [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  because it isn't a strict legal concept. It's more of an academic smoke-filled coffee house [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=370.52s)]
*  discussion concept. And so that was the reason for that back and forth with Senator Klobuchar. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  The bottom line is to say whether or not Roe is on a list of super precedent, you do need to define [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=382.36s)]
*  what your operative meaning is of super precedent, given that it's not really something that exists [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=387.4s)]
*  in stare decisis or judicial review. I would like to know which legal professors, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=392.92s)]
*  third grader came up with the term super duper precedent, because I have to think that it was [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=399.4s)]
*  someone in that age range. Okay, we'll give credit to Pete for that. Danny Savalos, thank you very [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=404.2s)]
*  much, my friend. It's great to see you this morning. Hope to see you again soon. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66y5_Av4lWA&t=410.04s)]
