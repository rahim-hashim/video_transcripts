# Vance denies Trump's 2020 election loss, again
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8)
*  Republican Senator JD Vance has now said that he does not believe that former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=0.0s)]
*  Speaking at two press events yesterday, the Republican vice presidential nominee confirmed his belief at the first event, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=8.0s)]
*  and then he gave a more fiery answer at the second. Let's watch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=16.0s)]
*  On the election of 2020, I've answered this question directly a million times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=20.0s)]
*  No, I think there are serious problems in 2020. So did Donald Trump lose the election not by the words that I would use? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=26.0s)]
*  I answered this question a million times when I ran for the Senate, the 2022 Republican primary. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=33.0s)]
*  I've answered this question in the 2022 general election. I've answered this question 10 times recently. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=40.0s)]
*  I think that Big Tech rigged the election in 2020. That's my view. And if you disagree with me, that's fine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=46.0s)]
*  I've given that exact question for years. And this is such a preposterous thing that the American media does. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=52.0s)]
*  I have given this answer to this question for literally years. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=61.0s)]
*  And the American media wants to focus on what happened four years ago than the fact that North Carolinians can't afford groceries. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=67.0s)]
*  I think that's a disgrace. Do your job and focus on the problems the American people care about rather than bullsh** from four years ago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=75.0s)]
*  I think the American people care about the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=83.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist and associate editor of the Washington Post, our friend Eugene Robinson. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=87.0s)]
*  Eugene, also, of course, an MSNBC political analyst. Eugene, JD Vance, after a couple of weeks of sort of dancing around the question, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=93.0s)]
*  he had a moment in the V.P. debate with Governor Walz about January 6th, about the 2020 election. Flat out, says it yesterday. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=101.0s)]
*  He believes the big lie. Yeah, right. He's got full. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=109.0s)]
*  I got the transformation of JD Vance is complete now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=112.0s)]
*  And there's no pretense of being the JD Vance that he used to be. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=116.0s)]
*  The Yale educated venture capitalist sort of modern Republican JD Vance that he pretended to be for a while. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=121.0s)]
*  Now he's just whatever Donald Trump says. And so so he says he didn't lose the election, therefore he didn't lose the election. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=130.0s)]
*  This is the most sort of insistent I've ever heard him on this point, which, of course, is not true. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=138.0s)]
*  It's just total fantasy. It's false. And it should be disqualifying. It's not in the mega world, but it should be. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=144.0s)]
*  So it's not the mega world. In fact, he was cheered as he said it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=153.0s)]
*  But there are still some voters out there trying to make up their minds. It's a small number, four percent, six percent electorate, whatever it might be. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=157.0s)]
*  This fiery defense of of of a lie and that repulse so many Americans. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=164.0s)]
*  How does this help win those voters? Well, it certainly doesn't convert anybody who's not already a Trump supporter. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=170.0s)]
*  And also, you know, he added this this thing about I believe big tech rigged the election. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=177.0s)]
*  So the obvious follow up question. OK, how did they do that? What is your evidence for that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=183.0s)]
*  Well, you know, so he has invited, in fact, more questions about this false and ridiculous and dangerous position he's taking. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=189.0s)]
*  So, Eugene, let's get your thoughts on Vice President Harris. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=201.0s)]
*  She she appeared alongside some Republican lawmakers yesterday, sort of creating that permission structure for others across the aisle. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=204.0s)]
*  And then she went into the lion's den and did an interview with Fox News. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=210.0s)]
*  I think she did. Oh, I think she's not a scratch on her. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=213.0s)]
*  I think she came out. Look, I think it was a really good moment for the Harris campaign. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=216.0s)]
*  And for a variety of reasons, don't listen to me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=222.0s)]
*  Listen to Fox commentators like Brith Hume and Dana Perino and Brett Baier himself who said later that, well, she came to have a moment and she got her moment. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=225.0s)]
*  Right. And I think he was probably referring to the moment when she called out the clip he had played from denying saying what he had said just minutes earlier and minutes later. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=234.0s)]
*  And so that was a very strong moment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=248.0s)]
*  But the other thing she did by going there and by getting her points across was introduce facts into Trump world that just weren't that are not spoken in Trump world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=251.0s)]
*  Like she's oh, I was just campaigning with 100 Republicans who support me instead of him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=264.0s)]
*  All of Trump's national security aides from his first administration are refused to support him this time because they say he's dangerous to our national security. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=270.0s)]
*  All of those even on their pet issue about gender reassignment surgery when she was able to get in. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=284.0s)]
*  Well, you know, that's the law now. That was the law under Trump and there were such surgeries then. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=290.0s)]
*  And these are not facts that Fox News tells its viewers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=296.0s)]
*  And so just to get that in, I thought it was really significant. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=300.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it showed a toughness. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=303.0s)]
*  And I think you're right. There's value here about about going in there and saying those things. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=305.0s)]
*  And even if she's not, you know, she's not some sort of inarticulate dummy who you can't. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=310.0s)]
*  She's not Donald Trump's session. She's not soft. That's for sure. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=315.0s)]
*  You [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5epGYKukz8&t=326.0s)]
