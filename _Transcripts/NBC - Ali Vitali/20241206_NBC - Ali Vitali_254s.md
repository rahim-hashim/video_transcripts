# Race for Democratic National Committee chair heats up
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s)
*  The race for Democratic National Committee Chair is really heating up. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=0.0s)]
*  Five Democrats have announced their bids, but according to The Hill, State Party Chair [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=4.0s)]
*  Ken Martin of Minnesota appears to have consolidated quite a bit of support, receiving at least [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=8.28s)]
*  100 endorsements from the 448 DNC members. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=13.44s)]
*  That is nearly half of the 225 votes needed to win the majority. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=17.86s)]
*  But State Party Chair Ben Wickler of Wisconsin has also received a handful of notable endorsements, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=22.92s)]
*  including from the center-left think tank Third Way and the Progressive Change Campaign [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=29.28s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=35.32s)]
*  That's quite a broad spectrum. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=36.32s)]
*  This is the first time since 2017 that Democrats have seen an open race for the DNC chair. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=37.32s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester, who has been [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  covering this race. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  It's not a post that receives a lot of national attention outside of election years, but so [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=50.24s)]
*  vitally important, particularly now for Democrats coming off such a disappointing show of power. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=54.96s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time, and it's a race that's been going on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=59.24s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=63.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time, and it's a race that's been going on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=64.92s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=67.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=68.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=69.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=70.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=71.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=72.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=73.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=74.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=75.92s)]
*  It's a race that's been going on for a long time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=76.92s)]
*  Look, the endorsements, I think, are big here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=107.92s)]
*  You have Ken Martin seemingly consolidating a lot of support from DNC members, but at [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=110.56s)]
*  the same time, Jonathan, I've chatted with a number of members who have said they're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=115.28s)]
*  still taking their time getting to know all these candidates. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=119.34s)]
*  And I think it is notable, as you noted earlier in the segment, that someone like Ben Wickler [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  has been able to get the backing of Third Way, a centrist, a center-left group, and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=128.04s)]
*  And then the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, in addition to the executive director of MoveOn.org, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=134.48s)]
*  that shows that that's a pretty broad tent, a pretty wide spectrum that Wickler is consolidating [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=140.2s)]
*  support from. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=144.72s)]
*  So you've got some reporting that shares that some in the party, including the Democratic [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=145.72s)]
*  Party out in Nevada, is calling on leaders to elevate diverse and working-class background [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=151.64s)]
*  states, trying to change a little bit how they approach this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, Alice, give us their reasoning as to why they focus on those states. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=160.14s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=163.54s)]
*  When you look at this field of DNC chairs, and, you know, I will say that statement, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=165.14s)]
*  the memo, I should say, that was put out by the Democratic Party of Nevada, it was not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=170.26s)]
*  directly about the DNC chairs. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  They're talking about elevating states. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=177.27999999999997s)]
*  But we look at the background of these four chairs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=179.06s)]
*  They come from either the East Coast or Midwestern states. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=182.94s)]
*  like Nevada, who are saying, look, we need to focus on working states with a strong working [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=187.3s)]
*  class or a vibrant working class, large working class. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  And of course, states that are diverse have, you know, large numbers of people of color. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=197.62s)]
*  We know that former President Trump, or President-elect Trump now, was able to make inroads with, you [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=203.58s)]
*  know, both of those groups. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=208.58s)]
*  So you have the Democratic Party of Nevada really pushing for that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  I think it is notable that when you look at this spectrum of candidates for the DNC chair, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  they all are white men, and they come from two portions, you know, the Midwest and the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=220.82s)]
*  East Coast. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see if there's any pushback there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  We haven't heard any yet. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=228.32s)]
*  But Nevada and some other states not wanting the DNC to forget that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SPs7vQ22s&t=229.61999999999998s)]
