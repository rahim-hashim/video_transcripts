# Trump Refuses To Condemn QAnon Conspiracy Theory | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ)
*  Welcome back to way too early. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It is 5 30 here on the East Coast and 2 30 out west. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=2.92s)]
*  I'm Casey Hunt. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=6.2s)]
*  We're going to start with another part of the president's Trump president's town hall [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=7.2s)]
*  that is making headlines this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  This concerns his penchant for spreading and in the case of Q Anon refusing to condemn [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=14.26s)]
*  conspiracy theories. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=19.92s)]
*  Watch now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=21.56s)]
*  Can you just once and for all state that that is completely not true? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=23.04s)]
*  Disavow Q Anon in its entirety. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=28.96s)]
*  I know nothing about Q Anon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=31.92s)]
*  I just told you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=34.0s)]
*  I know very little. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=35.0s)]
*  You told me but what you tell me doesn't necessarily make it fact. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=36.0s)]
*  I hate to say that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  I know nothing about it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=40.2s)]
*  I do know they are very much against pedophilia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=41.68s)]
*  They fight it very hard but I know nothing about it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=46.160000000000004s)]
*  They believe it is a satanic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  If you'd like me to. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  I'll tell you what I do know about. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  I know about Antifa and I know about the radical left. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=54.28s)]
*  Just this week you retweeted to your 87 million followers a conspiracy theory that Joe Biden [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=59.4s)]
*  orchestrated to have SEAL Team 6, the Navy SEAL Team 6 killed to cover up the fake death [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=65.04s)]
*  of Bin Laden. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=71.0s)]
*  Now why would you send a lie like that to your followers? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=72.0s)]
*  You retweeted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=74.72s)]
*  That was a retweet. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=75.72s)]
*  That was an opinion of somebody and that was a retweet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=76.84s)]
*  I'll put it out there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=80.88s)]
*  People can decide for themselves. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=81.88s)]
*  You're not like someone's crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=82.88s)]
*  That was a retweet and I do a lot of retweets. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=87.36s)]
*  You are not someone's crazy uncle who can just retweet whatever. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=91.88s)]
*  Savannah Guthrie saying what I think a lot of us are thinking when we look at the president's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Twitter feed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  We're going to ask former Republican Congressman Carlos Cribello of Florida about this very [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  topic. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  Sir, welcome. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  It's always great to see you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for getting up early. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  Let me just ask you to respond to that, that exchange that we, that we just saw the president [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=109.82s)]
*  essentially saying it's fine if I retweet these conspiracy theories. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=115.86s)]
*  It doesn't say anything. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  Retweets are not endorsements. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=120.5s)]
*  What kind of example does that set for people? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=122.02s)]
*  Casey, good morning. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  That's just standard Donald Trump and kudos for Savannah Guthrie for confronting him, for [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  really holding him accountable and making him explain why he would spread this kind [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=130.98s)]
*  of misinformation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  In the bottom line, Casey, is that the president is willing to do whatever it takes to win. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=137.52s)]
*  So these people who are propagating this fake theory, this conspiracy theory, the president [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  will at least tacitly endorse them because they are supporters of his and he will not [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=149.62s)]
*  condemn them or disavow them publicly because he doesn't want to do anything that will deflate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=154.4s)]
*  or diminish their support for him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=160.28000000000003s)]
*  He needs these people to turn out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=162.08s)]
*  So here's just another example where the president abandons the truth, endorses a lie, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=163.72s)]
*  uses a tiny little element that he can hold on to by saying, well, but they oppose pedophilia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=170.92s)]
*  So that means that everything else they do is perfectly fine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=176.76s)]
*  He holds onto that so that he can be in communion with this group, get their support and hopefully [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=179.74s)]
*  remain in power, which is all he clearly cares about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=187.76s)]
*  Yeah, we should, we should just remind everyone what this QAnon, like just how crazy this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=191.88s)]
*  QAnon conspiracy is. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  It says that there are Democrats who are part of a satanic death cult that kidnapped children [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=198.7s)]
*  and trafficked them and that President Trump is secretly at war against them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=203.6s)]
*  None of it, none of it at all is true. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=207.72s)]
*  And Congressman, what's your take on, I mean, you obviously lost your seat in the last midterm [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=210.16s)]
*  elections. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=216.6s)]
*  Republicans are facing a smaller but still potentially significant loss of more seats [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=217.6s)]
*  in the House. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=222.88s)]
*  The Senate also likely to lose Republican seats. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=224.0s)]
*  As you know too well, the upshot of that is that we're going to lose some of the more [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  moderate Republican voices, more of the moderate Republican voices in Congress. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Does this mean that the Republican Party is going to turn into that what we just saw, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=237.32s)]
*  QAnon? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=241.16s)]
*  I mean, we have a couple of QAnon supporters who are winding their way toward Congress. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=242.16s)]
*  Is that the future for the party, even if it's a post-Trump world? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, Casey, this is an important question. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=249.76s)]
*  And for sure, once Donald Trump is no longer president and therefore no longer head of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  the Republican Party, there's going to be a massive vacuum of power and leadership in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=259.12s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=265.08s)]
*  And who fills that vacuum is going to determine the future of the party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=266.2s)]
*  Is it going to be people like Ben Sasse, who is now embracing the truth? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=270.86s)]
*  And we welcome that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=276.18s)]
*  I wish he would have been more consistent about that over the years. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=277.18s)]
*  But certainly it's never too late to say what's true and to level with the American people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=280.86s)]
*  or with his constituents. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=287.82s)]
*  That's the big question. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=289.98s)]
*  Who's going to fill the vacuum? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=290.98s)]
*  Or are we going to get Trump copycats, which is a possibility? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  My opinion is that the more responsible voices, the more moderate voices are likely to fill [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=296.54s)]
*  the vacuum because that's where the American people are. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  That's where rising generations of Americans are. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  There's just not a long-term market for Donald Trump's style or his ideas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=309.38s)]
*  So for the good of the country, I really hope that the Republican Party takes a different [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=314.22s)]
*  course beginning on November 4th. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=318.66s)]
*  I mean, do you think that anyone who would want to come next would have to be that kind [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=322.02s)]
*  of celebrity? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=326.02s)]
*  I mean, does Donald Trump basically get special dispensation for that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=327.02s)]
*  Or is it possible somebody else could pop up and have that kind of celebrity? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=329.82s)]
*  Casey, whatever you think about Donald Trump, he's certainly unique. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=333.82s)]
*  He's one of a kind. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=337.5s)]
*  There aren't a bunch of Donald Trumps out there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=338.62s)]
*  But the American people conducted this experiment. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=341.85999999999996s)]
*  46% of them voted for the president. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=345.78s)]
*  He won fair and square in 2016. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=347.85999999999996s)]
*  And now it appears that the American people are choosing the exact opposite. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=351.58s)]
*  I've always said that Donald Trump's tried to demonize Joe Biden. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=357.17999999999995s)]
*  It's been very difficult for him because Joe Biden is vanilla. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  He's a traditional American politician. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=363.5s)]
*  And it appears that most Americans think that's the way the country should go. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=366.96s)]
*  So I don't think there will be pressure for another celebrity Republican politician to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=371.86s)]
*  emerge ahead of 2024, let's say. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=377.5s)]
*  I mean, one theme of this election is definitely that people seem to be rather tired of the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=382.26000000000005s)]
*  constant drama. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=386.42s)]
*  Former Congressman Carlos Curbelo, thank you very much, sir, for getting up with us. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=387.74s)]
*  I really appreciate it and I hope to see you again soon. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  Still ahead here with 18 days until the November election, we'll break down the state of the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=394.14000000000004s)]
*  2020 race with new polling across the country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=398.34000000000003s)]
*  Plus, Jimmy Kimmel's take on last night's dueling town halls. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=401.14s)]
*  Way too early. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=404.78s)]
*  Back in just a moment. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS1zQfsJxTQ&t=405.78s)]
