# Recent polls show Haley overtaking DeSantis
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A)
*  A pair of new polls show that former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina Governor Nikki [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=0.0s)]
*  Haley has eclipsed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for second place in the 2024 Republican primary. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=4.96s)]
*  The first poll from Suffolk University, USA Today and the Boston Globe, 49% of likely [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=12.6s)]
*  primary voters in New Hampshire say that Donald Trump is their choice to lead the ticket. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=18.18s)]
*  But for the first time, second place is not held by DeSantis, but rather Haley. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=23.0s)]
*  She's at 19%. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=27.2s)]
*  The Florida governor sits in third with 10% of the vote. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=28.68s)]
*  All of the other candidates, including Chris Christie, who has put everything on New Hampshire, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=31.84s)]
*  are just in single digits. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=35.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, in a Winthrop College poll of South Carolina Republicans, Haley earned 17% of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=37.32s)]
*  the vote there. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=43.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, that is still well behind Trump, who's at 51%, but she's now five points [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=44.0s)]
*  ahead of DeSantis, who's at 12. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Haley previously served as mentioned as the governor of that state. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  One of the state's current senators, Tim Scott, is at 6%, a very low number, but good enough [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=55.52s)]
*  for fourth place. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=61.24s)]
*  DeSantis is heading to Iowa while facing a critical cash crunch. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=62.88s)]
*  Yesterday, his campaign announced $15 million in third quarter fundraising and plans to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=67.28s)]
*  move roughly a third of its staff to Iowa, part of a plan to focus on the first in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  country GOP caucus. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=77.36s)]
*  It's all in the Hawkeye state. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=79.0s)]
*  While campaign aides for the Florida governor are selling this as part of a comeback, DeSantis [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=81.16s)]
*  actually could only use $5 million of that total in the primary push, an amount that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=85.72s)]
*  many political experts say just isn't enough. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=91.36s)]
*  And moving staff to Iowa instead of hiring locally, something that was typically done [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=94.36s)]
*  in past presidential campaigns, as a last ditch cost-saving effort, the experts believe, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=98.64s)]
*  DeSantis promised to visit all 99 counties in Iowa before the 2024 GOP caucuses, which [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=104.72s)]
*  are set for January 15th. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=110.56s)]
*  He trails Trump in Iowa by more than 30 points in a number of polls released just last month. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=112.4s)]
*  Joining us now, national political reporter for Politico, our friend, Natalie Allison. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=118.76s)]
*  Natalie, give us your assessment right now of the state of DeSantis. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=124.04s)]
*  We just ran through some pretty underwhelming polling numbers, a mediocre debate performance, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=128.0s)]
*  and now these reports of money and staffing problems. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=135.12s)]
*  Is there any sense from inside the DeSantis campaign, besides the spin, that they can [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=139.04s)]
*  turn this around? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=143.04s)]
*  Well, this is certainly not the position that DeSantis or his team ever wanted to be in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=144.04s)]
*  at this stage of the race. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  It's a candidate who for months was the only one who was able to tout that he was anything [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=151.0s)]
*  close to striking distance to Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=155.76s)]
*  He was the only one, he said, pulling in the double digits for many months when he had [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=157.68s)]
*  a field behind him of candidates who were all lagging in the low single digits. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  And now that's just no longer the case. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=167.0s)]
*  These polls are coming after a summer where he has campaigned relentlessly. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=170.28s)]
*  And I will add, he was doing that in Iowa. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, to his campaign's point, they are just going all in on Iowa right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  And certainly that gives them potentially a leg up when it comes caucus time in January, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  when potentially they are able to mobilize way more Iowans out to the caucus sites on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  that cold day. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  But it also runs the risk of letting someone like Nikki Haley gain a lot of ground in a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=196.88s)]
*  place like New Hampshire or in her home state of South Carolina that regardless of his performance [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  in Iowa, he may not be able to make up. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=205.48s)]
*  So is there a sense among the never Trump Republicans that they should coalesce around [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=208.28s)]
*  Haley right now? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=213.2s)]
*  Well, Haley is the latest donor darling. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=214.44s)]
*  They've cycled through. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=217.48s)]
*  It was, you know, at one point it was DeSantis. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=218.48s)]
*  And then of course they were looking at Tim Scott as the latest shiny object. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  And then now it's really Nikki Haley. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=223.44s)]
*  And we'll see how long this lasts, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  We'll see if she continues to eclipse DeSantis in polling. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=228.6s)]
*  Is this a blip? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=232.48s)]
*  Is this a moment in time? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=233.48s)]
*  Or is Nikki Haley going to consistently surpass her as the candidate who's running closest [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=234.68s)]
*  to Trump? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=240.44s)]
*  And so far those donors have held back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=241.44s)]
*  They didn't give to DeSantis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=244.32s)]
*  They didn't give to Tim Scott. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=245.88s)]
*  And we'll see after the latest third quarter fundraising reports to whether, you know, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  sometime in September they started writing checks for Nikki Haley. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  But so far a lot of these big dollar donors on the Republican side are just sitting on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  the sidelines. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=262.36s)]
*  And you know, Haley got a lift from those two debates, but she's still well, well behind [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=264.12s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=269.24s)]
*  And speaking of debates, you have a new piece out this morning that I've been waiting for [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=270.24s)]
*  someone to write. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=272.7s)]
*  You crushed it about how some RNC officials are wondering whether they should even still [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=273.7s)]
*  have these debates going forward considering the state of the polls and the fact that Trump [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  continues to skip them and is showing no inclination to ever show up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=281.64s)]
*  Tell us more about what you're hearing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=285.08s)]
*  Are these debates going to continue? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=286.08s)]
*  Well as of now, the RNC has a third debate scheduled for Miami early next month, but [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=288.44s)]
*  it's really unclear after that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=293.12s)]
*  They say that yes, they're going to continue these debates as long as there are a field [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  of candidates who are meeting their criteria to get on the stage, candidates who are raising [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=298.7s)]
*  money who are out there campaigning. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=302.96s)]
*  They say that they're going to have them, but they're in a really tricky position. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=305.28s)]
*  They scheduled these debates and the frontrunner said he wasn't going to bother to show up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=309.0s)]
*  And that's led to declining viewership. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=312.67999999999995s)]
*  Republican voters and independent voters and the people that ideally should be watching [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  these just really aren't tuning in like they were in 2015 at this same point in time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  It's leading to frustration among some of the RNC members even saying, why are we even [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=325.0s)]
*  bothering doing this if we can't get the frontrunner on stage? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  What is the point in doing these debates? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  We have a field of people on the stage who in many cases are pulling in the low single [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=334.6s)]
*  digits nationally. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=339.36s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  And so I think it's going to take some reflection on the part of the RNC to figure out is there [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=341.72s)]
*  a way we can get people more engaged? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  Is there a way we can get Trump on that stage? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=348.94s)]
*  But right now they've really abandoned their efforts to try to get Trump to show up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=351.6s)]
*  They tried that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, an important story. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  I think this is going to be a major topic of conversation in the weeks ahead. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=360.6s)]
*  You know, political reporter for Politico, Natalie Allison. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=364.16s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBPWwkEwd2A&t=366.52000000000004s)]
