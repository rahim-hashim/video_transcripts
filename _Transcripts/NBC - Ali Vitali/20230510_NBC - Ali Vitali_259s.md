# No progress made on debt limit after Tuesday meeting
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU)

*  leaders who will return to the White House on Friday after their first [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=2.98s)]
*  meeting with President Biden on the debt ceiling ended yesterday with [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=6.68s)]
*  apparently no significant developments. For now, staffers for both sides will [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=10.16s)]
*  continue meeting ahead of Friday's second session. However, two sources [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  familiar with yesterday's meeting telling BC News that House Speaker [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=19.18s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy was quote rude and disrespectful. They say McCarthy told [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=22.12s)]
*  Biden he was pushing a lie about veterans funding in a potential [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=26.36s)]
*  default situation. Take a look at what both men had to say after the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  meeting. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  I know the speaker says, well, I'm not, he uses the L word, a lying word, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=37.16s)]
*  but says I'm not telling the truth. All I asked him inside was if you're [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=41.96s)]
*  not going to cut any of those programs and you're saying the cut is 22% [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=47.32s)]
*  across the board, then you're gonna have to cut a hell of a lot more when [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=52.8s)]
*  the programs are left. No, we're not gonna do that either. I'm not sure. I [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=55.62s)]
*  don't think they're sure exactly what they're proposing. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=60.26s)]
*  I didn't call him a liar. I said, if you're saying we're cutting, that's a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=64.06s)]
*  lie. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=67.08s)]
*  I wouldn't call the president. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=69.56s)]
*  Members that he and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise were left fuming [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  after the White House meeting. Joining us now, co founder of Punch Bowl News, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=80.16s)]
*  Jake Sherman. He is an MSNBC political contributor and about the best in the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=84.5s)]
*  business when it comes to covering this. We're so glad he's here with us today. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=89.1s)]
*  So, Jake, give us your reporting. What is your analysis say about what we [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=92.74s)]
*  should read from yesterday's meeting? Is progress made or is this still at a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  deadlock? It's still at a deadlock. The good news is, Jonathan, that they're [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  gonna keep talking. The staff is gonna keep talking over the next few days. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=106.58s)]
*  Now, what they're talking about is not entirely clear to me. I tried to get [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  some answers on that last night. They think they're talking about different [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=113.82s)]
*  things. Democrats say they're talking about a a spending deal outside the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=117.22s)]
*  context of a debt limit. Republicans say they're talking about a spending deal [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=122.24s)]
*  that would ride alongside the debt limit. So it's not entirely clear what [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=126.82s)]
*  they're talking about. What is clear to me is that they have a couple weeks to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=129.94s)]
*  get this done, and it's gonna be very difficult in those few weeks to get it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=133.48s)]
*  done. They still have not gotten down to brass tacks here, and that's that's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  alarming if you don't want to see the nation default on its debt for the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=142.06s)]
*  first time in history. The president even left the door open yesterday to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=145.06s)]
*  skipping a scheduled foreign trip to the G seven if needed. If this wasn't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=148.98s)]
*  resolved, we'll have more on this when we speak to White House Deputy Press [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=153.22s)]
*  Secretary Olivia Dalton a little later in the show. But, Jake, we want to make [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=156.9s)]
*  sure we also got you on the George Santos indictment. Set aside the legal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=159.74s)]
*  matter. Let's just get you to weigh in on the politics of it. What can McCarthy [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=165.02s)]
*  do? What's the Republicans recourse here? We know just how slim their [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=168.94s)]
*  majority is in the house. They're not. He's not gonna do anything. He made [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=173.9s)]
*  that clear yesterday. He's gonna allow Santos to stay in the house. Now [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=177.5s)]
*  somebody, including a Democrat, could try to expel Santos. And I have to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=180.5s)]
*  imagine actually that that would probably pass. It would need a large [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  majority to do so. But listen, McCarthy is right in that there have been [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  indicted members who have served Jeff Fortenberry. Most recently, a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  Republican from Nebraska served until he was convicted. Bob Menendez, the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=197.5s)]
*  Senate, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was indicted on [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  bribery charges and continued to serve and was was acquitted is still in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  Congress. So there is precedent, John, and for serving and while you're under [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  indictment, Santos is, I would say a little bit different of a case [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  politically just because how bold and widespread his his dishonesty has been. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  But it's not unusual, unfortunately, for members of Congress to serve under [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  indictment. Co founder of Punchbowl News, Jake Sherman, we will be speaking [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=229.5s)]
*  to you again. I'm certain in the days ahead, so much going on there on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=234.34s)]
*  Capitol Hill still [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgecXHBh7QU&t=238.26000000000002s)]
