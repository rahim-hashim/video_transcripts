# Second Republican backs effort to oust Speaker Johnson
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo)
*  Back to politics now, House Speaker Mike Johnson says he plans to get the GOP-led foreign aid package on the floor by the end of the week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=0.0s)]
*  The four bills, which include aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and Indo-Pacific allies, are garnering some support, but things are still fluid. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=7.5s)]
*  Some far-right conservatives have voiced outright opposition to the measures, while rank-and-file Republicans are angry that the package does not address the southern border. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=16.5s)]
*  Johnson's saving grace could be Democrats. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=27.0s)]
*  The speaker spoke to President Biden yesterday, and congressional Democrats appear inclined to support the package as long as no Republican poison pills are included. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=31.0s)]
*  There's no option off the table right now, from procedural measures that bring this directly to the floor to any votes that are options. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=42.0s)]
*  If it delivers, as the vice chair said, if it delivers the four points that we are concerned about, then it should be something that is on the table. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=52.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, Johnson's move to push forward with the aid package might cost him his job. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=59.5s)]
*  Republican Congressman Thomas Massey has announced his support for Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to oust the speaker. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=65.5s)]
*  Massey said Johnson's actions on government funding, FISA, and foreign aid contributed to his decision. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=73.5s)]
*  Take a listen to what Massey said yesterday, followed by the speaker's thoughts on his current predicament. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=82.0s)]
*  Yes, I asked him to resign. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=89.0s)]
*  He said he would not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=91.0s)]
*  And then I said, well, you're the one who's going to put us into this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=93.0s)]
*  Because the motion is going to get called. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=96.0s)]
*  Okay, does anybody doubt that? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=98.0s)]
*  The motion will get called, and then he's going to lose more votes than Kevin McCarthy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=100.0s)]
*  And I have told him this in private, like, weeks ago. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=104.0s)]
*  I am not resigning, and it is, in my view, an absurd notion that someone would bring a vacate motion when we are simply here trying to do our jobs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=108.5s)]
*  We need steady leadership. We need steady hands at the wheel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=119.5s)]
*  Look, I regard myself as a wartime speaker that a couple days ago on his social media, that this is the hardest challenge that's faced a speaker probably in the history of the country, in the moment that we're in right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=123.5s)]
*  He said arguably, maybe comparable to the Civil War, but maybe worse. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=134.0s)]
*  Joining us now, co-founder of Punchball News, John Bresnahan. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=141.0s)]
*  John, I'm not sure it's worse than the Civil War, but we'll set that aside. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=145.0s)]
*  The Republican House of Representatives outdoing itself day after day. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=148.0s)]
*  Even more chaos and dysfunction. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=153.0s)]
*  We'll get to the threat on Johnson's job in a moment. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=156.0s)]
*  Let's start with the foreign aid package. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=159.0s)]
*  Give us a rundown of where things stand, these four different components, whether we think there'll be enough support, and walk us through its future with the Senate and White House, too. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=161.5s)]
*  Yeah, I stayed up late last night, even though we have a 4 a.m. newsletter, Punchball News. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=173.5s)]
*  I stayed up late to see if there would be a bill released. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=178.5s)]
*  It was, they're not ready. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=181.5s)]
*  They don't have a deal internally. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=183.5s)]
*  Johnson has not been able to reach a deal internally among Republicans where he feels comfortable that he can release a bill and still stay speaker. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=186.0s)]
*  So they're waiting on this today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=194.0s)]
*  If they release it today under the 72-hour rule Republicans have, there wouldn't be a vote until Saturday. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=196.0s)]
*  And at that point, it would go on to the Senate. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=203.0s)]
*  Senate has other stuff to deal with. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=205.0s)]
*  They have to deal with the Majorca's impeachment, to deal with reauthorizing FISA, the surveillance law. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=207.0s)]
*  They have a bunch of stuff on their plate as well. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=212.0s)]
*  Right now, there is no deal among Republicans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=214.5s)]
*  There's no bill. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=216.5s)]
*  There's no text of legislation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=217.5s)]
*  We haven't seen what Johnson's going to try. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=218.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=220.5s)]
*  So even though we haven't seen it, it's certainly sparking anger among some of the far right, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Congressman Massey in particular. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=221.5s)]
*  So give us a sense, first of all, just the reaction to what we heard from Massey yesterday. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=230.5s)]
*  How is that being received by others and Republicans, other Republicans? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=234.5s)]
*  And what's the momentum here? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=238.5s)]
*  Do we see this costing him his job? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=239.5s)]
*  You know, it could. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=242.0s)]
*  It very well could. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=243.0s)]
*  I mean, I was in one of those scrums with Massey yesterday when he was talking to reporters, and he's upset. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=244.0s)]
*  I mean, he feels like there's, and there's a number of hardline conservatives feel like you bring up the Pelosi comparison. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=249.0s)]
*  Like, there's no difference for them in the way they view things between Pelosi being speaker and Johnson being speaker. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=258.0s)]
*  It would be the same bill under either one, they feel like. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=265.0s)]
*  So why is Johnson speaker? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=267.0s)]
*  The other thing is, like, a lot of these hardliners, they really want, or a lot, there's a number of them that really want to have a fight with, you know, centrist, moderate Democrats, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=269.5s)]
*  RINOs, Republicans, a name only that they call them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=281.5s)]
*  And even if it ends up in the minority, even if they end up losing their majority, they'd rather be pure on these issues than pass a bill, then govern. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=283.5s)]
*  So, you know, there is a lot of dissension inside the conference. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=294.0s)]
*  I don't know how many of these members will vote against Johnson. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=296.0s)]
*  And if Democrats keep Johnson in the Speaker's House, how is he as Speaker's Chair, how is he still viable? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=298.0s)]
*  You know, how can he go raise money saying, you know, with Democrats supporting him as Speaker? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=300.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a really, really difficult position that he's in right now. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=302.0s)]
*  Maybe not the Civil War bad, but pretty bad. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=304.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should keep that context in mind. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=306.0s)]
*  And then lastly, you got to have a lot of people that are going to vote for Johnson. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=308.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a really, really important thing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=310.0s)]
*  I think that's a really, really important thing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=312.0s)]
*  I think that's a really, really important thing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=314.0s)]
*  I think that's a really, really important thing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=316.0s)]
*  I think that's a really, really important thing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should keep that context in mind. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=320.5s)]
*  And then lastly, just walk us through his future there. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=322.5s)]
*  So either he's going to keep his job, but be mortally wounded perhaps, or if he is ousted, what happens next? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=324.5s)]
*  Or if he is ousted, what happens next? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=330.5s)]
*  Or if he is ousted, what happens next? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=332.5s)]
*  Is there another Republican that could step in? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=334.5s)]
*  Could we even be looking at, even just for a minute, a Speaker Jeffries? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=336.5s)]
*  No, there won't be a Speaker Jeffries. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=340.5s)]
*  I don't think there could be a Speaker pro tem, a Republican, like we had after McCarthy was forced out, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=342.5s)]
*  former speaker McCarthy was forced out in October for three weeks of chaos. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=347.5s)]
*  There was a speaker pro tem, there was a who couldn't move legislation except in emergency, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=353.5s)]
*  but the House was able to at least meet, but they couldn't pass anything. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=360.98s)]
*  It was such a traumatic experience for a lot of members on both sides of the aisle. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=364.78s)]
*  They may save Johnson. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=370.22s)]
*  I had a senior Democrat come up to me yesterday, said, I will get 25 votes for Johnson if I need to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=373.18s)]
*  in order to avoid what happened last year. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=381.18s)]
*  But again, I don't know if Johnson would accept it because he'd be a speaker, as you know, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=383.82000000000005s)]
*  he'd be a speaker name only. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=388.86s)]
*  So I think we'll have to see. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  I think today is really, really, really critical for Johnson. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=393.18s)]
*  If he drops a bill and the hardliners move forward to try to oust him, that vote could [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=396.62s)]
*  happen before the end of the week. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=400.86s)]
*  Dysfunction is putting it lightly. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=403.1s)]
*  Staying up late last night, getting up early this morning for the newsletter, which will [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=404.86s)]
*  be in your inbox soon. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I8isxzsXZo&t=408.14000000000004s)]
