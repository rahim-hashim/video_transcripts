# Shootings take emotional toll on U.S. school system
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU)
*  I have done the full extent of my executive authority to do on my own anything about guns. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=0.0s)]
*  Congress has to act. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=8.16s)]
*  The majority of the American people think having assault weapons is bizarre. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=10.16s)]
*  It's crazy ideas. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=15.16s)]
*  We're against that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=17.16s)]
*  Welcome back to Wait Too Early. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=19.16s)]
*  It's 531 on the East Coast, 231 out West. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=21.16s)]
*  I'm Jon Flamir and that was President Joe Biden yesterday calling on Congress to take [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=24.16s)]
*  action to pass meaningful new restrictions on guns. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=28.32s)]
*  His statement that most Americans support an assault weapons ban is absolutely backed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=31.32s)]
*  up by recent polling, especially when it comes to young people. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=35.32s)]
*  In a survey taken earlier this month by the Harvard Institute of Politics, and that's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=38.32s)]
*  before Monday's shooting in Nashville, 58% of 18 to 29-year-olds said they were in favor [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=43.32s)]
*  of banning assault weapons. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=48.32s)]
*  29%, meanwhile, said they were against the idea. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=50.32s)]
*  Overall, 63% of young Americans expressed support for stricter gun laws, while 13% thought [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=53.48s)]
*  the laws should be less strict. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Those numbers were essentially unchanged from a 2018 poll taken in the aftermath of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  Parkland shooting in Florida. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=68.48s)]
*  Joining us now, President of the American Federation of Teachers, Randy Weingarten. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=71.48s)]
*  Randy, thank you for joining us this morning from the discussions that you've had recent [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=76.48s)]
*  days, but frankly, in the months and years past, with students, parents and teachers, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=80.64s)]
*  just how damaging has this epidemic of mass shootings, epidemic of mass shootings been [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=87.64s)]
*  on the education system of the United States of America? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=92.64s)]
*  So first, Jonathan, thank you for having me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=96.64s)]
*  I love the name of your show. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=101.64s)]
*  I've been giggling about it all morning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=104.64s)]
*  Look, every—I think what Yuvaldi and now the tragic Nashville shooting did, and I hear [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=107.8s)]
*  it from parents and from teachers all the time, people now wonder whether this is normalized. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=118.8s)]
*  Already, gun violence is the largest, biggest killer of youth, the largest, the biggest. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=126.8s)]
*  And with these mass shootings, what's happening is that people are no longer thinking that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=136.96s)]
*  schools will be that safe zone that they need for their kids. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=148.96s)]
*  And kids themselves are furious about this because there are ways of solving it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=155.96s)]
*  And I think that Joe Biden is right, and you can see it from the evidence that when we [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=164.12s)]
*  had an assault weapons ban, we had far fewer mass shootings. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=170.12s)]
*  And the, you know, countries like Australia and New Zealand, who have solved this, Scotland [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=177.12s)]
*  has solved this, we can solve it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=185.12s)]
*  You look at these charts, we're off the charts in terms of mass shootings and other democracies [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=188.12s)]
*  of the world are not. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=193.28s)]
*  So the question becomes why assault weapons have more rights in the United States of America [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  than children. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  And then the other piece is, on top of this, is think about what these same people who [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=208.08s)]
*  don't want to ban assault weapons are saying. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  They're going to ban books about ruby bridges, movies about ruby bridges. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=216.8s)]
*  Mobile Alabama is banning a book about Harry Potter. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=221.68s)]
*  So we're banning books that will help kids actually be critical thinkers and know knowledge. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=224.68s)]
*  And in this era of AI, GBT, you know, we need that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=233.68s)]
*  But we're going to ban books, but we're not going to ban assault weapons. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=238.68s)]
*  And Randy, certainly, I spoke to my own children last night about the shooting. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=242.68s)]
*  Kids across the country have lockdown drills every day, it seems. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=245.68s)]
*  And on your other point, you addressed the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., yesterday [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=249.96s)]
*  about that different type of danger that schools face. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=253.16s)]
*  Give us a sense as to what that is and what's being done, what should be done to address [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=259.36s)]
*  So what I did yesterday, Jonathan, was I went right for solutions. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=260.92s)]
*  I knew I had to tell the story of what's going on in America right now, which is that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=265.08s)]
*  you got, you know, you essentially have two Americas right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=270.24s)]
*  And there's one America that is trying to actually say, how do we deal with learning [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=273.76s)]
*  loss? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=279.8s)]
*  How do we deal with this youth mental health crisis? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=280.8s)]
*  How do we deal with the effects not only of COVID, but of poverty, economic insecurity? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=282.2s)]
*  And that's what I drilled down on, the kind of four things that I think, if we brought [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  them to scale, we'd turn around education in this country and, you know, really make [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=292.12s)]
*  every public school a place parents want to send their kids, educators want to work and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=297.7s)]
*  kids thrive. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=301.2s)]
*  And those are, you know, experiential learning, which we do now with CTE, expanding community [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=302.2s)]
*  schools, wrapping services around making schools centers of community, really deepening parent-teacher [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  connections and obviously addressing the teacher shortage. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  The other America, and DeSantis does this all the time, is widening the gap. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=320.04s)]
*  They want the division. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=325.88000000000005s)]
*  They defund schools. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=327.6s)]
*  DeSantis just defunded schools by $4 billion this week. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you think that's going to do in terms of school security? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=334.16s)]
*  So that's what I talked about, that book banning, that dividing, that defunding versus [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=337.48s)]
*  what we really need to do to address learning loss and the mental health crisis. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=341.98s)]
*  It's such an important conversation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=346.26000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for sharing some with us this morning, and we will stay on this, of course. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=348.42s)]
*  President of the American Federation of Teachers, Randy Weingarten, thank you again for being [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  with us today. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKt_iaaFyvU&t=355.34000000000003s)]
