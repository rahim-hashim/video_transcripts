# Nikki Haley 'inclined in favor of a pardon' for Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944)
*  Welcome back. Nikki Haley is taking a softer stance on former President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=0.0s)]
*  indictment. A flip-flop if you will. On Monday Haley called Trump reckless for [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=5.96s)]
*  keeping classified documents in his home saying if the allegations are true he [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=10.8s)]
*  quote put all of our military men and women in danger. In a radio interview [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=15.68s)]
*  yesterday Haley doubled down on that comment but then added that she'd also [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=20.92s)]
*  consider a pardon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=25.28s)]
*  What's happening is unfortunate. I think the Justice Department has handled this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=30.04s)]
*  whole thing terribly. I mean you can't have one standard for Democrats like [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=34.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and then another standard for Republicans like [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=38.2s)]
*  Donald Trump and we're seeing that again and we're seeing that again with the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=41.64s)]
*  Biden robbery recordings that have come to light. I mean the country should [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=45.24s)]
*  never stand for that and I think that we should all speak up and we have to be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=50.16s)]
*  loud about that. Having said that if the claims and the indictment are true, if [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=53.68s)]
*  they're true, then Trump was incredibly reckless with our national security and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=58.68s)]
*  that's not okay. So now if you've got the question of a pardon, I mean that's a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=63.24s)]
*  very different question. I'm not going to presume President Trump's guilt. I think [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=68.72s)]
*  we all need to let this trial play out. We need to see you know exactly what [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=72.92s)]
*  happens but you know when you look at a pardon the issue is less about guilt and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  more about what's good for the country and I think it would be terrible for the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=81.4s)]
*  country to have a former president in prison for years because of a documents [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=85.52s)]
*  case. That's something you see in a third world country. I saw that at the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=88.92s)]
*  United Nations so I would be inclined in favor of a pardon. To recap, Haley's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=92.92s)]
*  initial reaction to the indictment last week was to discredit the case. Writing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  on Twitter, this is not how justice should be pursued in our country. Then [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=102.8s)]
*  she came out strongly against Trump. Now, hey, maybe a pardon. Joining us now, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  political reporter for Axios, Alexi McCamond. Alexi, great to see you this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=111.04s)]
*  morning. So let's talk about this balancing act that Republicans are trying [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=116.36000000000001s)]
*  to walk here. This case is a pretty obvious flip-flop but others are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=121.2s)]
*  sort of suggesting okay maybe Trump did something wrong but you know it's still [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  the Biden Department of Justice with their overreach. How are they trying to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=130.6s)]
*  calculate this as they try to win Trump supporters? I mean it's like they're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  applying to an audience of one which is former President Donald Trump. Of course [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=139.0s)]
*  his supporters support him in the way he talks about it but I feel like you'd [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=142.56s)]
*  think the same. The supporters who like Trump and like what he's saying about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=146.72s)]
*  this indictment aren't looking to someone else to some alternative to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=150.0s)]
*  defend him. They're fighting and writing with Trump and for Trump and when someone [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=152.92s)]
*  says something like oh this is the weaponization of the DOJ or the DOJ is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=157.24s)]
*  corrupt against Trump they're not really articulating to voters how that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=161.4s)]
*  will help them, how the DOJ is supposedly weaponized against them, how [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=165.48s)]
*  this will improve their future and yet candidates are like Ron DeSantis and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=170.0s)]
*  others proposing things to completely gut and overhaul and move the DOJ, the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  FBI, the CIA. They're parroting Trump's talking points but not getting any of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=179.72s)]
*  political benefit because they you know flip-flop and come up with all these [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  jumbled statements that in the end when you read them closely don't actually [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=189.0s)]
*  make a lot of sense. No, a lot of word salad. So there's also the idea of pardons [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=191.92s)]
*  have been injected into this like it's become a litmus test. Hey would you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  pardon Donald Trump if he's convicted? Vivek Ramasway is sort of at the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=198.44s)]
*  forefront but it's an interesting calculation. Tell us what you think [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  Republicans are doing. Yeah and one Republican strategist said the other day [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  privately like you know Trump's best bet now is to basically step down and try to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  get a pledge from the other candidates to pardon him which obviously he's not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=214.16s)]
*  going to do and they're probably not going to engage but you're seeing more [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=217.6s)]
*  and more folks Haley, Vivek as you mentioned saying well if elected [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=221.28s)]
*  president I will pardon him and and that's so interesting because they're [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=225.36s)]
*  already jumping to the idea that he would be convicted of this crime and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=228.9s)]
*  that they would be elected president and to what I just said they would use the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=232.64s)]
*  powers of the presidency to vindicate President Trump, overhaul the DOJ and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=236.96s)]
*  continue this narrative that the entire justice system is weaponized against [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=241.24s)]
*  Republicans. A couple Republicans have said to me they think Trump's support this time around [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=245.08s)]
*  maybe a little softer than it has been other times and that some Trump [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=248.04s)]
*  supporters might be willing to explore another candidate just if they think [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=251.64s)]
*  like Trump can't win again perhaps but in order for Republicans to pull those [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=255.16s)]
*  supporters they have to kind of be nice to Trump while they do it because those [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=258.52s)]
*  Trump supporters simply won't stand for it if you're really attacking him. So we [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=261.92s)]
*  just did focus groups last night in North Carolina actually and we talked [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=266.24s)]
*  to voters about the different Republican primary candidates responses to sort of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=269.92s)]
*  see like do they like the people who are pro-Trump you know saying it's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=274.12s)]
*  weaponized or do they like the people who are sort of threading threading the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=278.0s)]
*  needle while still being respectful of Trump. Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Aysa [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=280.92s)]
*  Hutchinson, Chris Christie, those folks who didn't directly attack Trump's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=286.64s)]
*  character but still said you know this is a bad look for the country or we need [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=291.48s)]
*  to follow the facts. People in those focus groups seem to gravitate more [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=296.2s)]
*  toward that because they liked that it was still respectful toward Trump and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=300.64s)]
*  not attacking him but still saying look something is up here and this isn't okay [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=304.24s)]
*  and just because this Republican is this way doesn't mean we're all that way and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  that was an interesting message. Yeah that's gonna be that's gonna be a trend [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=313.0s)]
*  to follow here as these indictments potentially pile up. Political reporter [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=315.76s)]
*  for Axios, Alexa McKinnon, thank you as always great to see you here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toe5J3xM944&t=319.59999999999997s)]
