# Trump allies in Florida rally to flip lawmakers that endorsed DeSantis
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM)
*  NBC News has some exclusive reporting this morning that allies of Donald Trump in Florida [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=0.0s)]
*  are trying to flip state Republican lawmakers who previously endorsed Governor DeSantis [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=5.12s)]
*  and try to bring them over to team Trump. Two sources familiar with the effort tell NBC News [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=10.32s)]
*  as many as six Florida GOP lawmakers could announce their switch to Trump as early as next week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  A Florida Republican lobbyist who has heard about the effort but isn't involved said he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=21.28s)]
*  expects at least five more to move to the former president. The move is scheduled to coincide [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=25.6s)]
*  with the Florida Freedom Summit on Saturday which will feature all of the major Republican [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=29.92s)]
*  presidential candidates. DeSantis will be speaking midday Saturday at the summit while Trump secured [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=35.2s)]
*  the premier slot as the event's keynote speaker. In addition to the summit, the third Republican [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=41.84s)]
*  presidential debate hosted by NBC News is being held in the state of Florida, Miami, next Wednesday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  Trump is, of course, skipping the debate as he did the first two and will hold a counter-programming [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=53.6s)]
*  event nearby. Joining us now, national political reporter for Politico, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Elanish Snyder. Elanish, great to see you this morning. So let's start with DeSantis. This is a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=64.32s)]
*  bit of a, well, a humbling moment here. This is his state, a state where he has, until recently [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=69.52s)]
*  anyway, enjoyed pretty high poll numbers. He is definitely second fiddle in this event this weekend [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=74.48s)]
*  and now there's this effort for team Trump to try to steal some of his supporters. Give us your [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=81.44s)]
*  thoughts in the Republicans you've spoken to about how important this next week or so, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=87.04s)]
*  including that debate, is for Governor DeSantis. Well, look, we're starting to see the Republican [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  presidential field start to winnow. Mike Pence, of course, just recently dropped out of the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  presidential campaign. There is an effort underway to try and consolidate a bit as to who is running [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  in this primary and this is just obviously another attempt by team Trump to try and put pressure [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=107.84s)]
*  on Ron DeSantis to show that even though Florida is his home state, the story of Florida, how he's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  been able to win there is such a key part of his own presidential bid that he doesn't actually have [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=119.28s)]
*  the near unanimous support that he talks about on the campaign trail and instead there are these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=125.83999999999999s)]
*  state lawmakers who may actually end up flipping from supporting DeSantis to Trump as a sign of how [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=129.84s)]
*  this primary is continuing to sort of focus and clarify as Trump has maintained this number one [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=136.4s)]
*  slot consistently throughout basically this entire year in public polling. So as the field [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=142.32s)]
*  begins to winnow, as you said, there are some who are opposed to Trump who say we need to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=148.56s)]
*  consolidate around someone and Nikki Haley seems to be the choice of the moment, but she's still [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  well, well behind Trump in national polls and battleground state polls. What are Republican [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=157.92s)]
*  operatives thinking? Does Haley have a shot here? Well, look, she is the only one who has seen real [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=163.76s)]
*  movement. She's the only candidate who's been able to build out a base from in this low single [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=168.96s)]
*  digits a couple of months ago to now hitting high single, you know, high double digits in places [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  like New Hampshire just recently on New Hampshire and South Carolina, two key early states. So she's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=178.96s)]
*  somebody who's at least seen some movement. And so that's part of her team's pitch as to why she [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=184.32s)]
*  should be the alternative to Donald Trump here because she's the only one who's really demonstrated [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=188.72s)]
*  the ability to grow her base. But at the end of the day, the consolidation around Trump has [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=193.12s)]
*  remained solid. And it's not clear that even if all of the other candidates were to drop out, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=198.72s)]
*  all of that support would go to Nikki Haley, that she would necessarily be able to ultimately [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=203.84s)]
*  beat Trump in a primary. So it's still an incredibly narrow path for anyone who is not named [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=208.16s)]
*  Donald Trump in this in this presidential primary right now. That can't be can't be said enough. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOYoaj6IiM&t=213.6s)]
