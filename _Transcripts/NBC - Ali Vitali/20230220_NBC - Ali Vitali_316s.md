# Biden makes surprise visit to Ukraine to mark one year after Russia's invasion
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k)
*  President Joe Biden is in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=0.0s)]
*  We can announce that he has made a secret trip to Kiev, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=3.4s)]
*  just days ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=6.8s)]
*  He had been scheduled to depart tonight from Washington to Poland. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=12.8s)]
*  He would give a speech marking the anniversary of the war and the US' commitment to Ukraine's cause. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=18.68s)]
*  But he made this trip days in advance. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=25.36s)]
*  We are seeing now brand new images of President Biden in Kiev with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=28.16s)]
*  The two presidents walked around downtown Kiev, images appearing on social media, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=36.76s)]
*  and then these here at Ukrainian government buildings. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=42.36s)]
*  The President of the United States, again, has made a secret trip to Kiev days ahead of the war. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=46.92s)]
*  This is his first trip there since the conflict began. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=53.44s)]
*  He was one of the last Western leaders to make this trip for obvious security reasons. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  That's why this trip was not announced until now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=61.76s)]
*  We are seeing images of the President of the United States in Poland, where he will be marking this President's Day. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=64.72s)]
*  And let's go now to NBC News correspondent Josh Liderman, who is in Warsaw, Poland, with more. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=70.96s)]
*  Josh, what can you tell us about this stunning trip? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=77.16s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, obviously, this has been a highly anticipated trip ever since the start of the war. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=83.64s)]
*  Reporters, as we and others have been asking for really a full year now, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  when President Biden was going to be able to make this symbolically important visit to Kiev. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=93.44s)]
*  Today, as we are just a few days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=99.6s)]
*  President Biden finally able to make that visit, leaving Washington under the cover of darkness. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  As you mentioned, he was not scheduled to leave until later, until this evening, and to arrive here in Poland. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  But obviously, any kind of a presidential visit like this to an active war zone has to be shrouded in complete secrecy. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=117.72s)]
*  But the importance of this from a symbolic point of view as we mark this one-year anniversary cannot be overstated. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=125.68s)]
*  If you think back to a year ago, Jonathan, when President Putin of Russia was predicting that Russia's military [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=133.2s)]
*  was going to be able to overtake the country of Ukraine in a matter of days, overtake the capital of Kiev, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=139.72s)]
*  which they set their sights on very early in the war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=145.32s)]
*  And here we are one year later. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=148.52s)]
*  Not only has that not happened, but the president of the United States, perhaps the most protected person on the planet, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=150.92s)]
*  is able to go to the middle of Ukraine, to the capital city, sit down in the presidential palace, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=157.88s)]
*  as you see in that photo on the screen with President Zelensky. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=164.44s)]
*  He's also been spotted walking around in downtown Kiev, where the streets have been blocked off for much of the day, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=168.2s)]
*  people kept inside amid all of this heightened security. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=175.8s)]
*  So we don't know exactly how long President Biden will be in the country. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=179.92s)]
*  Obviously, the White House keeping all of those details under wraps as they try to protect his security. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=183.76s)]
*  But, of course, this is a clear message that the president is hoping to send as he is on his way to Poland, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=190.6s)]
*  where he will then be meeting with other Ukraine allies as we mark this anniversary about the level of solidarity and unity [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=197.48s)]
*  among the Western countries that are supporting Ukraine. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=205.92s)]
*  This is a way for President Biden to say for all of the concerns that support for Ukraine was going to ebb as the economic toll [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=209.12s)]
*  mounted for Europe, for the United States, the inflation crisis, the energy crisis, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=218.16s)]
*  the cost of providing some 30 plus billion dollars in U.S. security assistance to Ukraine throughout the course of this war, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=222.72s)]
*  for all of the concerns that that was going to create fatigue and that Western allies were no longer going to have the same appetite for supporting Ukraine. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a clear attempt to show that that has not happened, that support today, as we near this anniversary, is even more solid than it has been ever before. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=239.52s)]
*  And we expect during the course of the president's visit here to Europe that he will be able to announce further steps from the U.S. to support Ukraine. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=250.4s)]
*  Our colleagues Courtney Kuby and Kara Lee have reported there may be additional U.S. economic assistance to Ukraine, potentially new announcements of military assistance. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=258.76s)]
*  All of that wrapped in the diplomatic symbolism of the president going right to the heart of Kiev, sitting down with President Zelensky in his own palace. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=268.6s)]
*  You can see the president looks very calm there. He looks like he could be in any world capital around the world. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=279.8s)]
*  But here he is in Kiev making the clear message that the U.S. will continue to be in this in the long haul in support of Ukraine as well as its other allies. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH7F_GJln3k&t=286.28000000000003s)]
