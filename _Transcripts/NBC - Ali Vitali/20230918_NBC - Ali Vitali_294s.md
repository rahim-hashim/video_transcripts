# House GOP agrees to deal that would fun government through October 31
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY)
*  Key groups within the House Republican Conference reached a tentative agreement last night to keep the government funded through October 31st. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=0.0s)]
*  The deal, which was made between the far-right House Freedom Caucus and the center-right Main Street Caucus, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=8.0s)]
*  includes a funding bill for the Department of Defense as well as a wish list of conservative demands, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=14.0s)]
*  multiple GOP sources with knowledge of the agreement said. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=21.0s)]
*  That includes pairing the bill with GOP-led immigration legislation from earlier this year [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=25.0s)]
*  that severely restricts access to asylum and includes calls to finish the wall at the southern border. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=30.0s)]
*  The Republican deal also calls for an 8% cut to domestic spending, with exceptions for military and veteran funding. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=38.0s)]
*  However, there is no mention of the bill at all of aid for Ukraine or disaster relief, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=45.0s)]
*  which have been sticking points for both parties as well as the White House. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=51.0s)]
*  While the bill still may pass the House this week, it is all but certain to die in the Democratic-led Senate, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=55.0s)]
*  which still leaves Congress without a permanent government funding solution. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=61.0s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had this to say regarding his conference yesterday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=66.0s)]
*  Joining us now, co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer. She is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=81.0s)]
*  Anna, great to see you this morning. So talk to us a little bit more about this deal, how it was reached, what's in it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=96.0s)]
*  But doesn't it also fly in the face of the spending agreement reached by McCarthy and the White House earlier this year? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=102.0s)]
*  Yeah, the devil's always in the details here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=109.0s)]
*  And we have been seeing the negotiations between the conservative faction of House Republicans [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=111.0s)]
*  and the more moderate Main Street Republicans going back and forth trading paper [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=116.0s)]
*  because of the fact that Speaker Kevin McCarthy and his plans basically were stymied last week by the more conservative members of his conference. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=121.0s)]
*  I think the big thing to think about here, though, is the fact that we are 13 days away from a government shutdown. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=130.0s)]
*  Even if this bill, this compromise bill that you kind of laid out, actually passes the House, which is a huge if, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=136.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy is going to have a very difficult time getting the votes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=143.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of members of his conference who've already said that they don't like this deal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=148.0s)]
*  There's a lot of members of the Freedom Caucus that have said they don't want to pass a short-term spending bill. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=152.0s)]
*  So even if he's successful there, this is a non-starter in the Senate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=157.0s)]
*  And so the big question is, are House Republicans just kind of wasting time here? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=162.0s)]
*  And are we just going to hurdle into a government shutdown at this point? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=170.0s)]
*  Betting odds would suggest that we might, because as you say, the House is no sure thing to pass this, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=172.0s)]
*  but it's almost definitely not going to get through the Senate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=177.0s)]
*  So where does that stand right now? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=180.0s)]
*  Talk to us about where the GOP leadership in the Senate, McConnell and his team, how are they viewing this? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=183.0s)]
*  What are they looking to do to keep the government lights open, which McConnell keeps saying he wants? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=188.0s)]
*  It's such a different dynamic than we saw in the debt limit deal, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=193.0s)]
*  Where you had Senate Republicans really taking a step back and allowing Kevin McCarthy to be that key negotiator [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=197.0s)]
*  with the White House and lead on these negotiations. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=204.0s)]
*  Right now you have Senate Republicans much more closely aligned with Democrats in the Senate and the White House, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=206.0s)]
*  particularly when it comes to Ukraine aid. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=212.0s)]
*  Of course, you have the Ukraine president coming to the Capitol speaking with both Senate Republicans and Democrats. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=214.0s)]
*  Unclear exactly who Zelensky is going to be speaking to on the House side. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=220.0s)]
*  But there's a real divide here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=225.0s)]
*  And so far we have not seen, you know, McConnell come to McCarthy's aid at all. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=227.0s)]
*  I don't know how actually even helpful McConnell could be at this point, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=232.0s)]
*  because clearly the more conservative part of the Republican conference in the House isn't looking to McConnell rather to solve their problems. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=236.0s)]
*  I think the biggest issue for McCarthy, you saw him get really frustrated last week, is the fact that he has such a slim majority. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=245.0s)]
*  And those Republicans on the right are really holding the rest of the government funding hostage at this point. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=253.0s)]
*  There are not many days left on that legislative calendar we just showed to strike a deal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=261.0s)]
*  We're going to be speaking to you again real soon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=266.0s)]
*  I'm certain of it. Anna Palmer, co-founder of Punchbowl News, and we'll be looking for the Punchbowl Newsletter in our inboxes shortly. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=268.0s)]
*  Thank you, Anna. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=273.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALm8uHf-XgY&t=290.0s)]
