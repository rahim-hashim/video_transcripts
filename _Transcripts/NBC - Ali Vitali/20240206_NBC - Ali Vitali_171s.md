# House set to vote on Mayorkas impeachment today
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA)
*  ask you about another development on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=0.0s)]
*  The House is expected to vote today [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=2.5s)]
*  on whether to impeach Homeland Security Secretary [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=4.32s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=6.7s)]
*  The Rules Committee advanced the resolution yesterday [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  in a party line vote. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=10.36s)]
*  Republicans argue that Mayorkas refused to comply [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=11.64s)]
*  with immigration laws, which resulted in a record surge [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=14.3s)]
*  of migrants at the southern border. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=18.0s)]
*  But some GOP lawmakers say, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=20.2s)]
*  while the situation at the border is dire, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Mayorkas's record does not meet the threshold [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=24.6s)]
*  for high crimes or treason. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  Republican Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=29.9s)]
*  has already said for his part [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=32.5s)]
*  that he won't vote for impeachment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=34.3s)]
*  And at least three other GOP lawmakers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=36.54s)]
*  say they are still undecided. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  Republicans can only lose two votes [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=40.78s)]
*  if everyone is present and voting. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=42.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Biden denounced the impeachment effort, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=45.06s)]
*  calling it, quote, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=48.1s)]
*  an unprecedented and unconstitutional act [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=49.22s)]
*  of political retribution [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  that would do nothing to solve the challenges [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=54.06s)]
*  our nation faces in securing the border. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=56.18s)]
*  And Max, that's just it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=58.26s)]
*  The Republicans are going on this, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=59.94s)]
*  which is purely partisan efforts [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=62.46s)]
*  to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=64.1s)]
*  At the exact same moment, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=66.22s)]
*  they are submarining efforts to strengthen the border. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=67.86s)]
*  So how is this gonna play out tonight when this begins? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=72.02s)]
*  It's gonna be very tight. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=77.14s)]
*  If I were to guess, I would guess Mayorkas [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=78.62s)]
*  does get impeached today simply because [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  nothing has united the Republican Conference in the House, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=82.58s)]
*  unlike impeachment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=86.6s)]
*  There are so many issues in which Republicans disagree on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=87.64s)]
*  from funding to government spending policies. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=90.44s)]
*  But one thing they agree on is they hate [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=94.0s)]
*  the Biden administration and its immigration policies. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=95.44s)]
*  I think it is a dramatic split screen, as you mentioned, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=98.56s)]
*  that there is a solution on the table [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=101.32s)]
*  negotiated by conservative Republican senators [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=103.56s)]
*  like Lankford that would actually address [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=105.8s)]
*  many of these issues of border. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=108.28s)]
*  So Republicans say it's actually endorsed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  by the Border Patrol Union. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=111.72s)]
*  This is not, I wouldn't call it a Democratic bill. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  This is a legitimate bipartisan compromise [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  with Republican and Democratic input. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=118.36s)]
*  But what's happening now is that feels sunk in the Senate [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=120.0s)]
*  and House Republicans, as you mentioned, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  are gonna impeach the cabinet official [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  in charge of handling the border. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=125.68s)]
*  And I think that's a great split screen [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=127.04s)]
*  showing it's election year, politics are playing out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=128.28s)]
*  And unfortunately, it looks like Congress [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=131.44s)]
*  might not take up the issue and might not solve it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=132.76s)]
*  and is instead gonna impeach. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=135.32s)]
*  Republicans choosing politics over country [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=137.28s)]
*  this week on Capitol Hill, no doubt there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=141.32s)]
*  Congressional reporter for Punchbowl News, Max Cohen, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=143.2s)]
*  thank you, we're gonna have much more on this issue, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=145.52s)]
*  both on way too early and then on Morning Joe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJC5-xTPQUA&t=148.24s)]
