# Trump blames Biden for Israel-Hamas war in unfocused, angry speech
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA)
*  Meandering campaign speech yesterday in New Hampshire, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump also threatened to break Biden's nose, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=4.0s)]
*  compared himself to Nelson Mandela, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=6.94s)]
*  and promised that if re-elected, he would ban immigrants [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  from entering the United States if they, quote, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  don't like our religion. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=16.28s)]
*  There was Joe Biden with his weakness [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  and what he did with Iran and others [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  that caused the attack on Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=25.28s)]
*  We're dealing with stupid people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=26.98s)]
*  The only way to stop it, people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=29.52s)]
*  He funded Hamas, Hezbollah, abroad, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  while he launched a war on patriotic citizens at home. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=33.08s)]
*  You know what I'd do with him? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=38.08s)]
*  Oh, I'd do him. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=40.0s)]
*  Boom. Boom. Boom. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=41.6s)]
*  I'd hit him right in that fake nose. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  That fake nose. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  He'd have plastic lying all over the floor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=53.92s)]
*  On day one, I will immediately restore [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=57.52s)]
*  and expand the Trump travel ban. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=59.96s)]
*  I will implement strong ideological screening [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=62.92s)]
*  of all immigrants if you hate America, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=65.88s)]
*  if you want to abolish Israel, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=68.2s)]
*  if you don't like our religion, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=70.68s)]
*  then we don't want you in our country [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=73.2s)]
*  and you are not getting in. Right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=75.2s)]
*  Joining us now, Moynihan Public Scholar Fellow [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=79.56s)]
*  at City College here in New York City, Christina Greer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Professor Greer, great to see you this morning. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=85.92s)]
*  We should note, virtually everything Donald Trump [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  just said there is not true. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  He also took credit for being the first person [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=91.76s)]
*  to notice that US, as in the United States, also is us. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=94.0s)]
*  We'll leave that aside. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  What matters, though, is some of the more serious things, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  which is, in fact, that he would, proposing to test [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  incoming migrants for their religious preferences. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=105.44s)]
*  That, of course, flies in the face [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=108.16s)]
*  of founding documents of this nation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Speak to us, if you will, about the moral [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=112.76s)]
*  and ethical implications of such a proposal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=114.72s)]
*  Good morning, John. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=118.0s)]
*  I just, I think we need to slow down the analysis sometimes [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=118.92s)]
*  because the former president is saying [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=123.16s)]
*  such dangerous rhetoric, and you hear people screaming [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=126.2s)]
*  in the audience who are in support of this, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=129.32s)]
*  but he's all over the map with his campaign stumping, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=132.16s)]
*  but it's everything from immigration to flat-out lies, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=137.36s)]
*  as you and your colleagues have to now note, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=141.0s)]
*  to really creating this us versus them, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=144.24s)]
*  and that's America versus the world. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=147.56s)]
*  It's Donald Trump and his supporters versus everyone else [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  who doesn't believe in what he believes, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=152.28s)]
*  and we're seeing someone who is facing, what, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  91 counts across several states, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=156.28s)]
*  so the desperation and the vitriol [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=159.44s)]
*  to essentially do what he tried to do on January 6th, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=162.0s)]
*  and he was pretty successful in that endeavor, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=164.96s)]
*  to really gin up his base so that if things [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=167.12s)]
*  don't go his way, they see him as the victim. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he compared himself to Nelson Mandela. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=173.72s)]
*  They see him as being attacked unfairly by everyone [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=175.8s)]
*  from Joe Biden to just black women across the board. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=178.88s)]
*  When we think about Tish James or the judge in Atlanta, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  I can't stress enough sort of the undercurrent [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=187.4s)]
*  and the overt racism and sexism and xenophobia [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  and anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim sentiment [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=195.28s)]
*  that he consistently spews, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=197.92s)]
*  and even a little anti-Semitism sprinkled in there, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=200.0s)]
*  depending on what speech he's giving, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=202.28s)]
*  and it's just so dangerous to think [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=204.84s)]
*  that he is the front runner for the Republican Party [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=206.72s)]
*  and shame on the Republican Party [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=209.64s)]
*  for letting him get this far yet again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=211.2s)]
*  In 2016, he seemed to strike a chord with some voters, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=213.88s)]
*  particularly white working class voters, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=217.44s)]
*  with his us versus them rhetoric. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=219.28s)]
*  It seems this time around, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=221.0s)]
*  he's hit on a slightly different idea, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=222.28s)]
*  this concept of, well, they, they are coming after me. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=224.88s)]
*  They could come after you next. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=228.32s)]
*  Do you think that's, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=230.2s)]
*  tell me why you think that's resonating [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=231.76s)]
*  with a pretty significant block of Republican voters, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=233.84s)]
*  and do you think that has any crossover appeal [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=236.88s)]
*  for a general election? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=239.0s)]
*  It does, Jonathan, and because in your previous segment, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=241.8s)]
*  when you talk about the price of orange juice, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=244.32s)]
*  I mean, that's real. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=246.44s)]
*  People go to the polls for pocketbook issues. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  We always have as Americans, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  and so if you can keep it somewhat vague, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=252.04s)]
*  this is why you see Donald Trump making inroads [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  with Latinos and Asian Americans [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=257.88s)]
*  in a small sector of black men. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=260.48s)]
*  Black women seem to be immune to whatever it is he's selling, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=262.72s)]
*  but if you can keep it relatively vague, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=265.44s)]
*  a lot of people, let's be honest, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=268.48s)]
*  they do feel nervous about their financial prospects. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=270.36s)]
*  They are feeling pinched when they go to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=273.32s)]
*  either the gas station or the grocery store. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=275.2s)]
*  So if he says, well, you don't have because of them, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=277.92s)]
*  they're taking, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  That the negative ethos of America [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  that has always been here, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=285.4s)]
*  that we've worked tirelessly over several hundred years [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=287.44s)]
*  to sort of erode, he's excavating consistently [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=291.08s)]
*  the worst of our values to pit us against one another, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  and we know history has told us, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=298.44s)]
*  anytime we've progressed as a country, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  it's because we've pulled together. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not because we've fought one another [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=304.2s)]
*  over essentially scraps. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=306.28s)]
*  So if we wanna talk about us versus them, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  we need to think about the tax breaks [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=309.64s)]
*  that Donald Trump gave his friends and family members. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=311.32s)]
*  We need to think about all the financial ways [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=313.96s)]
*  that he assists sort of the top 1% [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=316.04s)]
*  and not the people who are at his rallies. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=319.68s)]
*  But sadly, they don't see that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=321.92s)]
*  It's much easier just to say it's immigrants [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=324.4s)]
*  or people of color who are taking from them [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=326.84s)]
*  as opposed to Donald Trump and his party. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=328.96s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems staggering just in one speech alone, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  the number of things to shock and to horrify, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=334.4s)]
*  and yet every poll shows that he and President Biden [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=337.68s)]
*  are neck and neck with a year or so to go [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=340.36s)]
*  until election day. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna be talking about this a lot in the months ahead. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=345.72s)]
*  Moynihan Public Scholar Fellow, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=348.72s)]
*  City College of New York, Christina Greer, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=350.68s)]
*  great to see you as always, my friend. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aNpd9fBnsA&t=352.28000000000003s)]
