# Trump doubles down on calling Democrats 'enemies from within'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74)
*  Welcome back. Donald Trump is doubling down on calling Democrats enemies from within. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=0.0s)]
*  The former president first made those comments over the weekend on Fox News, and then he [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=8.64s)]
*  repeated them yesterday during a taped town hall with a network in front of an audience [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=13.84s)]
*  of all women voters. Fox News has not yet released any advanced clips of that town hall, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=18.64s)]
*  but did put out some transcripts. The town hall set to air later this morning. At the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=25.32s)]
*  same time, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who served in the Trump administration, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=29.08s)]
*  says the American people should take Trump seriously when he suggested he would use the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  military against American citizens. The former SEC def made the comments on CNN. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=38.44s)]
*  Do you fear that he would try to utilize the National Guard, the military against US citizens? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=42.96s)]
*  Yes, I do, of course, because I lived through that and I saw over the summer of 2020 where [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=53.52s)]
*  President Trump and those around him wanted to use the National Guard in various capacities [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=60.84s)]
*  in cities such as Chicago and Portland and Seattle. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is set to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=66.08s)]
*  make appearance on Fox News later today, her first ever when she sits down with the channel's chief [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  political correspondent, Brett Baer. The interview will be pre-taped in Philadelphia and then air [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=81.6s)]
*  this evening. Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst, Brandon Buck. He was communication [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=86.16s)]
*  strategist and former aid to House speakers Ryan and Boehner. Brandon, good to see you. Let's start [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=92.0s)]
*  with Donald Trump. A lot has been made the last couple days about his sort of bizarre dancing the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=97.28s)]
*  other night on stage and then yesterday a pretty nonsensical interview at the Economic Club in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=103.16s)]
*  Chicago where he was pressed on whether he would, you know, certify, admit to a defeat, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=107.88s)]
*  wouldn't answer. He also couldn't answer basic things about his economic policy. It was sort of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  a mess. But there's also perhaps just as serious, if not more, this darker rhetoric and these threats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=117.88s)]
*  And now we have a secretary of defense saying we should take him seriously. Well, I think the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  difficult thing to sort of swallow here is for the last three or four weeks he's gotten more and more [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=128.92s)]
*  attention for saying darker and darker sort of crazier things and he's paid really no price for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=132.92s)]
*  it. And we are now into another situation that's starting to feel very eerily similar. I think we've [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=137.6s)]
*  talked about this before. We're now back to where we're just sort of following around whatever [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=142.88s)]
*  Donald Trump said and did. And there's an argument that that is bad for Donald Trump. More sort of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=146.48s)]
*  Trump can be bad for him, although we're not seeing that in the polls. But I think the bigger [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=151.6s)]
*  problem for the Harris campaign is what do you do with this? People have heard him talk about things [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  like this for many years. One, does it move anybody still? But also, if you're the Harris campaign, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=159.44s)]
*  you need to break through. You need to not allow Donald Trump to be driving what we talk about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=164.76s)]
*  every day. She was at her best. How does she do that? That's the challenge. She was at her best, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=169.44s)]
*  obviously, when she rolled out. She had this great convention. She was setting the tone of the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=174.48s)]
*  campaign. At this point, it's very hard to see how she jumps back in and is setting the tone. I [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=178.2s)]
*  thought there was going to be another debate because I thought Donald Trump was going to be down [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=184.32s)]
*  significantly enough that he needed one. Now denying her another debate is a big problem for her [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=187.48s)]
*  because where does she jump in that she is able to wrestle this way that no one has really been [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=192.24s)]
*  able to wrestle away the spotlight from Donald Trump other than Kamala Harris for a little while, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=196.44s)]
*  but it feels like that's gone. It's a great point. She's winning the big moments, her rollout, the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=199.96s)]
*  convention, and then that debate. And she's gotten a burst, but that burst keeps dissipating and she [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  doesn't have necessarily another big moment coming, at least not a scheduled one. So imagine that's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  what they're trying to sit around. What can we do? What kind of endorsement can we roll out? What [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  are the big things that we can do at this moment? I think they're doing a lot of the right blocking [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=216.4s)]
*  and tackling things and talking to the right voters. I just worry that if we are spending the next [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=219.8s)]
*  three weeks allowing Donald Trump to dictate what issues we're talking about, that is an advantage [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=224.6s)]
*  for him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=228.84s)]
*  And she's certainly doing more and more media appearances. She's getting in front of more voters. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=229.12s)]
*  Her campaign schedule is also picked up. Today, Fox News, first time ever doing it. Give us your [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=232.48s)]
*  thoughts. What's the risk reward here for her? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=238.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think you were talking earlier with Ken Thomas about those little slivers of votes that she [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=242.12s)]
*  needs to get. And some of those are those sort of soft Republicans who don't like Trump, but have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=246.44s)]
*  been hammered with ads showing her as a progressive, out of touch, San Francisco liberal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=251.68s)]
*  And she needs to communicate to those people that, hey, look, that's not who I am. That's not what. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=257.8s)]
*  And they've been trying to do that over and over again. Her convention speech was all about, you [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=262.08s)]
*  know, she's going to be tough on the border. She owns a gun. All those kinds of things. We're trying [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=266.0s)]
*  to signal, I'm not this out of touch progressive that you need to be worried about. I'm a safe vote. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=270.08s)]
*  And I think that's what she's trying to do here with Fox News. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  But one thing we also want to make sure we talk to you about since your experience with House [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  speakers is Mike Johnson, Republican speaker, has he has already said that he and members of his [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=282.24s)]
*  party will only certify the results of this coming election if they think it's fair, which is we can [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=287.92s)]
*  leave wide open to interpretation as to what that means. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=293.68s)]
*  Talk to us about the pressures he's going to be under if Donald Trump loses. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, Will, do you think he would certify a Kamala Harris victory? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=302.32s)]
*  Yeah, this is the scenario where Donald Trump loses and the House is still held by Republicans. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=307.12s)]
*  And Mike Johnson is trying to remain speaker. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=311.76s)]
*  And I think we need to look back at what happened to Kevin McCarthy, who it took him several days [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=314.68s)]
*  and several rounds of voting to get the necessary votes to be speaker. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=319.0s)]
*  I'd like people to imagine the scenario where Mike Johnson now has to ask those same people what they [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=322.52s)]
*  would like to what they need from him to vote for him for speaker. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=326.52s)]
*  The speaker vote happens on January 3rd. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=329.52s)]
*  You certify the election on January 6th. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=332.0s)]
*  It's not hard to imagine that Mike Johnson is going to tell a lot of those hardline conservatives, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=334.56s)]
*  I'm not going to bring up a certification vote. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=339.52s)]
*  I'm not going to allow that to happen if Donald Trump is protesting the outcome of the election. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=342.32s)]
*  We may not have a speaker of the House by January 6th. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=346.36s)]
*  It's very likely that if Republicans maintain the House in that scenario, it's a very small [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=349.48s)]
*  majority. They have two or three seats. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=353.56s)]
*  If you have four or five Republicans who say, I'm not going to vote for Mike Johnson, I'm not going [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  to vote for anybody who says they're going to certify the election, we could end up in, I hate to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=359.4s)]
*  use this term, a constitutional crisis where there is nobody overseeing the House at a time when we [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=363.35999999999996s)]
*  need to certify the results of the election. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. It can't be overstated. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=369.84s)]
*  What we saw January 6th, four years ago, we had never been there before, but we may be barreling [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  towards another sort of unthinkable political moment in the weeks ahead. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=376.28s)]
*  MSNBC political analyst, Brendan Buck. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=380.88s)]
*  Brendan, thank you so much. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  Really good stuff this morning. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=383.64s)]
*  We will talk to you again real soon. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tdxzaMjF74&t=384.44s)]
