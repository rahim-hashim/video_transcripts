# Booming economy doesn't boost Biden's approval numbers
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI)
*  The US economy added 353,000 jobs last month, blowing past expectations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=0.0s)]
*  Economists had predicted gains of about 185,000, but Friday's figure released by the Labor [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=6.72s)]
*  Department was nearly double that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Additionally, the unemployment rate held steady at 3%, despite predictions that it would rise. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=15.52s)]
*  Those numbers were so strong that even a top White House economic adviser under former [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  President Trump was compelled to acknowledge the good news. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=27.32s)]
*  I know many of my conservative friends are trying to drill holes in this report. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=32.64s)]
*  But you know what, folks? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  It's a very strong report. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=41.32s)]
*  Not every economic stat should be viewed through a political lens. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=43.2s)]
*  I've been in this business a very long time, and sometimes you just have to throw away [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=48.2s)]
*  the ballot box and just recognize the numbers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=52.44s)]
*  They are what they are. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=55.84s)]
*  This was a very strong report. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=57.28s)]
*  Refreshing and sadly rare there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=61.08s)]
*  But despite the strong jobs report, new polling from NBC News shows that just 36% of registered [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  voters approve of how President Biden has been handling the economy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=70.16s)]
*  And when asked who they would trust more to handle the economy, 55% said Donald Trump, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=74.56s)]
*  compared to 33% who said Biden. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=80.2s)]
*  Joining us now to help break down the numbers, senior political editor for NBC News, Mark Murray. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Mark, morning. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=88.64s)]
*  Good to see you this morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=89.64s)]
*  So let's, the economy first weigh in on that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=90.64s)]
*  That's bad news for a president running for reelection. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  Talk to us though also about some other issues and tell us who voters trust more. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, you're exactly right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=101.4s)]
*  That economic handling difference between President Biden and Donald Trump really seems [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=103.92s)]
*  to be the headline on that issue battery. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=110.16s)]
*  It's worth noting we've asked that question going back to the 2020 presidential election, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=113.2s)]
*  Jonathan, when at the time then President Donald Trump had a seven point advantage over [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=118.04s)]
*  Joe Biden on that question one month before the 2020 election. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=123.28s)]
*  Now it's in Trump's direction by 22 percentage points. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=127.44s)]
*  And on other issues, our poll has Donald Trump with a 35 point lead when it comes to handling [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=131.0s)]
*  the border and immigration. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=137.5s)]
*  21 points on crime and violence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=139.46s)]
*  11 points on improving America's standing in the world. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=143.38s)]
*  President Biden leads on abortion and handling that by 12 percentage points and on treating [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=147.58s)]
*  immigrants and protecting immigrant rights by 17 percentage points. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=153.62s)]
*  So to be clear, election day a long way off, lots of things can change. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=158.58s)]
*  And there's been some other polls recently, pretty positive for President Biden. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  This one is undoubtedly rough for the White House, as so is his approval rating that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=167.05999999999997s)]
*  we just you have in the poll there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=173.06s)]
*  Tell us about that and how that number compares with other incumbents in this point in their [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=174.42s)]
*  presidencies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=179.7s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, our poll has President Biden's approval rating at 37 percent among registered [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=180.7s)]
*  voters, 60 percent disapprove of his job. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=186.22s)]
*  That's down from November when our poll showed President Biden's approval rating at 40 percentage [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=189.77999999999997s)]
*  points. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=194.5s)]
*  Compared to past presidents, we have not had a president with that low of an approval rating [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=195.58s)]
*  facing reelection. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=201.86s)]
*  Donald Trump, one point was in the 30s during his presidency, but a year before his reelection [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=203.22s)]
*  bid, he was back into the low 40s. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=209.42s)]
*  And the our poll shows that President Biden's approval rating right now at 37 percent. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=212.26s)]
*  You have to go back to George W. Bush's second term to find an American president with that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=218.34s)]
*  low of an approval rating in our NBC News polling. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=224.18s)]
*  And the overall head to head matchup has Trump up on Biden, 47 to 42 percent. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=227.82s)]
*  But Mark, tell us how that number changes if Donald Trump would be convicted in one [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=232.62s)]
*  of the trials he faces. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=237.22s)]
*  Yeah, our poll saved to the very last question, Jonathan, a question on all right, we asked [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  you what your presidential ballot on the head to head versus Donald Trump and Joe Biden. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=245.22s)]
*  As you ended up mentioning, Donald Trump has a five point advantage within the margin of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  error over President Biden. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=254.46s)]
*  But on the very last question of the poll, when asked, OK, who would you end up voting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=256.74s)]
*  for if Donald Trump is convicted of a felony in the next year? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=261.46s)]
*  The numbers change. It goes to President Biden, 45 percent, Donald Trump, 43 percent. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  So a two point lead for President Biden on that survey. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=272.58s)]
*  And again, that's a hypothetical. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=276.26s)]
*  It's worth noting that we have a long ways to go, not only in the presidential election, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  but also when it comes to Donald Trump's legal calendar. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=282.26s)]
*  Yeah, and even the Republican primary is still ongoing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  Lastly, Mark, talk to us about this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=287.74s)]
*  This is an eye grabbing number. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=289.78s)]
*  Those the numbers on necessary that they believe the president, the candidate has a necessary [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  mental and physical health to be president. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=296.86s)]
*  Yes. So when we compare Donald Trump and Joe Biden on that, Donald Trump has a 23 point [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=300.06s)]
*  advantage on having the necessary mental and physical fitness to be president. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=307.3s)]
*  And, Jonathan, it's worth noting, again, we asked that question in 2020 right before that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=312.74s)]
*  presidential election and the score was pretty much tied. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=317.94s)]
*  And so we do see an erosion for President Biden in our polling, not only in the economy, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=321.06s)]
*  but also on this fitness question. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=327.46s)]
*  Only 23 percent suggest that Biden would be fit for off to be president. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=329.74s)]
*  Again, that's a tough number there. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=333.98s)]
*  Senior political editor for NBC News, Mark Murray, thank you for walking through all [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=335.74s)]
*  that with us. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=338.97999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  And thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on this Monday morning. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  Morning Joe starts right now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_nH_eBwsAI&t=344.46s)]
