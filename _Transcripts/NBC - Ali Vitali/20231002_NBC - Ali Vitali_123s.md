# Trump blasts judge and AG ahead of NY fraud trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk)
*  where in just a few hours, Donald Trump is scheduled to be seated in a Manhattan courtroom [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=0.0s)]
*  for the start of a civil fraud trial against him. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=5.0s)]
*  The former president arrived at his one-time home at Trump Tower last night, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=8.0s)]
*  a building that could soon be taken away from him, pending the decision of Judge Arthur Engelrand. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=13.0s)]
*  In a non-jury trial last week, that judge found that Trump, his two oldest sons, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=21.0s)]
*  and his company are all liable of fraud in a case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=28.0s)]
*  Today, the punishment phase of the trial will begin, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=35.0s)]
*  where the former president could be fined $250 million [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=38.0s)]
*  and be forced to give up all of his New York state properties. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=43.0s)]
*  On social media last night, Trump blasted what he called a sham case [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=48.0s)]
*  and wrote that the judge should resign for his, quote, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=53.0s)]
*  criminal interference of the 2024 election. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=57.0s)]
*  Although he is on the witness list for both the defense and the prosecution, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=61.0s)]
*  it's unclear if Trump will testify at the trial. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=65.0s)]
*  Here's what he told NBC's Vaughn Hilliard on the campaign trail over the weekend. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=68.0s)]
*  Do you plan to testify? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=74.0s)]
*  It's a disgrace. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=76.0s)]
*  Do you plan to testify? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=77.0s)]
*  It's a rigged, everything about this city is rigged. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=78.0s)]
*  You said that you'd like to... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=81.0s)]
*  It's all rigged. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=82.0s)]
*  This whole country is rigged out. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=83.0s)]
*  Why did you overstate the size of your Trump Tower apartment by 20,000 square feet? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=84.0s)]
*  Why do you have to read that? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=87.0s)]
*  Why can't you remember it? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=88.0s)]
*  Why do you read that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=89.0s)]
*  Wait, can you remember it? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=90.0s)]
*  So why did you overstate the size of your apartment by 20,000 square feet? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=91.0s)]
*  You said that your apartment was valued... [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=96.0s)]
*  Well, my financial statement is just for you, by the way. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=98.0s)]
*  You said it was valued. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=100.0s)]
*  It's a rigged deal. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=101.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEVrKXrpmk&t=112.0s)]
