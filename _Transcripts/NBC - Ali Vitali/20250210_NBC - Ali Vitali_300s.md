# Trump doubles down on Canada becoming 51st state
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI)
*  The prime minister said this weekend to a group of Canadian businessmen, he was at a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=0.0s)]
*  private meeting, he said that your wish for Canada to be the 51st state is a quote, real [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=3.84s)]
*  thing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=9.52s)]
*  Is it a real thing? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=10.52s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=11.52s)]
*  I think Canada would be much better off being a 51st state because we lose $200 billion [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=12.52s)]
*  a year with Canada. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=18.36s)]
*  I won't let that happen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=20.16s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=21.16s)]
*  Why are we paying $200 billion a year essentially in subsidy to Canada? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=22.16s)]
*  And now if they're a 51st state, I don't mind doing it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=26.68s)]
*  That was President Trump doubling down on his wish for Canada to join the United States [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=30.52s)]
*  during his interview with Fox News yesterday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=34.68s)]
*  Last week, Trump threatened harsh tariffs against Canada and Mexico, but delayed them [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=37.24s)]
*  both after both countries promised to send 10,000 troops to each border. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=41.06s)]
*  Now Trump is claiming those actions aren't enough to stop the tariffs, saying it's quote, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  not sustainable and that he is changing it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=49.6s)]
*  Joining us now, senior political reporter for Axios, Alex Eisenstadt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=53.0s)]
*  First, I just want to talk about what we're hearing there from the president saying it's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=56.44s)]
*  not enough to delay the tariffs. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=60.36s)]
*  At the same time, though, even as he says he's serious about making Canada a 51st state, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=62.2s)]
*  you've got his national security advisor this weekend on Meet the Press saying, no, no, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=66.48s)]
*  there's no military plans to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=69.56s)]
*  Explaining it away, but you see shades of negotiation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=72.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the classic Trump move. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=74.6s)]
*  You start at one place to get the other party to meet you somewhere in the middle. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=77.12s)]
*  And so is he serious about a military intervention here? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=82.12s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=85.72s)]
*  But what he does want to do is he does want to move Canada to some place where there could [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=86.72s)]
*  be some notion of agreement. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=89.4s)]
*  So this is where he starts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=91.16s)]
*  We're seeing this on the foreign stage, though, not just with him there, but also in the relation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=92.16s)]
*  to the way that he's talking about Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=97.92s)]
*  And so this is the question, right, which is when he says these things, do you necessarily [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=98.92s)]
*  take it literally from the beginning point, or is there sort of a broader discussion he's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=102.68s)]
*  trying to open when he says these kinds of things? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=107.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems like you're looking at it from the perspective of, okay, maybe on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=109.32s)]
*  negotiating, but then on the domestic stuff, a lot of the things that he said on the campaign [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=113.08s)]
*  trail are things that he's actually doing now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=116.88s)]
*  I want to pivot to an excerpt that we have of your new book coming out in early March. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=119.0s)]
*  Congratulations early. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=122.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=123.84s)]
*  But it's all about the fears that might be more deep than previously reported around [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=124.84s)]
*  Iran and threats against the president's life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=129.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=133.04s)]
*  Well, back in September, the fears about Iran and a potential assassination attempt towards [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=134.04s)]
*  then candidate Trump were far more serious than people knew. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=138.6s)]
*  There was a particular point where Trump was informed by law enforcement that Iranians [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=141.8s)]
*  had agents in the U.S. with access to surface-to-air missiles that could be used to down his personal [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=146.84s)]
*  plane, otherwise known as Trump Force One. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  And so he used a decoy plane at one point, a plane used by his donor, who is Steve Witkoff, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  who is now a BDS envoy, and his staff was kept in Trump Force One, which upset them [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  a little bit to some degree. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=167.84s)]
*  Which upset them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=169.08s)]
*  But it shows the degree to which there was concern about his life. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=170.92s)]
*  This was a very serious situation as it related to Iran and their desire to kill him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=175.84s)]
*  It also brought us, you bring viewers and readers in to what that flight was like. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=180.2s)]
*  You said a lot of gallows humor? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=184.84s)]
*  I would expect. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=186.12s)]
*  It was completely surreal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=187.12s)]
*  And so these staffers didn't know until the moment before, the moment the plane doors [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=188.16s)]
*  shut, they noticed that Trump wasn't in his seat, the seat that he usually sits in. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=192.92s)]
*  They were informed by campaign leadership. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=198.28s)]
*  Look, the candidate Trump's not on the seat. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=199.88s)]
*  It's just going to be us today. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=203.56s)]
*  And there was a lot of, well, what happens if the plane goes down? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=205.6s)]
*  So it was a very surreal experience for them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=208.32s)]
*  If this is a founded fear, I mean, they're basically sitting there as bait. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=210.44s)]
*  I know it says something that we haven't yet heard about the fears around Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=214.76s)]
*  Doesn't that also tell us something about Trump and the way that his orbit was run during [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=219.84s)]
*  the campaign? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=224.56s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=225.56s)]
*  They kept things very tight and they had to work really hard at that point to convince [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=227.32s)]
*  staffers that they weren't being used as bait. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=233.0s)]
*  And there was a lot of anger about how that flight played out during it and after it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=235.4s)]
*  It was something that people talked about for months afterwards. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=240.56s)]
*  Yeah, certainly something that they would talk about for months because you called it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=242.96s)]
*  in your book at one point a ghost flight. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=246.32s)]
*  It was known as the ghost flight. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=248.22s)]
*  That was the name that it sort of became this thing in Trump campaign lore. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=250.96s)]
*  And there were a lot of hard feelings about it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  Wouldn't you expect that there would be though? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=259.44s)]
*  I mean, that leadership wouldn't tell you you're on a flight like that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=261.48s)]
*  Yeah, and some of them wondered why they didn't just take commercial to get to where they [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=264.32s)]
*  needed to be. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=267.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=268.92s)]
*  A really fantastic question. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=269.92s)]
*  One that I'm sure we will be asking as we dig into your book, Senior Political Reporter [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  for Axios, Alex Eisenstadt. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=274.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=276.26s)]
*  We're going to have you back to talk more about your upcoming book, Revenge. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVoGfffS2pI&t=277.26s)]
