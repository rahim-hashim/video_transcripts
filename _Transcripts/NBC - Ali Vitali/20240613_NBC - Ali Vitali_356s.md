# White House does not say if the president will commute son Hunter's sentence
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y)
*  Now, back here at home, there are growing questions this morning about President Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  potentially commuting the sentence of his son Hunter, following his conviction earlier [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=6.04s)]
*  this week on three federal gun charges. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=10.48s)]
*  Now, during an interview last week, President Biden clearly said that he would not pardon [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=12.24s)]
*  his son if he were to be convicted. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=16.48s)]
*  Hunter Biden, of course, has been just that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=18.64s)]
*  But yesterday, White House Press Secretary Corrine Jean-Pierre told reporters she simply [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=21.52s)]
*  could not say whether the president might consider a commutation of his son's sentence. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=25.16s)]
*  The president, I have not spoken to the president about this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=29.92s)]
*  And what I'm saying is he was asked about a pardon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=34.92s)]
*  He was asked about he was asked about the trial specifically. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=37.68s)]
*  He answered it very clearly, very forthright. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=43.0s)]
*  As we know, the sentencing hasn't even been scheduled yet. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=46.28s)]
*  I don't have anything beyond what the president said. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=48.84s)]
*  He's been very clear about this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=51.56s)]
*  Sort of a non-answer there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=54.24s)]
*  White House official clarified to NBC News later on that any conversation about Hunter [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=55.24s)]
*  Biden's sentence would be premature since there is no sentencing date yet. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  The official also pointed to President Biden's statement released after the verdict, saying [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=63.32s)]
*  he would respect the judicial process as it moves forward. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=67.44s)]
*  At the same time, the president and his wife, First Lady Jill Biden, appear to be striking [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=71.36s)]
*  a defiant tone in the wake of their son's guilty verdict. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=75.88s)]
*  The president and first lady are returning to business as usual with the president, as [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=79.2s)]
*  we just showed you, in Europe for the G7 and Dr. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=82.24s)]
*  Jill Biden embarking on an extended five-state campaign swing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  People say, people close to the family say their posture is intentional and familiar [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=89.44s)]
*  to them after experiencing greater setbacks in the past, really rallying together here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=93.72s)]
*  Additionally, the Biden campaign signaled yesterday that it would not let Hunter Biden's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=98.6s)]
*  conviction prevent it from attacking former President Trump over his own felony convictions [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  from his hush money trial. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=106.44s)]
*  I broke that news earlier in the week. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=107.44s)]
*  Yesterday, the Biden camp indeed called out Trump for not actively campaigning this week [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=109.0s)]
*  after Trump previously complained that his courtroom proceedings in New York were unfairly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=114.2s)]
*  keeping him off the trail. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=119.6s)]
*  The Biden campaign issued this statement. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=121.34s)]
*  Donald Trump is either too lazy, too tired, or too incapable of the campaign after his [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=123.56s)]
*  criminal conviction. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=127.4s)]
*  Wednesdays are now just another day of rest for Donald. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=128.84s)]
*  Joining us now here on set, elections reporter for Politico, Madison Fernandez. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=131.96s)]
*  Madison, good to see you this morning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=136.2s)]
*  Let's start with the Hunter Biden conviction. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=139.44s)]
*  You know, certainly those close to the president worry about the personal toll it's going to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  take on him as we now await sentencing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=146.6s)]
*  And Hunter Biden does have another trial in California coming up this fall on tax issues. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  But what about the politics of it? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=152.96s)]
*  In these first 24, 48 hours or so, what are Democrats and Republicans saying? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=154.76s)]
*  Do they think that voters are going to care? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=158.88s)]
*  You know, Republicans certainly hope that voters are going to care. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=161.44s)]
*  They see it as fodder and a sort of counter to all the attacks that the Biden campaign [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=164.32s)]
*  are really leaning into with Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=170.0s)]
*  You know, they've ramped up their attacks lately, calling Trump a felon and a crook. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=171.76s)]
*  And they're really coming out of the gate with that in light of his conviction. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=176.84s)]
*  So Republicans are hoping that, you know, this is just something they can use, too. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=180.4s)]
*  But Democrats, you know, really seem to be downplaying that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=184.72s)]
*  It does seem it is striking that we've of course heard for years that Republicans claim [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=188.44s)]
*  that Joe Biden is too old and doesn't have enough energy to be president. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=192.48s)]
*  But we're seeing President Biden currently on his second European trip in a week or so [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=195.2s)]
*  and continues the pace of the office. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=201.2s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump continues to remain at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=203.44s)]
*  I know he's heading to Washington today. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  We have more live shots right now, actually, of President Biden there in Europe at the G7. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=208.04s)]
*  Trump's campaign schedule remains remarkably light. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=211.76s)]
*  What's the thinking behind that? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=214.32s)]
*  You know, he is going to be in Michigan this weekend. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=216.24s)]
*  And I think that is significant because, you know, it's a swing state. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=219.32s)]
*  It's going to be really important come November. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=222.84s)]
*  And he's heading to Wisconsin next week. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=224.52s)]
*  So we're sort of seeing him go to these swing states here and there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=226.32s)]
*  And it's definitely starting to pick up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  So let's talk about what is going to be a real centerpiece of this campaign. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=233.2s)]
*  The first presidential debate is two weeks from today, the earliest we've had a general [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=237.12s)]
*  election debate in modern American history. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=241.16s)]
*  It seems that the Biden campaign believes this is a moment to remind Americans just [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=244.48s)]
*  who Donald Trump is and what he wants to do for a second term. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=249.12s)]
*  Give us a little more as to what also the Biden team, but also the Trump team, hopes [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=254.16s)]
*  to accomplish in that debate and how are they preparing for it? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=258.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as you said, this is the earliest debate and it is a really important juncture [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=260.88s)]
*  to make sure that voters are getting a sense and sort of reevaluating where we are right [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=265.88s)]
*  now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=272.08s)]
*  But also at the same time, so much can change in the coming months. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=273.08s)]
*  I think that they're really going to want to come out of the gate showing Biden as a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  really strong and capable leader, especially in light of Trump's consistent attacks that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=280.56s)]
*  he's too old to do the job. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=289.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=291.04s)]
*  Elections reporter for Politico, Madison Fernandez. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=292.04s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  And we are keeping a live look on the G7. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  We're seeing there Prime Minister Maloney sort of opening the summit right now with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=297.44s)]
*  some introductory remarks. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=301.68s)]
*  President Biden, among the world leaders, sitting and listening. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=303.12s)]
*  These are the world's largest democratic economies meeting here with Ukraine at the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=307.44s)]
*  front of their agenda. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=312.68s)]
*  These conversations coming as Russia continues to pound Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  One of the goals to use Russia, seize Russian assets to help continue to fund Ukraine for [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=320.44s)]
*  years to come, even if there is a change of leadership at the top of some of these countries [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=325.68s)]
*  and that could include the United States this November. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=330.12s)]
*  We will have more from the G7 as the morning continues. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTqcdFPCk5Y&t=333.36s)]
