# Vance criticizes Harris when asked what makes him happy
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE)
*  While speaking at a campaign event in Michigan yesterday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=0.0s)]
*  JD Vance was asked simply what makes him happy. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=3.04s)]
*  But instead of giving a real answer, he used the moment to criticize Vice President Harris. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  You've been criticized as being too serious, too angry sometimes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=12.24s)]
*  What makes you smile? What makes you happy? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=16.56s)]
*  Well, I smile at a lot of things, including bogus questions from the media, man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=21.28s)]
*  I mean, look, I think if you watch a full speech that I give, I actually am having a good time out here and I'm enjoying this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=25.36s)]
*  But look, sometimes you got to take the good with the bad. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=33.12s)]
*  And right now I am angry about what Kamala Harris has done to this country and done to the American southern border. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=36.4s)]
*  And I think that most people in our country, they can be happy-go-lucky sometimes, they can enjoy things sometimes, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=42.0s)]
*  and they can turn on the news and recognize that what's going on in this country is a disgrace. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=48.0s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst Brandon Buck. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=52.72s)]
*  He was communication strategist and former aide to House speakers Ryan and Boehner. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=57.52s)]
*  Brandon, good to see you. I mean, that's a layup. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=62.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=66.16s)]
*  And he missed it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=66.72s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I worked for Paul Ryan when he was the VP nominee. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=67.92s)]
*  And I know that there's a lot of pressure and intensity, especially in the very beginning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=71.92s)]
*  And clearly he is off to a rough start. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=75.92s)]
*  But that was as easy as it gets. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=78.48s)]
*  And all these people are really looking for from him in a situation like that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  And sort of generally is, are you a normal person? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  Are you likable? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  We can talk about issues all day, but if people just don't like you as a person, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  they're never going to connect with you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=92.72s)]
*  They're never going to listen to what you have to say. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=93.76s)]
*  And the fact that he couldn't answer a simple question like that, he got asked also yesterday, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  why someone would want to have a beer with him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  And he did the same sort of awkward laughing thing and eventually said, well, because I like to have beer. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=101.44s)]
*  It feels to connect with actual real people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=106.48s)]
*  What makes you happy? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=109.84s)]
*  The answer is spending time with my family, going to a ball game. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=110.64s)]
*  You don't need to. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=113.2s)]
*  But it seems like he also had this stunt on the tarmac yesterday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=114.56s)]
*  You mentioned earlier where he tried to chase Vice President Harris. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=118.56s)]
*  It kind of came across as bullying. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=120.96s)]
*  I mean, as you say, it has been a shaky rollout. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=123.2s)]
*  How does he course correct? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=125.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're clearly in his head at this point. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=127.2s)]
*  And he doesn't really seem to know what he wants to do or what he wants to say, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=129.12s)]
*  what image he wants to present. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=131.52s)]
*  I don't mind trying to sort of go after the other side at all. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=133.6s)]
*  I think he needs to get back to really, really basics. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=137.84s)]
*  What is your job? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=140.56s)]
*  Your job is to appeal to the American people to talk about why Donald Trump is a better choice than [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=141.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  He seems so convinced on trying to convince people that he is good, that they should like him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=150.4s)]
*  And he can't figure out how to do that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=154.56s)]
*  I think he needs to pare it back a little bit and train a little bit more focus on his job. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  One thing he is doing is acting as an attack dog, which often is the running mate role. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=162.72s)]
*  He's going after now Governor Walz, talking about a military record, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=166.48s)]
*  just handling of the George Floyd protests. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=170.72s)]
*  Do you think these GOP talking points are going to be effective? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=173.44s)]
*  I think this is actually a real issue. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=175.68s)]
*  I think this is something that the Harris campaign is going to have to take pretty seriously. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=177.12s)]
*  There's a very good, deeply reported story in the Washington Post this morning [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=180.48s)]
*  about the decision that Tim Walz made to leave the reserves. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=184.72s)]
*  And it does appear that he did know that he was going to be deployed right before he decided to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=189.28s)]
*  leave. Whether or not he had a good reason to do that, I think that the ads for something like [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  that sort of write themselves and can be pretty devastating. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=199.2s)]
*  Somebody who did serve 24 years and did go to school in the GI bill, but when had to be asked [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  to go to serve or was expected to be asked to serve, didn't. Whether or not you have a good [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=207.2s)]
*  reason, I don't know. I think that is a real political issue. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=211.76s)]
*  We know that the Trump campaign and Chris LaSavita is very familiar with running Swiftboat ads [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=213.84s)]
*  against John Kerry. I would keep a very close eye on that. They don't seem to have a very good [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=219.44s)]
*  answer for that. To be clear, he did serve more than two decades, but it does seem it was picking [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=223.12s)]
*  up some traction on the right. We will see how the Harris campaign responds today. Lastly, though, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=228.16s)]
*  the race has clearly changed. Further evidence, the Cook political report, which we assess as the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  state of the play, just in the last few minutes, made three changes. Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=238.8s)]
*  all they had previously categorized as leaning Republican. Now all three toss-ups. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  The map has completely changed. Before, Joe Biden's only path to winning was winning those [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=250.0s)]
*  blue wall states. There was really no hope to do anything. Now she could potentially lose [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=254.56s)]
*  a Michigan. She could potentially lose a Wisconsin and still pick up enough states elsewhere to win. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=259.92s)]
*  It completely changes the dynamic. Now they have the resources to be able to play in a lot of those [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=265.44s)]
*  states. The amount of money they're raising, they're not only going to be able to go into [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=269.44s)]
*  Arizona, Nevada, Georgia. They might be able to go into North Carolina and try to put some more [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  places where Republicans need to be on defense. It's a very different election now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=275.92s)]
*  She'll be in Michigan today and then heads out west to those battlegrounds. MSNBC political [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=281.92s)]
*  analyst, Brendan Buck, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=285.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VI0hAhg8nE&t=295.44s)]
