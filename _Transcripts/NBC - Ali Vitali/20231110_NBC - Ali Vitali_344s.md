# Discussing congress' efforts to fight for vets
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A)
*  We take a moment to note, of course, that tomorrow is Veterans Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=0.0s)]
*  The nation honors its service members each year on November 11th, a date coinciding with [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=3.88s)]
*  the end of World War I. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=9.22s)]
*  According to a Census Bureau data collected by the Pew Research Center, there are more [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=11.48s)]
*  than 18 million veterans in America today, accounting for roughly 6 percent of the adult [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=16.46s)]
*  population. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  President Biden plans to go to Arlington National Cemetery tomorrow to mark the day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=23.48s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=29.0s)]
*  He's an Iraq War and Navy veteran. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=32.96s)]
*  He also serves as the vice ranking member on the Committee of Veteran Affairs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=35.24s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for being with us this morning, and thank you, of course, for your [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=39.16s)]
*  service. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=42.4s)]
*  In recognition of this weekend, give us the latest, if you will, as to what Washington [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=43.4s)]
*  is being able to do right now for veterans, and in what ways do things need to improve? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=49.08s)]
*  John, thank you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  I think the biggest thing that's happened for my fellow veterans was President Biden [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=56.92s)]
*  signing the PACT Act last year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=61.08s)]
*  You talked to Vietnam-era veterans. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=63.56s)]
*  They had to fight for years, decades, some, to get the care and benefits they earned from [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=65.2s)]
*  exposure to things like Agent Orange. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=70.48s)]
*  I hope and think now because of President Biden's leadership here, because of what happened [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=73.36s)]
*  in the Congress, my fellow veterans exposed to burn pits, places like Iraq, Afghanistan, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  we aren't going to have those decade-long fights. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=82.92s)]
*  I think it's part of this country standing up for what it believes in, for honoring its [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=86.2s)]
*  obligation to those who wore the uniform. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=91.8s)]
*  And so that's the biggest positive accomplishment. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=94.28s)]
*  The things that I see hurting veterans, you know, I saw proposed cuts come out of my [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=98.12s)]
*  Republican colleagues earlier this year that would have hurt veterans and VA funding. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=102.28s)]
*  And I often think about, you know, we say we see and hear thank you for your service. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=108.12s)]
*  And often it's not backed up enough by action, by making sure we have a fully funded and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  staffed VA, that mental health care is there for my fellow veterans and more. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=118.84s)]
*  So I always want to encourage folks express that gratitude, but then push and make sure [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=122.96s)]
*  your legislators, your elected officials are there standing up and fighting for veterans [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=127.88s)]
*  and the care that we need. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=131.84s)]
*  Yeah, a few things more important. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=133.6s)]
*  Thank you for delivering that message, Congressman. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=136.52s)]
*  We mentioned earlier in the show, the ongoing dysfunction in the House of Representatives [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=138.8s)]
*  with the cancellation of these party line votes on funding bills ahead of the looming [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=143.2s)]
*  possible looming government shutdown just one week away. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=148.88s)]
*  Give us your assessment, your reaction to what's going on on the Republican side. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  And how worried are you that a deal, even a continued resolution, won't be reached by [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  next Friday? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=161.04s)]
*  Don, you're right. As you say, the Republican leadership has now pulled several of these [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=162.48s)]
*  spending bills. And let's go back a few months. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  We have under the law now an agreement for a budget. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=169.6s)]
*  This was the debt ceiling deal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  This then Speaker McCarthy and President Biden worked out there wasn't a perfect deal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Was a compromise. I voted for it like most Democrats, most Republicans supported it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=178.92s)]
*  I've urged my Republican colleagues to just honor the law, honor that deal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=183.32s)]
*  And let's have spending bills that aren't filled with these poison pill cultural attacks, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=187.88s)]
*  these anti-abortion provisions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  And let's just honor the deal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=193.88s)]
*  Since they aren't doing that clearly and they don't even have the votes on their own side [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  right now to pass those bills, they should move a clean continuing resolution. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=199.44s)]
*  Let's keep the government funded and open and not do some crazy partisan right-wing [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=204.0s)]
*  thing. I haven't nor has anyone seen what Speaker Johnson is going to offer for a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=208.84s)]
*  continuing resolution. So I don't even know what their proposal is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=214.56s)]
*  And keep in mind, we have a week, one week left to get this done before the government [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=217.32s)]
*  might shut down. It will hurt a lot of people in this country if that happens. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=222.16s)]
*  Yeah, there had been seemingly some momentum for a continuing resolution. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  That now seems a little bit in doubt. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  Congressman, lastly, we of course mentioned that you are a veteran of the Iraq war. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=231.76s)]
*  So give us your analysis, if you will, about where things stand in the Israel Hamas war. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=235.72s)]
*  You know, moving into sort of urban warfare there in Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  What do you think? What are the risks there for Israel? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=244.24s)]
*  And what are your fears about the possibility of the war expanding beyond Hamas? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=247.2s)]
*  Well, I hope that it doesn't. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=252.72s)]
*  And certainly Israel needs to defeat Hamas, which has brought suffering to so many in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=254.0s)]
*  Palestine and Israel. And so I think if you talk to anyone who served in the wars of our [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=259.84s)]
*  generation of veterans, whether in Iraq or Afghanistan, but certainly given the urban [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=266.0s)]
*  nature of the fighting in much of Iraq, they'll tell you that it's hard, that it requires [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=270.72s)]
*  restraint and discretion, especially against an enemy, in this case, Hamas, that is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=274.88s)]
*  willing to put civilians, innocent people at risk to embed themselves in a civilian [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=279.32s)]
*  population. It requires discretion. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=283.96s)]
*  I know the Biden administration, Secretary Blinken in particular, has been urging that [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=286.4s)]
*  kind of discretion on the part of our Israeli friends as they take the fight to Hamas and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=292.0s)]
*  defeat them as they must. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=296.52s)]
*  So I've continued to encourage that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  And I've been glad to see several of my colleagues who have experience in wars like Iraq [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  sharing their voice here and reminding folks that these fights aren't easy and you can [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=305.32s)]
*  really see a lot of suffering among civilians with an adversary like Hamas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=309.56s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, thank you again for being our guest [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=316.28s)]
*  and for your service. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=320.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLJ-0h3OU8A&t=323.36s)]
