# Jonathan Lemire's 'The Big Lie' Out Today
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ)
*  Trump today returns to Washington for the first time since leaving office on Biden's inauguration day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He is still telling lies about 2020 and beyond. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=6.48s)]
*  We as Americans now face another election season where we can't even agree on the same set of facts. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=11.28s)]
*  How worrisome is that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=19.12s)]
*  Oh, it's, you know, any democracy that does not have the ability to engage in reasoned deliberation [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=21.12s)]
*  about matters that face the citizenry is in trouble. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  If we can't agree on the background conditions that allow us to debate, democracy is in trouble. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=34.56s)]
*  And so, you know, that last line in the book, I don't want to give it away, Jonathan, but I will. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=40.72s)]
*  Please do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=45.76s)]
*  The big lie was who they were. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=47.28s)]
*  The big lie was who they were. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=50.08s)]
*  And you tell the story as you talk about the accumulation of the lie and how the Republican [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Party basically concedes to it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=57.92s)]
*  If that is true, that the Republican Party has now been consumed, it has metastasized, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  the big lie has metastasized such that it's taken over the party, then it becomes very difficult [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=65.6s)]
*  to imagine how this particular political actor, that political institution called the Republican [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=70.16s)]
*  Party fits within the workings of democracy itself. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=75.44s)]
*  So, I mean, it's a harrowing and haunting story that really should raise our eyebrows, at least, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=78.64s)]
*  should call us to attention, at best, to what is before us come this political season. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1QZO98YlPQ&t=86.56s)]
