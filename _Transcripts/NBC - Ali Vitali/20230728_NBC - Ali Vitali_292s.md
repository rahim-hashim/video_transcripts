# House GOP starts August recess early despite shutdown deadlines
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY)
*  House Republicans, meanwhile, have announced with all that going on, they're going to have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=0.0s)]
*  an early start to their August recess, forcing Congress to push back passage of crucial spending [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=4.34s)]
*  bills. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  The House will leave for a six-week break, returning in September with just over two [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  weeks left to pass a laundry list of measures to avoid a government shutdown. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=15.38s)]
*  Eleven out of 12 spending bills need to pass before a September 30th deadline. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=20.34s)]
*  House Republicans were forced to cancel scheduled votes after internal discord between GOP factions [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=27.14s)]
*  made it obvious that, well, they just simply wouldn't have the numbers to pass the bills. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=33.34s)]
*  Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries slammed the GOP for the early recess. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=38.42s)]
*  Well, the extreme mega Republicans are marching the American people and the Congress toward [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=42.46s)]
*  a government shutdown. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=49.58s)]
*  It's in their DNA. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=51.72s)]
*  Extreme mega Republicans have shut down the government repeatedly to try to extract extreme [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=53.94s)]
*  ransom demands from the Congress in order to jam their extreme right-wing ideology down [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=60.16s)]
*  the throats of the American people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=68.2s)]
*  And that's the moment that we're in right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=70.46s)]
*  Joining us now, co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=75.02s)]
*  She is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=78.25999999999999s)]
*  Let's start with the defense bill gets done. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=81.14s)]
*  But give us an update. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=83.26s)]
*  Tell us how the blockade by Senator Tuberville is playing into all of this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=84.42s)]
*  Has there been any progress made there? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=89.5s)]
*  I should note, President Biden last night, an event here in Washington, delivered some [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  of his sharpest criticisms yet of that senator and what he's doing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=95.18s)]
*  We've been covering this really closely. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=100.7s)]
*  This is an unprecedented hold on military promotions, more than 300 promotions at this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=102.66000000000001s)]
*  point. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  There had been some hope among senators and certainly the Pentagon that they would be [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=109.78s)]
*  able to come to some kind of compromise before the August recess. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=113.06s)]
*  Often this is the time when the deals get done. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=116.54s)]
*  Right now there's no deal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=119.7s)]
*  Despite the fact that the Pentagon chief and Tuberville had multiple conversations, this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=121.66s)]
*  is not going anywhere. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=127.18s)]
*  So far the Republican Alabama is holding firm and it will be at least another month until [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=128.62s)]
*  there is some kind of a deal that could move some of these promotions forward. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=134.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=137.98s)]
*  And certainly it's setting up a very busy September there on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=138.48s)]
*  So talk to us about what the House is doing, the early recess. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=143.9s)]
*  They certainly have no shortage of things they have to do when they get back. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=147.46s)]
*  And how likely do you think it is that we are heading for a government shutdown of some [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=151.3s)]
*  sort? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=156.18s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's an empty threat. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=157.18s)]
*  I think if you look at even this latest defense authorization bill and the fact that where [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=159.82s)]
*  the Senate is and where the House is are just two totally different places. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=164.18s)]
*  And so far it's unclear exactly what House Republicans are going to want. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=169.58s)]
*  A lot of them, particularly in the conservative faction, don't believe a shutdown would be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  that big of a deal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  They don't think that that many Republicans across the country would even notice necessarily [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=179.62s)]
*  if a shutdown happens. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=183.98000000000002s)]
*  And so this is going to be Speaker Kevin McCarthy's biggest test by far. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  Can he find a place where he can understand what exactly House Republicans want and try [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=189.74s)]
*  to do some deal making? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=194.02s)]
*  But right now we are going very, very close to a government shutdown. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=195.22s)]
*  A lot of folks, particularly at Punchbowl News, believe because of reporting that we [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=198.9s)]
*  will actually have a shutdown in September unless something changes pretty dramatically. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=203.46s)]
*  White House aides, girding for it as well. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=208.34s)]
*  They seem confident that the House Republicans will take the blame. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=210.3s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=213.74s)]
*  And lastly, we started the show on the latest legal woes facing Donald Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=214.74s)]
*  Give us a quick sense of what the reaction has been from members of his party. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=221.04000000000002s)]
*  Are these at the same chorus of voices rushing to his defense and declaring this is all [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=225.12s)]
*  some sort of deep state conspiracy? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=230.36s)]
*  I don't think there's been any break in support for the folks that are still behind the former [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=232.08s)]
*  president. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=237.56s)]
*  House Republicans in particular have long been the defenders of Trump. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=238.56s)]
*  And I think you continue to see that same chorus. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  There's not going to be, I think, any break anytime soon. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=246.16s)]
*  They kind of think this is the same thing just another day and that the deep state kind [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=248.56s)]
*  of DOJ is against Republicans and certainly against the former president. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, certainly those Republicans on Capitol Hill also now have to add worries about Mitch [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=258.44s)]
*  McConnell's health to their list of things to be concerned about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=262.8s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer, thank you as always. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=267.52s)]
*  We will speak to you again soon. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgw5lsxYKxY&t=270.24s)]
