# Biden set to deliver farewell address tonight
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY)
*  President Biden will deliver a farewell address to the nation tonight from the Oval Office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House has not released many details about what the president will discuss in his [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=4.8s)]
*  remarks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=8.24s)]
*  They're scheduled for 8 p.m. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=9.24s)]
*  Eastern. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=10.24s)]
*  But according to sources, Biden is expected to reflect on his decades of service to the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=11.24s)]
*  country and will also include a message to Americans about the country's future. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=14.92s)]
*  Joining us now is White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Emily Simons. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=19.64s)]
*  So we know the White House hasn't released many details, but you are the White House. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=23.38s)]
*  Talk to us about what we should be expecting to hear from the president tonight. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=27.1s)]
*  So tonight, the president will be honoring a time honored tradition, sitting behind the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=30.62s)]
*  Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, addressing millions of Americans, really putting us in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  the moment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=39.46s)]
*  Where are we as a country right now? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=40.46s)]
*  What can we expect going forward? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=42.18s)]
*  As you mentioned, he'll be drawing on his 50 years of public service, four in the White [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=44.86s)]
*  House, eight as vice president, 36 as a senator, and really culminating in this moment of who [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=49.6s)]
*  we are today, who we are as Americans and that we are stronger when we are united. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=56.78s)]
*  We'll hear a lot about all of the accomplishments we've had, everything from lowering [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=62.38s)]
*  prescription drug costs, all of the work on our roads and bridges, especially the work [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=67.02s)]
*  we've done in the tech space, cybersecurity and semiconductor chips. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=72.66s)]
*  What this means for our place in the world, both national security and domestic security [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=78.26s)]
*  going forward. Yeah, certainly a lot of work in that chip space as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=82.78s)]
*  That's going to have a long tail. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=86.06s)]
*  There's also the other piece of this, though, too, that there is some criticism from within [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=87.86s)]
*  the party about the way that Biden stayed in this race and about now Donald Trump coming [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=91.58s)]
*  in for a second term. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=97.86s)]
*  Do you think that there's anything in this speech that grapples with either those criticisms [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=99.58s)]
*  or bucking them? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  We are focused on everything that we have delivered and explaining that to the American [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=105.66s)]
*  people. Right now, there are 72000 projects underway across the country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  On our roads and bridges and ports and waterways, airports. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=116.38s)]
*  These are things that are going to make a real difference to everyday people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=120.38s)]
*  There's also a lot of work that's being done in a historic way. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=123.98s)]
*  The biggest single drop in opioid deaths ever. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=127.7s)]
*  Lowest border encounters, biggest crime drop in 50 years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=131.94s)]
*  This type of thing makes a really big difference to people in every corner of the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=135.94s)]
*  Doesn't matter if you're a Republican, if you're a Democrat. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=140.26s)]
*  This has been a president that has spoken and fought for all Americans. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=142.74s)]
*  The other piece of this, too, when I think about Joe Biden in covering the 2020 race is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=146.54s)]
*  the whole frame was the battle for the soul of a nation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=150.82s)]
*  Democracy, small d, was so central to that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=153.42s)]
*  Is that going to be something that we hear him talk about, especially as he talks about [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=156.7s)]
*  the future? This is a president who has restored honor, decency, character to the White [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=160.54s)]
*  House. You see it in everything he does. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=167.18s)]
*  And I think you will hear directly from him about the importance of those attributes, what [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=171.22s)]
*  it does for us, not just at home, these are the Americans, but also what it really can do [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=176.26s)]
*  for us on the world stage. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=180.94s)]
*  The strengthening of our alliances. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  So much of it is because the president has these longstanding relationships everywhere [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  between the Indo-Pacific, Ukraine, Europe and the Middle East. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=189.26s)]
*  And that work is ongoing now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=193.66s)]
*  But when you have someone with that heart, that character in the Oval, it makes a big [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=196.42s)]
*  difference. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=201.78s)]
*  I think the other thing I'm thinking about, too, is the fact that Biden will be having the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=202.42s)]
*  Trumps over for the more traditional pre-inauguration meetings. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=207.26s)]
*  Of course, he will be going to the inauguration. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  All of these things not afforded to him by the man who is now being re-inaugurated after [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=214.22s)]
*  him. How is he thinking about what's happening on Monday, the transition of power and the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=218.94s)]
*  role that he's playing in sort of re-traditionalizing something that felt bent severely, if not [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=223.3s)]
*  almost broken back in 2021? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=230.18s)]
*  So the edict that we have had directly from the president as his staff is to ensure we [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=233.26s)]
*  have a peaceful, orderly transition of power. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=238.34s)]
*  That is what the American people deserve. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=242.02s)]
*  And that is exactly what we are doing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=243.82s)]
*  We are working closely with our counterparts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=245.86s)]
*  We are exchanging information as appropriate and we will ensure that Monday [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=248.22s)]
*  inauguration is a peaceful transfer of power and follows by the book all the things that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=253.89999999999998s)]
*  are typically done, the inaugural tea, the joint motorcade folding in together and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=259.98s)]
*  ultimately that passing to a new administration as is written in the Constitution. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=265.58s)]
*  And then after Monday, he is a private citizen, something that he has not been since 30 [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=271.74s)]
*  years ago. Plus, when he was elected to the Senate, what's next for him? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=277.26000000000005s)]
*  Is he going to be active? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=281.66s)]
*  He is going to be active. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=283.14000000000004s)]
*  He has told us we are going to hear from him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=285.66s)]
*  I'm sure you're loving that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=288.82000000000005s)]
*  We are. You know, he's a family man. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=290.82000000000005s)]
*  I think throughout this presidency, he spent a lot of time with his family. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=293.54s)]
*  He's going to continue doing that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  He has a new great grandchild. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=297.3s)]
*  But I think he is extremely committed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  He's a lifelong public servant and he is going to continue doing what he can on the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=302.26000000000005s)]
*  behalf of this nation, speaking to important events and we'll be hearing from him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=307.18s)]
*  Yeah, 40 years. You don't just quit cold turkey overnight. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=312.66s)]
*  Emily Simons, White House senior deputy press secretary. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=315.58s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdUyzFvXuPY&t=318.14s)]
