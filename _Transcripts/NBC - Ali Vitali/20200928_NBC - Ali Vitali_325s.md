# Head Of 'Voter Protection' Fund On Possible November Outcomes | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 28, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8)
*  Welcome back. Now at the Pentagon, there are concerns over whether President Trump would [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=0.0s)]
*  pull the military into the potential chaos and unrest surrounding any transfer of political [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=7.44s)]
*  power. According to a New York Times report, senior leaders who spoke on the condition [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=13.36s)]
*  of anonymity said they were weighing options if Trump invokes the Insurrection Act and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=17.88s)]
*  tries to send troops into the streets after the elections, just as he threatened to do [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=23.66s)]
*  during protests against police brutality and systemic racism. According to the report, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=29.0s)]
*  if that happens, Pentagon officials say there could be resignations among many of the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=34.56s)]
*  administration's senior generals, starting at the top with General Mark Milley, who's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=39.08s)]
*  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joining me now is the founder of the National [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=44.0s)]
*  Voter Protection Action Fund, Donald Calloway. Don, good morning. Thank you so much for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=49.24s)]
*  getting up early. It is always great to see you. This obviously part was a story that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=54.88s)]
*  we were so focused on last week and is one that is going to continue as House leaders [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=61.92s)]
*  plan. Nancy Pelosi in particular is planning to try and make sure they're ready if there [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  is an electoral college tie. What's your view and how do you think Democrats should be preparing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=75.08s)]
*  for all of these possibilities, ranging from a peaceful political and legal fight that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=82.56s)]
*  went to the House all the way up to what apparently the Pentagon is planning for? Yeah, well, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=88.16s)]
*  there's a couple of things at play here. First of all, Democrats need to be planning for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=93.76s)]
*  an overwhelming voter turnout, which is the only thing that could put this election out [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=98.28s)]
*  of any form of doubt. So all Democrats across the board should be encouraging people to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=103.0s)]
*  not only look at this as election day, but as an election period up to an election month. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=109.24s)]
*  Based upon your state's rules, you should be making a plan to vote and you have not done your [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=114.44s)]
*  part if you plan to vote, but only if you have helped your entire community make a plan to vote. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=118.52s)]
*  Folks need to be very in tune with their state's election rules from voting early, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=123.32s)]
*  participating somehow early in the process that does not completely rely upon the United States [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=127.96s)]
*  mail because we know what Louis DeJoy has done in terms of removing voting machines and tampering [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  with that process. So our recommendation from the National Voter Protection Action Fund, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=138.44s)]
*  what I'm hearing from Democratic operatives across the board is that people need to mask up social [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=142.52s)]
*  distance and vote early, be it early absentee or just no excuse absentee or early voting. But [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  a voting person, if possible, if you receive a mail-in ballot and you can take that and return [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=152.04s)]
*  it in person, you should probably do that. But I'm encouraging as many people as can to participate [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=156.6s)]
*  long ahead of November 3rd. Now, what really worries me, Casey, is if you consider that the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=163.16s)]
*  president has had no respect for democratic norms or democracy from day one when he descended down [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=169.32s)]
*  that staircase, we can expect that behavior to continue. And it was cute when it was all about [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=174.6s)]
*  tweets and unconventional language, but now it threatens the actual foundations of democracy [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=179.0s)]
*  with the peaceful transition of power. And the problem is that his people, the boogaloo's and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=183.72s)]
*  the folks who believe the rhetoric that he's been saying, the very dangerous stuff are going to need [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=189.8s)]
*  to feel acutely wronged. He's already laid the groundwork for that in multiple ways by calling [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=194.12s)]
*  it a rigged election, by saying there's ballots found in rivers. Of course it's nonsensical, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=199.0s)]
*  but his people have believed the nonsense from day one. So I can expect that there will be [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  substantial disruptions on election day and after, once he claims that this election was stolen. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=208.12s)]
*  The guys we saw screaming at Gretchen Whitmer at the state legislature in Michigan, the guys we saw [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  hanging governor Beshear in Kentucky in effigy. Those are the same folks that we can expect to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  be in the streets protesting with long guns once this president claims that he was wronged. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=225.96s)]
*  And I can only expect that there will be hopefully not disastrous consequences. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=232.12s)]
*  What states in particular quickly are you looking at? We've heard a lot of focus on Pennsylvania, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=239.56s)]
*  for example, but as you guys have sat down and looked across the map and focused on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=245.64s)]
*  your voter protection efforts, what are the places we're going to be talking about on election night [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  and the day after and the day after that? Sure, you're looking at states that have a history of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  voter suppression and have places where we can expect it to be close such that voter suppression [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  would make a difference. Pennsylvania, particularly in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=263.0s)]
*  Wisconsin, particularly 30,000 black Wisconsin's who were shut out of voting processes in 2016. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  I expect that Georgia will be a major place. Stacey Abrams and Fair Fight and New Georgia [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=273.96s)]
*  Project have done tremendous for over the last 10 years, but we don't know whether those votes [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=278.03999999999996s)]
*  will continue to be suppressed or not. So we're looking to get another round of funding down to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=281.88s)]
*  Georgia and Missouri where you have a surprisingly close governor's race that will turn largely on [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=285.96s)]
*  turnout and African-American participation in getting over those voter suppression hurdles. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=291.4s)]
*  So we're looking at several states, but particularly those four come to mind as being [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  major potential voter suppression grounds because of the close races there this November. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=300.12s)]
*  All right, Don Calloway, it's always great to see you, my friend, and thank you so much for [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7ePLBPMT8&t=307.32s)]
