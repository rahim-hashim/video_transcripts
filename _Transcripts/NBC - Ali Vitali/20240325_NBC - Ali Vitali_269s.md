# Why Mike Johnson can't run the House without help from Democrats
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE)
*  There's a new piece in the Wall Street Journal that highlights the existential challenge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=0.0s)]
*  that House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing not from Democrats, but from fellow MAGA Republicans [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=4.12s)]
*  in Congress. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=9.6s)]
*  The paper spells out how Speaker Johnson cannot currently run the House without real help [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=10.86s)]
*  from Democrats in the form of a bipartisan coalition that has been needed to pass key [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=15.18s)]
*  bills including last week's long overdue government funding bill. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=20.44s)]
*  What's more, the GOP's thin majority is putting the party's agenda at risk as some embittered [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=25.16s)]
*  Republicans including Marjorie Taylor Greene took an initial step on Friday to try to oust [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=30.28s)]
*  Johnson as Speaker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=35.56s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the co-authors of that piece, Capitol Hill reporter for the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=37.4s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, Siobhan Hughes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=40.92s)]
*  Siobhan, good morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  So it is an unlikely coalition in some ways. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=44.0s)]
*  Democrats need to bail out Johnson again and again. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=47.36s)]
*  Talk to us, if you will, about that odd dynamic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=49.92s)]
*  Well, the interesting thing about this is that this is a coalition that Johnson has [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=53.12s)]
*  really helped create because he is bringing bills to the floor, avoiding his own people [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  under a tactic that requires him to get two-thirds of the entire House. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=64.08s)]
*  He of course has barely half of the House, and so anytime he wants to do anything big, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=68.68s)]
*  he is in essence saying, Democrats, come join me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=73.32s)]
*  I am going to get around the far right of my conference and we are going to bowl straight [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=76.8s)]
*  down the middle, which of course is exactly what Chuck Schumer has been saying he should [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=81.7s)]
*  do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=84.94s)]
*  So we mentioned earlier in the show about this oust effort by Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=86.34s)]
*  and others potentially to push Johnson out. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=90.78s)]
*  What is your read in terms of sources you have been talking to over the weekend there? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  I know Congress should know Congress is about to go away on a two-week recess. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=96.62s)]
*  How real is this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=101.14s)]
*  Is this just simply the far right kind of like sending a warning shot or do we think [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=102.94s)]
*  there could be a real effort to push him out? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  Before we get to whether or not he is going to be pushed out, what you need to think about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=109.98s)]
*  is the year 2015 when John Boehner was ousted almost in this exact same manner. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=113.58s)]
*  A motion to vacate was never called up in that instance, and that is the parallel here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=120.02s)]
*  These next two weeks are going to be crucial because this is going to be about can Republicans [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=124.74s)]
*  rally around somebody else? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=129.4s)]
*  Does anybody emerge as a contender? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=131.06s)]
*  Do Republicans think that this would be such a bad vote for them that they start asking [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=134.34s)]
*  Mike Johnson to step down? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=139.78s)]
*  That is exactly what happened in 2015. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=141.98s)]
*  All over the conservative airwaves people were saying do you support John Boehner? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  Republicans being interviewed had to answer and that is what we are watching for right [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=149.54s)]
*  now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=152.78s)]
*  This certainly hands the Democrats such an election year issue here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=153.78s)]
*  President Biden has been talking about the dysfunction in the Republican House for a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=159.34s)]
*  long time, but House Democrats feel like they could really flip the chamber. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=162.62s)]
*  This surely can only help. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=165.3s)]
*  It could help them flip the chamber if it points to chaos, and of course we are going [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=168.02s)]
*  to have some test points here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=172.1s)]
*  This isn't just an ethereal or conceptual issue. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=173.42s)]
*  This is going to intersect with Mike Johnson's drive to pass aid to Ukraine and of course [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=176.4s)]
*  to renew the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which governs U.S. spying powers. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=182.5s)]
*  This coalition is kind of telling Mike Johnson you are on probation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=187.88s)]
*  If you do anything we don't like on Ukraine or FISA we are pulling the ripcord and it's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=193.0s)]
*  going to be a very tense next month. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=197.64s)]
*  You just led me to my last question, Siobhan. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=200.28s)]
*  What is the future of a Ukraine funding bill? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  This is going to be a very tricky situation and two pathways forward here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=210.0s)]
*  Either a discharge petition which seems a little bit less likely, more of a forcing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  mechanism, and then once again this option of Mike Johnson doing something with Democrats [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  to get two-thirds of the House. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  This is really, really threading a needle with a very small eye. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  We should underscore, I just mentioned reports right now about air raid sirens over a number [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  of Ukrainian cities including the capital of Kyiv underscoring the need for this funding [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=234.88s)]
*  to come from Washington. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=240.0s)]
*  We will be keeping an eye on the building behind you there. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  Capitol Hill reporter for the Wall Street Journal Siobhan Hughes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=246.68s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5HG6imQaJE&t=247.68s)]
