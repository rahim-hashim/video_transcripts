# 'A complete slap in the face': House Democrat rips Trump spending bill
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4)
*  Joining us now straight from the House floor, Democratic Congressman Morgan McGarvey of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=0.0s)]
*  Kentucky. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=3.24s)]
*  He's a member of the House Budget Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=4.24s)]
*  You've already had a long night, and I know that we're sort of on the clock for whenever [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=5.24s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries stops speaking and this actual vote goes on. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=8.2s)]
*  But take us inside the mood on the floor right now among Democrats and if there's any conversation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=11.8s)]
*  with Republicans between the parties. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=16.48s)]
*  Democrats are still fighting, and obviously we're frustrated. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=19.16s)]
*  This matters to us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=21.92s)]
*  This is more than policy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=23.04s)]
*  Look at my state of Kentucky. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=24.92s)]
*  These aren't just numbers, right? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  35 rural hospitals are going to close in my state if these cuts go through. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=28.44s)]
*  That means people who live in rural America right now, I got a text message from a woman [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=32.04s)]
*  named Donna. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=35.64s)]
*  She says, we drive 30 minutes right now to get to the hospital. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=36.64s)]
*  If the closest hospital closes, when it closes, and when someone gets sick, when someone [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=39.44s)]
*  has a heart attack, when someone has a stroke, and minutes matter, they're driving an additional [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=44.28s)]
*  30, 40, 50 minutes to get to a hospital. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=48.52s)]
*  This is the difference between life and death. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=52.66s)]
*  This is why Democrats are fighting. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=54.78s)]
*  This is why Jeffries is on the floor right now fighting because this matters. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=56.26s)]
*  It really is going to have an impact on people's lives. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=60.26s)]
*  And this vote, although we expect it to pass, is going to be close because the margins when [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  the House are as close as they are. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=66.64s)]
*  But we've actually spent a lot of time focusing on Kentucky Republicans because Rand Paul, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=68.7s)]
*  Thomas Massey on the House side have been some of the more outspoken members against [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=73.1s)]
*  their party, against the president on this bill. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=77.34s)]
*  Why Kentucky? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=80.84s)]
*  Bring us inside the dynamics of your state and why this bill could be so detrimental [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=82.1s)]
*  that these two Republicans would buck their party in an era where we don't really see [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  that very much. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=90.58s)]
*  Well, this bill is a complete slap in the face to Kentuckians. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=91.58s)]
*  Yes, 35 rural hospitals are going to close more than any other state. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=94.41999999999999s)]
*  133,000 rural Kentuckians will be kicked off their health insurance more than any other [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=97.89999999999999s)]
*  state. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=102.41999999999999s)]
*  Kentucky will lose $10 billion in rural Medicaid reimbursements more than any other state. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=103.41999999999999s)]
*  I served in the Kentucky State Senate for 10 years before coming to Congress. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  I can tell you we get more money every year as a state and federal Medicaid dollars than [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=111.62s)]
*  the entirety of the Kentucky state budget. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  Now, I don't know if that is Senator Paul's or Congressman Massey's objection to the bill, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=118.42s)]
*  but they're doing all this and they are hurting Kentuckians. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=123.54s)]
*  I mean, every day, hardworking things, they're hurting Kentuckians and they're doing it while [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=125.86s)]
*  giving the richest Americans a huge tax break and driving up the national debt by trillions [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=130.82s)]
*  and trillions of dollars. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=135.9s)]
*  And so, you know, with Senator Paul, with Congressman Massey, they've been, you know, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=137.9s)]
*  pretty steadfast since they've been here, given consistency points that they don't want [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=141.78s)]
*  the nation to go further into debt. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  This bill drives the nation further into debt, just like it did the first time Donald Trump [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=147.68s)]
*  did this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=151.78s)]
*  And people don't bring that up. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=152.78s)]
*  We have a blueprint to look at. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=153.78s)]
*  Donald Trump has done this before. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=155.18s)]
*  It drove the nation further into debt. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=156.82s)]
*  He's doing it again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=158.5s)]
*  It will drive the nation even more into debt. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=159.5s)]
*  Yeah, you're talking about those 2017 tax cuts, which even when they were passed at [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=161.34s)]
*  the time were projected to add to the national deficit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=165.02s)]
*  Now, these are the same tax cuts that are being extended. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  And so when Republicans are talking about it's a tax cut, it's not a new tax cut. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=170.86s)]
*  It's an extension and it's a stopping of those tax cuts from going away from basically doing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=174.9s)]
*  an accidental tax hike because they couldn't extend those cuts. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=179.72s)]
*  We expect them to be able to do that here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=183.82000000000002s)]
*  We see, for example, that Thomas Massey is then earning the ire of the president, saying [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=185.88s)]
*  he's going to push primary challengers against him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=189.5s)]
*  You have the district next to his. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  I imagine your TV is going to be full of ads. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=193.06s)]
*  But have you talked to Republicans about these concerns? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you even hear it from some of them voicing the fact that they don't think that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=197.94s)]
*  this is great policy, but the political dynamics are such that they're not pushing back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=201.66s)]
*  I mean, have you had bipartisan conversations about this bill? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=205.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the things I really hate about this is behind closed doors, Republicans [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=208.5s)]
*  know this is bad. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  They know it's going to drive the debt up. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=214.58s)]
*  They know who these taxes benefit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=216.0s)]
*  It's the richest Americans. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=217.66s)]
*  in rural states, it's really going to hurt people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=219.7s)]
*  But then they don't have the courage to do and say in public what they're saying in private. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=223.5s)]
*  And all we need, why we're continuing to fight, all we need are four Republicans to have the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=228.22s)]
*  backbone to stand up and say this bill is not ready for prime time, which Lisa Murkowski [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=232.5s)]
*  already did say out loud. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=237.62s)]
*  Even after she voted for it's not ready from prime time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  Let's go back to the table. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=241.92s)]
*  Let's get this thing right. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=243.01999999999998s)]
*  As we wrap up here and go to a quick break and get you back to the House floor, how do [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=244.02s)]
*  Democrats continue to extend this in the minds of Americans? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=248.62s)]
*  A year before the midterms is a really long time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=251.86s)]
*  What's the plan and how has the caucus talked about this? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=255.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, how we're talking about this is look, what they did in this bill, they [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=257.66s)]
*  are helping the richest Americans get even richer. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=262.22s)]
*  If there's anything even for anybody else, it's not permanent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=264.48s)]
*  But beyond the messaging, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=267.52s)]
*  I mean, like, what is the forum to keep this front of mind? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=268.86s)]
*  I think we will continue using every form imaginable, whether it's social media, whether [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=271.62s)]
*  it's earned media, whether it's getting on TV, whether it's going into communities. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  I had a town hall Monday night this week for a pop-up town hall on Medicaid. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=277.9s)]
*  And I mean, tons of people showed up just because they want to share their stories. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  This is not about numbers on a sheet. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  This is not about some policy that's foreign in Washington. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=289.18s)]
*  I can tell you, when you come to Kentucky, when you see the rural hospitals, it will [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=292.78s)]
*  close. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=295.86s)]
*  The people who will lose their health insurance, the people for whom this is life or death, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=296.86s)]
*  and we're going to continue to tell those stories. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=300.92s)]
*  Congressman, we'll let you get back to the floor, though you do still see Hakeem Jeffries [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=302.6s)]
*  speaking there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=306.52s)]
*  That gives you a little bit of time to get back to where you need to be. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=307.52s)]
*  But thank you for stopping in with us and talking about this bill. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=310.48s)]
*  Congressman Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky, we'll see you again soon, I'm sure. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rnX_CYGKT4&t=312.72s)]
