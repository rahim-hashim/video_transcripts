# Movement within GOP to stop Trump melting away: Axios
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc)
*  Donald Trump may soon visit the US Capitol in an effort to help House Republicans elect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=0.0s)]
*  a new speaker and unify the party. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=5.72s)]
*  Sources are telling NBC News the former president may visit the Capitol early next week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=8.4s)]
*  If he does, it would be his first time there since the January 6th insurrection. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=13.52s)]
*  This potential visit comes as a few Republicans have suggested that Trump run for speaker [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=19.6s)]
*  himself. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  You don't have to be a member of the House to be speaker. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  While the GOP frontrunner says he's remaining committed to running for president, he did [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  entertain the idea for a little while yesterday, but then a short time later endorsed Jim [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=32.72s)]
*  Jordan for speaker, but also offered to step in to speaker temporarily if the Republicans [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=36.92s)]
*  can't decide on a new leader. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=41.8s)]
*  Basically, who knows? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=43.56s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional reporter for Axios, Sophia Kai. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=45.32s)]
*  Maybe she can provide some answers. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=48.4s)]
*  So Sophia, what is the thinking here, if there is any, from Trump camp about this potential [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=49.96s)]
*  visit to the Capitol? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=55.68s)]
*  Does he actually want to step in to be speaker? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=56.92s)]
*  Is this just an effort to gain attention, to distract from his legal issues? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  And isn't there some risk involved if he goes there and starts whipping votes for Jim Jordan, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=63.56s)]
*  but Jordan can't get to the magic number? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=68.72s)]
*  Yeah, so here's the thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=71.12s)]
*  He loves to sow chaos. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=74.92s)]
*  He also loves to insert himself into the news. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=77.0s)]
*  He's been sitting there and reveling in the four days of back-to-back coverage. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=80.4s)]
*  And so even if he does not ultimately pursue the speaker, which I really don't think that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=85.9s)]
*  he's seriously considering, and even if he doesn't go to the Capitol, which, you know, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=91.9s)]
*  that is a more serious idea. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=96.66s)]
*  And someone close to him told me last night that he is the closest as he's ever been to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=98.82s)]
*  returning to the Capitol for the first time since January 6th. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=104.14s)]
*  And so I think the thinking is he wants to show that he is still the face of the Republican [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=108.8s)]
*  Party and that he will get the nomination. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=112.74s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly, you know, he's desperate for attention. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=115.22s)]
*  And yes, if he were to go there, unify the party, that just cements himself that much [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=119.97999999999999s)]
*  further as being the face of the GOP. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=123.74s)]
*  But there's some risks involved, too. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=126.46s)]
*  So let's turn to your new story this morning, Sophia, about the sort of never-Trump movement [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=128.42s)]
*  within inside the GOP that, you know, is frankly faltering, is melting away with Trump in such [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=133.38s)]
*  a commanding position in all of the early polls. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=139.98s)]
*  Tell us more about it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=144.42s)]
*  Yeah, so we've got a couple of data points here that show change, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=145.42s)]
*  You've got a Club for Growth affiliated PAC that recently told donors that they spent [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=150.3s)]
*  $6 million testing 40 anti-Trump messages, and none of them have worked. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=155.3s)]
*  You've got another PAC, Republican Accountability PAC, that announced that it's going to stop [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=161.74s)]
*  spending money in the Republican primary. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=167.66s)]
*  It's going to turn its attention to the general. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=170.02s)]
*  And so you've got also people who are not really Trump fans, people like Brian Kemp. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=173.86s)]
*  He has recently said that if Trump does win the nomination, then, you know, Brian Kemp [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=179.54s)]
*  would support him. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  And all of these things are really just indications that the Republican Party has what I like [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=185.96s)]
*  to call Trump inevitability setting in. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=192.66s)]
*  And that's kind of a reality that they've turned around to in the last couple of months, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=197.02s)]
*  whether they like it or not. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=204.3s)]
*  And lastly, Sophia, tell us about the state of Governor Ron DeSantis' campaign, who for [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=206.3s)]
*  so long was considered the leading Trump alternative. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=211.24s)]
*  His campaign launch has been nothing short of disastrous, slipping in the polls. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=214.78s)]
*  He had an event in Florida yesterday with some sheriffs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=218.46s)]
*  That's a team that's desperate for a real reset, a real reboot. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=221.9s)]
*  Are there any signs that's happening? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=226.54s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know yet, John, about that one, because they've been struggling with attendance [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=229.34s)]
*  at some of their events. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=236.3s)]
*  We know the biggest sign of change in terms of the money support is that some of his biggest [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=238.26s)]
*  donors, including Robert Bigelow, including Ken Griffin, these are people who spent tens [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=245.5s)]
*  of millions of dollars on Ron DeSantis previously or for his gubernatorial run. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=251.06s)]
*  And they've both paused their support, at least for now, saying that they either don't [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  agree with the strategy or they just don't see him as a viable candidate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  And so we know that deep pocketed donors, they're still giving DeSantis and Haley a [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=265.5s)]
*  look, but they're really trying to decide if at all it is worth putting their money [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  behind another alternative. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=277.74s)]
*  All right, Congressional reporter for Axiom, Saviakai. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=279.94s)]
*  A lot of good reporting this morning. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=282.06s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORr6zo42cc&t=283.5s)]
