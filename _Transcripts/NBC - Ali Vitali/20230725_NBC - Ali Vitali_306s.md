# GOP trying to use crime, immigration, inflation to attack Biden
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU)
*  Republicans are trying to use crime, immigration, and inflation to attack President Joe Biden, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=0.0s)]
*  but it appears that those numbers are trending in the White House's favor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=6.16s)]
*  During the pandemic, violent crime indeed surged in major cities, but now studies show that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=10.48s)]
*  homicides were down, were down 9% this year. Illegal border crossings have also dropped to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=15.6s)]
*  the lowest level in over two years, and inflation has been slowly but surely retreating, signaling [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  that the economy is improving. The Biden administration is now touting all those numbers [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=28.16s)]
*  in hopes of raising the president's middling approval ratings. Joining us now, co-founder [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=33.28s)]
*  of Axios, Mike Allen. This was an Axios, really smart Axios story about these, at least for now, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=38.64s)]
*  faltering Republican attacks. Tell us a little bit more about it. Yeah, Jonathan, hello. You're [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=44.56s)]
*  wearing even more hats this week than usual, and here's a problem for Republicans. They talk about [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=48.8s)]
*  Joe Biden's America as if it's like Halloween, right? Cue the scary music, but as you point out [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=55.28s)]
*  on the issues where the president has been vulnerable, the stats are going the wrong way. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=61.92s)]
*  We all know that inflation is better, border is somewhat better compared to where it had been [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=67.52s)]
*  and where it has been projected. Violent crime is still higher than it was in 2019, but it's down. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=72.48s)]
*  So in the White House, they're saying, finally, and you hear it every day, very frustrated [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=79.36s)]
*  by not getting credit for what they see as much better reality than perceptions, because Jonathan, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=86.24s)]
*  the perceptions are still terrible. You know this, any poll of like, how do you feel about America? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=92.72s)]
*  Like, right track, wrong track. However you want to measure it, the president is not getting credit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  So this is his effort to take binomics originally a slower from the right to own it and say, look, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=103.28s)]
*  the reality is much better than you feel. Yeah, there's no question he's been very aggressive [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=109.92s)]
*  pushing those good economic numbers, and yes, to the border, Title 42 when it went away, there [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=114.16s)]
*  wasn't that surge that so many people anticipated. So Axios also has some new reporting about how [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=118.88s)]
*  House Republicans privately expect a spending fight this fall, likely October, to trigger a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=124.0s)]
*  government shutdown. Tell us. Yeah, Jonathan, I feel like a little bit this is the déjà vu. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=130.4s)]
*  Yes. We have Speaker McCarthy talking about impeachment. We have Republicans talking about [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  a shutdown, but here's what's happening. By the end of September, Republicans need to pass 12 [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  spending bills. The right wing of Speaker McCarthy's caucus, which doesn't want more spending, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=146.24s)]
*  is going to resist. So you have a couple things going on. One, just getting Congress to do 12 [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  things on a given timeline, very difficult to do. But Republicans are making their job [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=159.84s)]
*  different because what are they doing? They're loading up these must pass bills with measures [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=164.48s)]
*  like abortion, other sort of message type bills that they're trying to force tough votes on. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=170.4s)]
*  So you have that. The Republicans don't want to pass it all at once. You can sweep all 12 bills [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=177.12s)]
*  into an omnibus. And one of my favorite Washington words, Jonathan, if you can't get an omnibus and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=184.08s)]
*  you can maybe put a few of them together, can you get a minibus? So there's talk about that. And, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=190.4s)]
*  of course, what could Congress do to avoid a shutdown? And we've got to pause and say, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=196.24s)]
*  why that matters. Furloughed workers, possibly lost services for people in America who need the most [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=201.28s)]
*  close national parks. It's pain. It's suffering. But what could Congress do? You well know they [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=208.4s)]
*  could, but they could give themselves more time. They often do it. It's your right to underscore [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=213.84s)]
*  it's not just a political ploy. There are real world implications here. But in terms of the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=218.08s)]
*  politics, the White House thinks that the Republicans would own the blame for this shutdown [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=221.6s)]
*  in particular. Mike, we want to hit one more for you. So we've been covering all show about how [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump's legal woes are mounting. We may have another indictment in a matter of days. And we [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=229.36s)]
*  start looking at his trial dates and you've compared calendars, trial dates and political [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=233.36s)]
*  dates. Tell us. Yes. So you have the campaign and these trials colliding. So I think we might be [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=238.24s)]
*  able to show it to you. There's a graphic on Axios. When you put the dates together, you start to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=243.52s)]
*  realize what uncharted territory we're in. So you see that there's one trial literally the day of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=249.12s)]
*  the Iowa caucuses. Then you have another couple trials. Then you have Super Tuesday. So, Jonathan, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=254.4s)]
*  the bottom line of this as scheduled now, you could have five trials, three civil, two criminal [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=260.32s)]
*  before the Republican convention. Yeah. And right there on your screen, you can see how they match [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=266.8s)]
*  up a very complicated campaign for Donald Trump, one that his Republican opponents, and certainly [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  the White House looks at and says that's going to be a problem for him. Let's get out of the way. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=278.24s)]
*  Mike Allen, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=282.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeDxhkw6QFU&t=290.32s)]
