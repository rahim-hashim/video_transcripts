# FBI employees ordered to detail their work on any Jan. 6 cases
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c)
*  And this morning there are growing concerns about a purge within the FBI. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=0.0s)]
*  Bureau employees have been instructed to complete a questionnaire by today about their involvement [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=4.16s)]
*  in any criminal cases related to the January 6th Capitol attack. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=9.06s)]
*  It's just the latest sign that the Trump administration plans to deliver on its promise to make dramatic [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=13.6s)]
*  changes within the FBI. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=18.12s)]
*  On Friday, at least eight senior FBI executives were told by the Trump administration to resign [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=20.16s)]
*  or they would be fired. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  NBC News has learned the FBI's acting director was also told to turn over the names of every [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=26.96s)]
*  FBI employee involved in investigating the January 6th rioters. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=31.36s)]
*  But he pushed back, promising agents he would follow the law and existing FBI policies. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=35.88s)]
*  The pushback was apparently so much that people wondered if he might be fired himself for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=40.92s)]
*  it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=45.32s)]
*  Joining us now, retired CIA officer Mark Polymeropoulos, he's an NBC News security and intelligence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=46.32s)]
*  analyst. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=51.16s)]
*  Mark, just first, your reaction to this, and I know that you and I were talking about this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=52.16s)]
*  before we came on the air. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=55.8s)]
*  You think that ultimately all of this leads to just Americans being less safe. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=57.18s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=60.48s)]
*  And so, you know, these FBI agents, and it's not just the C-suite, it's not just the senior [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=61.48s)]
*  executive, this is hundreds, if not potentially thousands of agents who worked on the January [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=65.36s)]
*  6th cases, potentially could be walked out the door as early as this week. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  And so what does that mean? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=74.12s)]
*  It means they're taken off of squads who actually are doing things such as counterterrorism, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=75.12s)]
*  counterintelligence, bank robbery, you know, drug interdiction. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=79.0s)]
*  And so literally we are eviscerating law enforcement, and I don't see any outrage here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=82.36s)]
*  These are men and women who, you know, pledge an oath to the Constitution, who are doing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=88.08s)]
*  their jobs, and now are going to be taken off the streets. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=91.32s)]
*  And again, I think Americans are going to be less safe. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=94.12s)]
*  And where's the outrage? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=96.12s)]
*  It's not like these are people who are saying, I specifically want to work on January 6th [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=97.96s)]
*  related cases, maybe in some instances. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=102.24s)]
*  But you don't typically get to just pick your assignment. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=104.24s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=106.68s)]
*  So an FBI special agent is assigned by their supervisor to, you know, conduct an investigation, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=107.68s)]
*  to perhaps, you know, work on a prosecution, especially on January 6 cases like the Proud [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=112.08s)]
*  Boys. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=117.08s)]
*  These are individuals who assaulted police officers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=118.08s)]
*  So they did their job, they did it legally, and now they're going to have not only potentially [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=119.48s)]
*  a black mark in their career, but they might get fired. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=123.14s)]
*  And remember, these are individuals who have mortgages, who are going to lose their health [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=125.4s)]
*  care. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=128.84s)]
*  And so potentially hundreds, if not thousands of FBI special agents out of work. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=129.84s)]
*  Again, this is not something that's good for the American people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=133.56s)]
*  And we reference this in our introduction. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=135.84s)]
*  to yet another head at around three o'clock today, because that's when the questionnaire [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=138.76s)]
*  is due from agents to talk about the nature of the work that they did in relation to the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  January 6th investigations. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  The union is saying basically answer that questionnaire with a non-answer, saying, I [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=150.64s)]
*  haven't had time to review this with my attorney or go through what might be asked of me in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=155.6s)]
*  this questionnaire. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=159.92s)]
*  But where does that ultimately lead us here? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=160.92s)]
*  So that's a great question, Ali, because, you know, ultimately there should be some [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  kind of due process if someone is going to get disciplined. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=166.52s)]
*  Of course, there's no discipline here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=169.08s)]
*  But ultimately, we'll see if they pass over these lists of every FBI special agent or [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=171.44s)]
*  analyst. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=175.88s)]
*  Let me say there's other support personnel as well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=176.88s)]
*  And then what does the administration do with them? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=178.52s)]
*  It's pretty clear that this is an effort to purge the civil service of dedicated professionals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  But there's going to, you know, this is going to come to a head. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=187.36s)]
*  There certainly is going to be legal challenges. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=189.0s)]
*  There's prominent national security attorneys working on this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=190.72s)]
*  But that doesn't help if you're walked out as an FBI agent. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  If you walked out the door on Tuesday or Wednesday and you have a mortgage to pay, if you have [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=196.2s)]
*  child care costs and you need health insurance, really dangerous for the American people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=200.4s)]
*  I have two questions that I hope we can dispense with quickly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=204.68s)]
*  The first is, what does it tell you that there is less outrage than you think that there [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  would be here? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=212.4s)]
*  Democrats have been vocal about the fact that they are concerned. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=213.2s)]
*  There have been some Republicans, but the chorus is small. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=215.84s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=219.48s)]
*  So, you know, so much for the party that backs the blue, the Republican Party and in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=220.72s)]
*  private, all of my Republican friends think this is absolutely ludicrous, but they're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=224.56s)]
*  scared in private, in private. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=228.16s)]
*  And so, you know, ordinarily you would see, you know, particularly GOP senators saying, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=230.08s)]
*  well, hold on a second. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=234.32s)]
*  You know, the FBI needs reform. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=235.16s)]
*  Everybody can agree on that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=236.68s)]
*  But a whole scale purge of federal law enforcement certainly is not good for the American [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=238.08s)]
*  people. But you don't hear that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's just because the sense of palpable fear that they have of the Trump [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=243.32s)]
*  administration, of Elon Musk, of getting primaried of their political futures. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=247.08s)]
*  But they know it's wrong. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=251.56s)]
*  I'm absolutely confident of it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  So that's the landscape from a government view. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=253.96s)]
*  What does this also do to the pipeline of people getting into law enforcement if you're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=256.2s)]
*  trying to take out huge swaths of people that are already there and serving? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=260.48s)]
*  Right, Ali. And so there's another piece of this, too, is that what the federal government [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  has been asked to do. And this is, you know, I hear from a lot of former colleagues in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  the CIA and the FBI and the State Department is that they've been asked to provide the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=270.32s)]
*  names of officials who are in their probationary periods. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=274.08s)]
*  That's with service four years and less. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=277.24s)]
*  And that's because they have less rights. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=279.56s)]
*  And so, again, these government entities are sending in lists. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=281.12s)]
*  And what does that mean? Is that a possible reduction in force? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  That's Generation Z. That's the next generation of national security professionals who [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=286.88s)]
*  might be removed from service. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=290.64s)]
*  How does that make Americans more safe? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=292.2s)]
*  Yeah, you do need people to continue doing these jobs. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=294.28s)]
*  But of course, the goal of this administration is to lessen the workforce. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  They've got to do it somehow. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=300.52s)]
*  Mark Polymeropoulos, thank you so much. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1kgLPbz17c&t=302.0s)]
