# 'Demand better rhetoric': Congresswoman calls for clarity in campus protests
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY)
*  President Biden condemned a rise in anti-Semitism during a speech he delivered yesterday at a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=0.0s)]
*  Holocaust remembrance ceremony. The president drew a parallel between the Holocaust and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=5.12s)]
*  the October 7th attacks by Hamas, which he said were driven by an ancient desire [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=10.16s)]
*  to wipe out the Jewish people. The president also addressed the protests across college campuses [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  over the war in Gaza. In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=22.0s)]
*  to debate and disagree, to protest peacefully and make our voices heard. I understand that's America, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=32.0s)]
*  but there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for anti-Semitism or hate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=42.0s)]
*  speech or threats of violence of any kind, whether against Jews or anyone else. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=48.16s)]
*  Violence attacks, destroying property, is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=54.72s)]
*  And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. We uphold the rule of law, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  and no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=68.4s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman Becca Ballant of Vermont. Congresswoman, so good to see you this morning. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=73.36s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. I was in the room yesterday for that speech, a beautiful space at the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=82.96s)]
*  There were some Holocaust survivors there. It was a very emotional ceremony held every year, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  and in this time the president also delivered these forceful remarks about anti-Semitism. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=92.16s)]
*  What is your reaction to what he said? Do you think he went far enough? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=96.32s)]
*  I'm so glad that we're talking about this this morning. My grandfather was killed in the Holocaust, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  and whenever Holocaust Remembrance Day rolls around, I always have an opportunity to reflect on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  how anti-Semitism has impacted my family. And so I think an important thing that came out of that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=111.91999999999999s)]
*  speech was an acknowledgement of two truths. One, anti-Semitism is real. It is being used by people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  in power to sow division and fear, as it has been throughout history. And there's also a place in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=127.44s)]
*  this country for our First Amendment rights to be used in protest of a government. And it is [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=135.2s)]
*  frustrating for me that you have voices on college campuses right now who are legitimately criticizing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=143.6s)]
*  Netanyahu, legitimately criticizing the war in Gaza, and side by side there are people at those [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=151.28s)]
*  same protests who are saying things that are anti-Semitic. And so we all have to be better [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=157.68s)]
*  about demanding that the rhetoric that is employed does not veer into anti-Semitic tropes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  It's obviously so important to strike that balance. What more can college administrators do? What more [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  can the president and the federal government do? Well, I'm very excited and encouraged by a bill, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=176.8s)]
*  a bipartisan bicameral bill that has been put forward by Jackie Rosen and Senator Langford, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=181.68s)]
*  as well as Manning, Representative Manning and Chris Smith on the House side. What we need is an [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  actual plan. We don't need more resolutions that are not actually achieving the goals of reducing [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  the anti-Semitism in this country. Because what we know is anti-Semitism is manufactured by people [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=201.6s)]
*  in power to sow division and fear. And although anyone can employ it, it most serves those folks [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=207.68s)]
*  who want to use division and fear to keep their power. And so what's exciting about the Rosen, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=214.72s)]
*  Langford and Manning and Chris Smith bill is that it's actually looking to establish an office [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=220.48s)]
*  finally at the national level that is going to put things in place to reduce anti-Semitism [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=227.04s)]
*  on college campuses and not just a feel-good resolution that people can get behind that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=234.16s)]
*  doesn't actually achieve anything. So this speech, of course, was given at a time, a precarious moment [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  in the war in Gaza. Ceasefire for hostage talks ongoing, no deal, no deal yet. And also the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  administration has now decided to limit some of the weapons that will go to Israel, not send some [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=251.76s)]
*  of the bigger bombs out of fear it would go to Ra'afah and take a toll on the civilian population [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=255.84s)]
*  there. What is your reaction to that decision by this White House? I think it's reflecting what [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=260.64s)]
*  most Americans are actually feeling right now. In my conversations with constituents, what they say [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=265.76s)]
*  to me is I support a safe, secure Israel and I also need to see a course correction in this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=271.68s)]
*  horrific offensive in Gaza. And I think one of the critical points of contention is this [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  invasion of Ra'afah that Netanyahu has been threatening for many, many weeks now. And it is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  so crucial that we continue to be a voice that is pushing back against this administration in Israel [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  that has been using excessive force within Gaza. And I don't absolutely, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=302.88s)]
*  I don't think ultimately it's achieving the aims that Israelis want and that we want, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  which is a safe, secure Israel and also a path to a two-state solution. That's what most Americans [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=316.4s)]
*  want. And do you think as a final question that Prime Minister Netanyahu should be the one to be [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=322.32s)]
*  leading Israel at this moment and in that future? I have been very outspoken that I don't think [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=327.68s)]
*  that he is the right leader for Israel. I think we have seen more and more protests, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=332.8s)]
*  people taking to the streets saying, many voices saying he should have resigned when it first [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=336.96s)]
*  happened. It was a colossal failure of intelligence. I'm referring to October 7th, that horrible, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  horrible attack. And so it is not ensuring the safety and security of Israelis to continue [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=349.04s)]
*  to incite this continued violence in Gaza. Democratic Congresswoman Becca Ballant of Vermont, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=357.68s)]
*  thank you for that this morning. We really appreciate it. We'll talk to you again soon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=364.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWfDzTl8IY&t=368.64s)]
