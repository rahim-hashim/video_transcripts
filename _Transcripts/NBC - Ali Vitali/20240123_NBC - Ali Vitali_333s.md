# Ron DeSantis' biggest 2024 miscalculation
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc)
*  The political class wants to say that this race is over. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=0.0s)]
*  And I know the political class is saying everybody needs to get behind Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=4.64s)]
*  This is not a coronation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=8.92s)]
*  You had 56,000 people out of 3 million in Iowa vote for Donald Trump. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=10.88s)]
*  Less than one and a half percent of that state. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  We haven't even started with this election yet. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=20.54s)]
*  We don't do coronations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=23.44s)]
*  A democracy is about giving people options. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=24.8s)]
*  Nikki Haley speaking on Fox News yesterday weighing in on the state of the GOP race ahead [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=28.88s)]
*  of today's primary in New Hampshire. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=34.2s)]
*  Joining us now, founder of the conservative website, the Bullwark, Charlie Sykes. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Charlie, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=41.32s)]
*  So despite Ambassador Haley's comments there, there is sort of a sense that today is maybe [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=42.72s)]
*  her last best chance to really turn this into a race with Donald Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=49.36s)]
*  What do you see here? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  What does she need to do? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  Obviously, if she can pull an upset, then it's on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=57.24s)]
*  If she gets blown out, there's going to be an extraordinary amount of pressure for her [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=60.28s)]
*  to drop out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  And then if she comes up just short, it's close. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=64.88s)]
*  It's hard to say what happens. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=67.68s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=68.84s)]
*  Well, no, it's not a coronation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=69.84s)]
*  But what you are seeing is a stampede. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=73.36s)]
*  You can see the Republicans have already decided that they are moving on to the general election, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=75.44s)]
*  whatever happens in New Hampshire. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=79.64s)]
*  Look, New Hampshire has a long history of being able to surprise us. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=80.88s)]
*  But I think we're going to find out something later today that we already knew, Jonathan, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  which is this is Donald Trump's party, that he controls it, that everybody else is going [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=89.52s)]
*  to fall in the line. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=94.28s)]
*  Nikki Haley, interestingly enough, saved her best shots for the final days of the campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=96.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think it's just a little bit too late. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=101.76s)]
*  Enough to antagonize the MAGA base, but not enough to generate the enthusiasm of the people [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=104.88s)]
*  that she needs really to turn out. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=109.8s)]
*  Again, not writing off New Hampshire, but whatever happens today, she faces just the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=111.72s)]
*  harsh reality that going forward, there's no clear path, there's no indication that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=117.52s)]
*  the Republican Party is about to make a pivot away from Donald Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=121.92s)]
*  In fact, every few minutes, I open up my phone and see another Republican talking themselves [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=125.48s)]
*  into supporting Donald Trump, overlooking the latest gaffe, the latest incident of birtherism, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=133.28s)]
*  the latest outburst. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=139.8s)]
*  This is a party that is once again going to swallow Donald Trump in full and in whole. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=141.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're certainly right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=146.8s)]
*  If there's ever a state that could deliver a surprise, it would be New Hampshire. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=148.8s)]
*  So let's certainly, we want to keep an open mind as to what happens today. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=152.68s)]
*  And we are in this two-person race, which is what Nikki Haley has wanted for some time, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=157.12s)]
*  because Governor DeSantis dropped out. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=161.72s)]
*  You wrote in recent days for MSNBC about his biggest 2024 miscalculation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=170.36s)]
*  Well, he made several miscalculations. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=171.36s)]
*  I mean, number one, he actually thought that if he moved to Donald Trump's right, that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  he could lock down the MAGA base by passing all kinds of legislation, punching liberals [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=178.44000000000003s)]
*  in the face, picking wars with the people that the MAGA hates. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=183.56s)]
*  But the reality is that the Republican Party was not going to move on from Donald Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=188.68s)]
*  They had the real thing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=193.24s)]
*  They didn't want the mini-me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=194.24s)]
*  They didn't want the knockoff. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=195.84s)]
*  The other miscalculation he made was that I think that he honestly believed he didn't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=197.68s)]
*  need to run against Donald Trump, because, you know, surely after all of the criminal [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=201.6s)]
*  indictments, Republicans would take the exit ramp. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that Ron DeSantis was as surprised as anyone to watch as Republicans actually [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  bonded even more closely with Donald Trump after all the criminal charges, after the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  finding that he raped a woman. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=223.28s)]
*  Nothing made any difference whatsoever. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=225.24s)]
*  And so, you know, Ron DeSantis's entire campaign was predicated on the belief that, you know, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=227.52s)]
*  I'm the next man standing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  The Republicans wanted Trumpism without Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  Turns out, Republicans, they just want Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=236.28s)]
*  They want more Trump. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=239.0s)]
*  And they're going to get it, good and hard. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=240.12s)]
*  Sure seems that way, Charlie. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=242.56s)]
*  So let's talk about Trump in our final moment here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=244.06s)]
*  We played a video a short time ago, incredible number of gaffs recently, real mixed up. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=246.88s)]
*  Suddenly his mental acuity really becoming a significant campaign issue now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  Haley doing her part to make it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=256.4s)]
*  So what's your read? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=257.88s)]
*  Is that something that could hurt him come general election, even if not now? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=259.12s)]
*  Well, certainly. I mean, he's not going to get any better between now and November. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=264.28s)]
*  This is what's going to make 2024 such a depressing long slog is this debate like, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=268.35999999999996s)]
*  which which elderly man is more is more impaired. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=274.12s)]
*  But it is important to point out, yes, Joe Biden is old, but so is Donald Trump. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=278.96s)]
*  And Donald Trump is not merely old, but he is also dangerous. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=284.68s)]
*  And I think that that's going to be obviously something that voters are going to have to deal with. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=289.32s)]
*  Republicans have done a very effective job in pointing out every single Biden gaff and raising questions about his age and his fitness. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=293.8s)]
*  And now it's going to be Donald Trump's turn. And it's not going to be pretty. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=300.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're certainly right. Old and dangerous. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=304.8s)]
*  Founder of the conservative website, the Bulwark, Charlie Sykes, thank you for helping us out today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfe-zEqxmc&t=307.47999999999996s)]
