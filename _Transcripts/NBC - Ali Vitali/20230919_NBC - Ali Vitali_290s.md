# Rudy Giuliani sued by his former lawyers for $1.4M in unpaid legal fees
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4)
*  Elsewhere in Trump legal news, Rudy Giuliani is drowning in debt and now his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=0.0s)]
*  own lawyer is suing him for unpaid legal fees. That's according to a lawsuit from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=5.36s)]
*  Robert Costello who alleges that Giuliani failed to pay him and his law [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=10.8s)]
*  firm for legal services related to election interference cases in Georgia [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=15.48s)]
*  and Washington DC and a variety of other legal matters. They claim Giuliani is on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=19.84s)]
*  the hook for nearly 1.4 million dollars in outstanding fees and that he only [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  paid a fraction of the tab, just 214,000 dollars since November 2019 which is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=29.92s)]
*  when he first retained Costello. However the complaint does say that Giuliani [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=35.92s)]
*  made a partial payment of ten thousand dollars last week. In response Giuliani [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=41.28s)]
*  criticized both the lawsuit and Costello saying this quote I can't express how [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=46.16s)]
*  personally hurt I am by what Bob Costello has done. It's a real shame when [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=51.82s)]
*  lawmakers, lawyers do things like this and all I will say is that their bill is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=56.64s)]
*  way in excess to anything approaching legitimate fees. Earlier this month [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=61.76s)]
*  Donald Trump, you'll recall, hosted a hundred thousand dollar a plate [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=67.16s)]
*  fundraiser for Giuliani at his Bedminster New Jersey Golf Club to help [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=70.92s)]
*  with the former New York City Mayor's Legal Defense Fund. It's not yet clear [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=75.2s)]
*  how much that event raised for Giuliani personally. Joining us now talk about all [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=79.0s)]
*  this former litigator and MSNBC legal analyst our friend Lisa Rubin. Lisa, great [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=84.32s)]
*  to see you here on set. Jeffrey Clark, let's start there. He's the latest Trump [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  ally to argue that it was the former president who is solely responsible for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=94.55999999999999s)]
*  his actions. Now that's a an argument that has not worked in every other case [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=100.24s)]
*  we've seen before. Do you think it could be successful in this one? I think it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  might be successful but not for the reasons that he used it yesterday. It [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  won't be successful in allowing Jeff Clark to move his case to federal court [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=112.2s)]
*  because the burden is on him to marshal evidence showing that he was not only a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=116.68s)]
*  federal official but he was acting within the scope of his federal duties. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=122.0s)]
*  That is probably not a fight he's going to win but in terms of him saying Trump [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=125.36s)]
*  ratified my conduct this is actually one of the first times that we've seen [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=130.44s)]
*  somebody in one of the cases closest to Trump say no no no it was his fault and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=134.0s)]
*  I think it's a foreshadowing of things to come. You know we have this judgmentful [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  in County dividing the defendants into two buckets. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=142.08s)]
*  Chesbro and Powell are gonna get their trial on October 23rd. All the rest he's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=144.56s)]
*  left for a different date but now you have Trump's then lawyer or Jeff Clark [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=149.08s)]
*  adjusted department official saying he put me up to it and we know from Trump's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  own lawyers that he is likely to say no no no it was the lawyers fault that this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=158.24s)]
*  happened in the first place. When people go like this makes it really impossible [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=161.88000000000002s)]
*  to try them at the same time oftentimes. Yeah so we'll obviously keep an eye on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  that no timeline again when the judge said he would decide. Let's switch to Rudy Giuliani. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=168.52s)]
*  As we just detailed he is being sued by his lawyers there's been media [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=172.52s)]
*  plenty of media reports about Giuliani's current financial struggles. If he's not [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  able to pay the bill Giuliani is of course an attorney it's been a long time [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=181.8s)]
*  since he was a US attorney and deemed a successful one here in New York. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  May we end up in a scenario where he's gonna be representing himself? I don't know [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  that that will be the case because it's very difficult sometimes to withdraw [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=194.94s)]
*  from a criminal case when you're a lawyer representing somebody who is a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=198.64s)]
*  criminal defendant. Bob Costello doesn't represent Rudy Giuliani in the Fulton [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  County case I should note perhaps because of that reason because he knows [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=205.64s)]
*  it's hard to withdraw. What I think is increasingly likely is that Giuliani's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=208.84s)]
*  legal problems and his mounting financial difficulty are driving him [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=213.04s)]
*  toward bankruptcy where a bunch of people are going to get in line and say [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=216.84s)]
*  this guy owes me money. Those people would include Bob Costello's law firm [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=219.84s)]
*  David off Citron and Bob Costello himself but also folks like Ruby Freeman [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=224.2s)]
*  and Shea Moss who now have a default judgment against Giuliani with respect [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=228.08s)]
*  to their defamation case against him. And lastly and just briefly what is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=232.28s)]
*  there so many of these legal cases twirling right now what's the next thing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  we should be looking out for in any matter involving the former president? I [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  think we should be looking for what Judge Chuckin is going to do on the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=242.44s)]
*  recusal motion that Trump has made and then after that the next thing that we [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=245.52s)]
*  should be looking for is tomorrow where three more people are trying to remove [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  their case to federal court this time it's the three fake electors in Georgia. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  And Trump will also present his argument against the gag order that comes later [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=256.76000000000005s)]
*  this week. Later this month. It is so much going on every day we're so glad [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=260.8s)]
*  you're here to help explain that. Former litigator and MSNBC Lee Lannis, Lisa Rubin, thank you as always. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZHmw9jb2w4&t=264.6s)]
