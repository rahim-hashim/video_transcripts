# Federal judge expected to rule in case to limit Musk's DOGE
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0)
*  The top official at the Social Security Administration has stepped down after she refused a request [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=0.0s)]
*  from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to access sensitive government [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=5.36s)]
*  records at the agency. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=9.96s)]
*  That's according to two sources familiar with the situation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=11.88s)]
*  A White House spokesperson, meanwhile, confirmed that Michelle King left her position at the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=14.4s)]
*  administration over the weekend. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=18.84s)]
*  One of the sources said the dispute leading to King's departure involved Americans' [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=21.22s)]
*  bank information, Social Security numbers, earnings records, marital statuses, dates [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=25.24s)]
*  of birth, and in some cases medical records of a person had already applied for disability [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=29.72s)]
*  benefits. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=34.76s)]
*  So the most sensitive of data. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  As a result, President Trump has appointed Leland Dudek, a manager in charge of the Social [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=38.12s)]
*  Security's anti-fraud office, as acting commissioner of the SSA now that King is out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  And we could get a decision sometime today from a federal judge in Washington, D.C., [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  that could potentially limit Elon Musk and his Doge team from doing things like that, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=52.2s)]
*  accessing government systems and firing federal employees. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=56.6s)]
*  The lawsuit was filed by more than a dozen state attorneys general, but Judge Tanya Chutkin [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=60.52s)]
*  hinted at a hearing yesterday that she might not impose immediate roadblocks to Musk's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=65.44s)]
*  infiltration of the nation's government agencies. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=70.28s)]
*  Judge Chutkin called the Doge's actions, quote, concerning and troubling, but she also said [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=74.0s)]
*  the state's argument was too broad and hypothetical, basically that she needed to see more evidence [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=79.32s)]
*  of imminent harm before she granted a request for a temporary restraining order that would [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=84.27999999999999s)]
*  curtail what Musk and his Doge team are doing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  And then in a surprise filing last night, the Department of Justice stated, Musk is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=92.55999999999999s)]
*  actually not the administrator of Doge, nor is he making personnel decisions at federal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=96.35999999999999s)]
*  agencies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  Might be news to many of us as we've been following this, because Elon is clearly at [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=102.35999999999999s)]
*  the center. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=105.88s)]
*  But in that three page declaration, a White House personnel official revealed that Musk's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  title is senior advisor to the president and that he has no, quote, actual or formal authority [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=110.96s)]
*  to make government decisions himself. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=117.64s)]
*  It's there that we're going to start with former U.S. attorney and MSNBC contributor [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=120.52s)]
*  Barbara McQuade. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to that, Barbara, because it seems important from a legal perspective [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  that these suits are being filed against Musk and Doge, but the White House is saying, no, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=130.76s)]
*  no, he's not technically in charge here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  Is that going to work? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  It's a really interesting revelation, Allie, because I think all of us had assumed that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=139.44s)]
*  Elon Musk was the head of Doge, not just that he worked for Doge. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=145.64s)]
*  In fact, at that Oval Office press conference last week, Donald Trump asked Elon Musk to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  speak about what he was doing at Doge and what he was finding through his work with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=155.56s)]
*  Doge. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=160.56s)]
*  So if he's simply an advisor to President Trump, he doesn't have any authority whatsoever. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=161.72s)]
*  So I do think that this is an important revelation that came in this case. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=166.44s)]
*  Maybe this tips the scale for Judge Chetkin to have a new perspective on what's going [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=171.68s)]
*  on here, or maybe it just opens the door to a different lawsuit to try to clarify what [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=175.76s)]
*  Elon Musk's role is and who is in charge of Doge. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=183.84s)]
*  This does, of course, bring us back to a frequent refrain that we've had on this program, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=187.82s)]
*  on Morning Joe, around the lack of transparency within Doge. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=192.1s)]
*  That's a problem in and of itself. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=195.54s)]
*  But is this just the White House trying to basically get it on a technicality? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=197.72s)]
*  I mean, when we see Musk in action, prominently speaking from the Oval Office about the efforts [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=201.66s)]
*  that Doge is undertaking, can the judge not take that in tandem with the technical piece [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  of this that the White House is saying? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=213.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=216.98s)]
*  I mean, when you file an affidavit in court as this was, you can't make stuff up the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=218.22s)]
*  way you can when you're just shooting the breeze in the Oval Office. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=223.94s)]
*  And so this is an important clarification about what his actual role really is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=227.5s)]
*  I don't think this is an effort to get away with it on a technicality. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  The judge specifically asked for this. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=237.82s)]
*  Like, what is his role anyway? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=239.5s)]
*  And so they were forced to answer that question very specifically. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=241.56s)]
*  But I think what it does highlight is the limits of his authority. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  Certainly, the government and the executive branch is permitted to root out waste, fraud [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=249.06s)]
*  and abuse. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=253.62s)]
*  In fact, that's what inspectors general are there for. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=254.62s)]
*  But of course, many of them have now been fired. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  But only Congress can decide whether to eliminate entire agencies and whether to decline to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=259.9s)]
*  spend funds that have already been appropriated. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=267.62s)]
*  So this is a good clarifying moment. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=270.3s)]
*  I do think it begs the question, if not, Elon Musk, then who is running DOGE? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=272.34s)]
*  And DOGE is, by most accounts, just a renaming of the U.S. Digital Services, which is an [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=277.02s)]
*  agency set up by the executive branch to try to improve our computer systems in the federal [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=283.34s)]
*  government. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=288.9s)]
*  But clarification of that would be useful. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=289.9s)]
*  Yeah, definitely clarification needed, because I had the same question that you did. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=292.17999999999995s)]
*  OK, if Musk is not actually in charge here, who is? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=295.62s)]
*  I think many people would like to know that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=298.29999999999995s)]
*  And I also want to talk to you about something overnight. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=300.78000000000003s)]
*  You were one signatory on an open letter to current federal prosecutors from former U.S. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=302.98s)]
*  attorneys and other prosecutors basically saying and supporting them in the way that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=308.82s)]
*  they've stood up to some actions from this Department of Justice, specifically when it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=313.54s)]
*  came to forcing folks to dismiss the charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  Talk a little bit about that letter. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=324.36s)]
*  How unusual is it for former prosecutors to put their names on something like this? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=325.62s)]
*  Yeah, you know, former prosecutors like current prosecutors are apolitical in their work toward [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  the Department of Justice. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=337.18s)]
*  This is a group of former Justice Department lawyers who are appalled by what we have seen [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=338.68s)]
*  in the Eric Adams case. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=342.58s)]
*  And we wanted to show our support for the prosecutors who remain across our country, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=344.18s)]
*  who are being asked to do the right thing, but might find themselves under similar pressure [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=349.46s)]
*  that Danielle Sassoon found herself under and the other six prosecutors who chose to resign. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=354.7s)]
*  We support that decision, but we also want to say you need to stay in there and stand up [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=361.29999999999995s)]
*  for the rule of law. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  We're counting on you to get that job done. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  And so it is completely appalling to see Emil Bove and others suggest that a criminal case [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=369.74s)]
*  can be dismissed simply to gain political advantage in a case. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=377.9s)]
*  That is not how the work is done. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=382.14s)]
*  And we wanted to make that clear to the American people who might not understand the non-transactional [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=384.02s)]
*  nature of criminal prosecution. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=388.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, people are definitely getting a crash course in how things typically and now atypically [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=390.38s)]
*  work from a Department of Justice and law enforcement perspective. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=395.5s)]
*  Barbara Quaid, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=398.94s)]
*  Thanks, Ali. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxvN7YLc1S0&t=401.18s)]
