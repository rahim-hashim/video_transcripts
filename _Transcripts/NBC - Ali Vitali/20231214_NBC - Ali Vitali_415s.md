# 49 percent disapprove of Biden impeachment inquiry
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI)
*  Welcome back to way too early. The latest polling from NPR, PBS and Marist College shows [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=0.0s)]
*  that Americans are divided on the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. In this [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=7.42s)]
*  new survey, 48% of registered voters say they approve of the inquiry by House Republicans, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=12.16s)]
*  while 49% say they disapprove. In a separate question, 42% expressed a favorable opinion [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=18.12s)]
*  of Biden compared to 52% who view him unfavorably. While those numbers are underwater and down [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=24.92s)]
*  for the president from previous Marist polls, we should note his favorability is still higher [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=32.0s)]
*  than Donald Trump's, whose sits at just 38%. And in a hypothetical 2024 general election [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  matchup, the poll shows Biden leading Trump by a single point, 49 to 48. That's of course [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=43.56s)]
*  within the margin of error and doesn't account for the occlusion of any possible third party [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=50.0s)]
*  candidates. Once again, folks, the only thing we know about this race is it's going to be really [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=54.68s)]
*  close. Joining us now, NBC News, senior national politics reporter, Jonathan Allen. Good to see [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=58.84s)]
*  you, my friend. So let's start with some of these poll numbers and the impeachment inquiry [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=65.32s)]
*  into President Biden, the Americans divided here. You know, there is been a sense among some [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=71.36s)]
*  Democrats that this is a huge overreach by Republicans and it's blatantly partisan. And [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=77.76s)]
*  then while no president wants to deal with an impeachment inquiry or if they go down the road [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  to actual impeachment itself, they think this could be a political gift that voters will have [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=87.84s)]
*  a backlash against this. But these poll numbers suggest maybe not. Not only do the poll numbers [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  suggest that, but we've seen this movie before. Back before the 2016 election, the House Republicans [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=97.12s)]
*  opened up a Benghazi investigation into, you know, effectively into Hillary Clinton, which then [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=102.84s)]
*  yielded all the questions about Hillary Clinton's emails, which hung over her campaign for basically [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=108.68s)]
*  the entirety of the campaign. You know, at the very end, you had Jim Comey coming out just a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=114.92s)]
*  couple of days before the election to say there was nothing new on Anthony Weiner's laptop, that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  they'd already seen those emails when he had first exonerated or at least said they weren't going to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=123.88s)]
*  the prosecutor in the summer. So Republicans have reason to believe that they can have a damaging effect on a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=129.8s)]
*  president or a presidential candidate with an investigation, even if it goes absolutely nowhere. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=134.08s)]
*  Obviously, everyone knew who was responsible for the deaths of Benghazi. It was the people who attacked [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  the compound, not Hillary Clinton. So they've seen this before and they've done it before. And, you know, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=145.08s)]
*  maybe this will be a different outcome, but it's not new. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  And the Republicans, as we noted earlier, are saying the quiet part out loud, saying, yes, we hope this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=155.6s)]
*  damages President Biden politically. Let's talk about the president's son, Hunter Biden. And we should be [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=159.84s)]
*  clear, of course, Hunter Biden is not a candidate for office. He has never worked in the White House. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=165.36s)]
*  And again, many Democrats feel that is also trumped up charges. What's your analysis, though, as you [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=170.72s)]
*  talk to those in and out of the race in either party? Do they think that the Hunter Biden matter is going [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=177.12s)]
*  to impact voters next year? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  I think they're worried that it may. And it certainly is something that is a distraction to the White House. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there's an entire effectively an entire White House unit devoted to dealing with [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=189.27999999999997s)]
*  investigations. So that includes the impeachment inquiry. Obviously, it includes Hunter Biden. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=193.92s)]
*  I think that's why you're seeing Hunter Biden, at least part of the reason you're seeing Hunter Biden fight [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=198.72s)]
*  back. He's tired of being the prey. He's going to act a little more like the name Hunter goes out there [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=202.44s)]
*  yesterday and slams the House Republicans because the president himself can't do that as much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  It makes him look partisan. And the Republicans understand this. If you are if you are forcing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  Biden to attack people who aren't on the ballot at the presidential level, meaning the House [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=220.08s)]
*  Republicans over something that sounds bad for Biden, that's not helpful to him. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=224.24s)]
*  Yeah. And the White House has been clear that Biden won't address DOJ matters or matters with [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=228.88s)]
*  Congress like this. But as I reported this morning, there's I mean, not only is President Biden really [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  worried about his son, but a lot of people close to the president are worried about the toll this [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=237.44s)]
*  whole thing will take on him, particularly as he ramps up for a reelection campaign. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=241.52s)]
*  So let's shift to the Republicans now. Iowa caucuses month away, if you can believe it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=246.4s)]
*  The polls are what the polls are. Donald Trump is way ahead. But we're seeing a lot of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=251.44s)]
*  members of that field really descend on the Hawkeye state. What are some things you're going to look [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  for here in these next few days for the holidays? Yeah, I think the big thing is who's dumping a ton [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=258.88s)]
*  of money in there. You know, when you dump money, that tells where your priorities are. And if you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=264.16s)]
*  see Nikki Haley suddenly dumping a ton of money in there, you know, maybe she thinks she's going [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=268.56s)]
*  to be able to beat Ron DeSantis out for second. I don't think there's any illusion on the part of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=272.64s)]
*  any of these candidates that they're going to beat Trump. I mean, DeSantis has been for a long time [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=278.16s)]
*  playing down the importance of Iowa, even as he's essentially lived in the state. So I'll look for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  that. And then, of course, you know, you always look for the first sort of the momentum on the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  ground when you go talk to voters at events, when you go talk to county party chairs, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=291.28s)]
*  are they sensing any sort of difference in the report that they get back from voters? So there [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=295.92s)]
*  had been some sense some months ago, there is a reporting here in other places that there was a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  little bit of worry among Trump team about their effort in Iowa that that state that he didn't do [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=305.76s)]
*  all that well in 2016. Has that now gone away? How confident are they? I think they're extraordinarily [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  confident. You know, I think there's a fine line between worry and just doing your due diligence, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=315.6s)]
*  and they got caught somewhere in between that, you know, so they were doing enough to make it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=322.24s)]
*  look like they were worried, but they would characterize it as due diligence. And again, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=325.36s)]
*  the polls really haven't changed in terms of, you know, he's standing in the state, which is basically, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=329.68s)]
*  you know, nearly half the Iowa voters prefer him. And then briefly on that race for second, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=335.36s)]
*  you know, Haley versus DeSantis, give us a snapshot as to where polls stand. And what does DeSantis [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=340.16s)]
*  need to do there in Iowa to even frankly make it to New Hampshire? Well, we know Haley is going to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  be stronger. It's a big question, right? You know, he's been keeping the donors going for quite a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  while here on this idea that he can get to a one on one with Donald Trump. But I think Iowa is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=354.16s)]
*  affected at some level by New Hampshire, not every voter. But I mean, this sort of discussion [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  around it certainly is. And Haley is so far ahead of him in New Hampshire that it's something he's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=363.6s)]
*  got to sort of make Iowans not pay attention to and say, hey, I'm your guy. I'm your Trump alternative. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=369.36s)]
*  Stick with me. And so far, it seems to be working. You know, we saw Haley peak at basically a tie [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  with DeSantis, and then she's receded a few points. So we'll have to see. I mean, they are [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=379.04s)]
*  close enough that it is likely that it will come out of there as a split decision as to the Trump [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=383.68s)]
*  alternative, which of course benefits only Donald Trump. Only Donald J. Trump. Busy month ahead. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K71P9wpPczI&t=388.64s)]
