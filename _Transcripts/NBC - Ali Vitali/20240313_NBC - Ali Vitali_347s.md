# Trump's inflammatory rhetoric escalates
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU)
*  Our country's in serious trouble. We have millions and millions of people flowing in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=0.0s)]
*  We have no respect on the world stage. What we say doesn't mean a thing anymore. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=5.84s)]
*  Our nation is failing. We're a nation that is in serious decline. We've never had a situation [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=10.32s)]
*  like this, where we're not respected, we're left at, we're considered almost a joke. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=18.0s)]
*  We're going to close our borders. We're going to do things like nobody's ever seen before. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=24.72s)]
*  That's another dark and dystopian message from Donald Trump last night, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=31.68s)]
*  ending with the vague warning, we're going to do things that nobody's ever seen before. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  The presumptive Republican nominee fueling his campaign for president with an anti-migrant [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=40.8s)]
*  message that's raising deep concerns about an underlying ideology that threatens American [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=45.28s)]
*  democracy. Joining us now for this important conversation, my dear friend, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=51.84s)]
*  professor at Princeton University, Eddie Glaude Jr. Eddie, thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  So as we just played there, after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, he put up [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=60.24s)]
*  more inflammatory rhetoric. It's continuing to escalate and his base continues to embrace it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=65.12s)]
*  Why do you think that is? Talk to us, if you will, about what's motivating Trump's base right now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=71.2s)]
*  EDDIE GALDEAUX, President, Princeton University I think this is a really important question, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=76.72s)]
*  Jonathan, and it's so great to see you this morning, because we tend to focus on Trump's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  autocratic tendencies. We focus on his personality, his quirks, his failings. But I think we need to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  pay more attention to the ideology that he's appealing to, and that is this sense of grievance [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=90.8s)]
*  and hatred, this sense that what we talked about in 2022 as great replacement theory, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=94.88s)]
*  right, that somehow that these people from elsewhere, these dark and brown people, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=100.72s)]
*  are coming to replace white Christians. And Donald Trump is appealing to that underlying sense [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=105.52s)]
*  that their people are losing their nation. And that notion, right, of this kind of immigrant [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=110.88s)]
*  influx, this invasion, has a kind of global kind of currency across the West. And this is central [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=116.88s)]
*  to, say, Orban's popularity. Remember, Jonathan, right after the Buffalo mass shooting, Orban went [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=124.0s)]
*  on television on May 16 of 2022 in Hungary and basically agreed with the ideology in the manifesto [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=130.8s)]
*  of the Buffalo shooter. And so there are these intimate connections here that we have to begin [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=138.72s)]
*  to unpack. And you mentioned Orban, who you've highlighted before. Trump idealizes him, and Orban [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  is a symbol of white Christian nationalism. And I think this is really important. And he talked to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=151.36s)]
*  us, if you will, about the threat that white Christian nationalism poses here in the United [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=155.68s)]
*  States, particularly if Trump were to take office again. Right, I think this is really important. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=160.4s)]
*  Your colleague at Politico, Hadi Prisbella, has reported on this in very, very clear and, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=166.4s)]
*  I think, compelling ways and has become, in some ways, the target, right? She's showing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=172.56s)]
*  the connection between these forces who believe that the U.S. should be a kind of Christian nation, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  that the U.S. should be run by Christian principles as they understand those principles. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  The Center for Renewing America, for example, she connected to this. We see it in the Alabama [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=185.84s)]
*  justice decision with regards to IVF, informed by, in some ways, the kind of Christian nationalism, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=192.48s)]
*  right? We see it in Project 2025, where 100 right-wing organizations signed on to this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=198.24s)]
*  draft, Jonathan, suggesting that the U.S. government should be run by Christian principles. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  And what's interesting is that those Christian principles are overdetermined by the adjective. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=209.92s)]
*  What do I mean? It's not just simply Christianity. It's white Christianity. And that ideology of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=215.44s)]
*  whiteness, right, bound up with this ideology that God sanctions a white nation, right, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=222.16s)]
*  undermines or, let me say, undergirds so much of the ideology that Trump is putting forward here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  And we have to, I think we have to spend some time there as we think about the autocratic [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=234.48s)]
*  tendencies of Donald Trump. And lastly, Eddie, just talk to us about something that we've really [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=238.88s)]
*  tried to hammer home here on Way Too Early in Mourning Joe, which is about the stakes of this [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=243.04s)]
*  coming election, not just the day-to-day horse race campaign news, but the stakes and how [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  the fate of American democracy could hang in the balance. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=253.2s)]
*  You know, Jonathan, that's so true. I was reading Frederick Douglass's July 5, 1852 address [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  the other day. And there's a line in the address. He says, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=265.04s)]
*  there's a horrible monster called coiled in the nation's, coiled tight in the nation's bosom, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  a horrible reptile coiled tight in the nation's bosom. And he was referring to slavery. But in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=277.68s)]
*  fact, what was behind the issue of slavery was this idea of the country. And so here we are in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=284.16s)]
*  this moment where that coiled tight reptile that has threatened democracy, threatened to choke the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=290.08s)]
*  life out of democracy since its beginning, right, has revealed its head, its ugly head again. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=297.52s)]
*  And Douglass in 1852 begged us to tear it away from our hearts. And today in this election, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=304.56s)]
*  we must try to do it again. Can you imagine? So many years later, we must try, we must [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=312.64s)]
*  desperately do it again. Professor at Princeton University, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=318.64s)]
*  Eddie Glaude Jr., an important conversation this morning. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypYEJItBDfU&t=322.8s)]
