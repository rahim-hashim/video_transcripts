# Trump prepares extensive opposition file on 'Ron DeSanctimonious'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4)
*  Welcome back. There's new information this morning surrounding former President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=0.0s)]
*  2024 campaign and the opposition file that his team is preparing for use against Florida [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=5.44s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis. As Politico reports, the preparations indicate an upcoming primary [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=11.36s)]
*  fight that could make the, quote, 2016 primary fireworks look tame in comparison. We're all [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=17.62s)]
*  looking forward to that. Trump's team is planning to attack DeSantis' record as a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=24.6s)]
*  governor, as a congressman, and his record as a prosecutor, specifically that DeSantis was a, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=28.56s)]
*  quote, extremely lenient prosecutor in cases involving, among other things, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=34.72s)]
*  potentially child pornography. So far, the Trump team has conducted focus groups to hone in on the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  messaging, per the reporting. The goal will be to take advantage of the time before DeSantis [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=46.64s)]
*  officially announces a run by launching new lines of attack on the governor while casting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=52.08s)]
*  him as the establishment favorite. Joining us now, the author of that piece, national political [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  correspondent for Politico, our friend Meredith McGraw. Meredith, great to see you. So let's talk [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=62.8s)]
*  about this opposition file. Has the Trump campaign worked up a file like this about anybody else who [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=67.44s)]
*  might jump in the race? And what in particular are they trying to drive home about DeSantis? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=74.0s)]
*  Well, this is what campaigns do, right? They dig into their opposition. And right now, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=78.28s)]
*  Trump's team is looking into Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' time as a member of Congress, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=84.12s)]
*  as a prosecutor, his private life, and his time, of course, as governor of Florida. And they're [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  trying to see exactly the best line of attack for them against the Florida governor before he's even [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=98.44000000000001s)]
*  announced he's getting into the race. Donald Trump has made no secret that he plans to barrel [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  ahead with his broadsides against DeSantis. He has been testing out nicknames in public and with [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=111.4s)]
*  reporters. And he's really gone after DeSantis' record as someone who has sort of backpedaled on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=117.4s)]
*  privatizing Social Security and Medicare, among other things, from his time in Congress. But one [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=126.84s)]
*  of the things that they are looking at, too, is his time as a prosecutor digging into individual [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=135.08s)]
*  cases. This isn't anything new for a campaign to do. This is pretty standard fare. But before [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=141.48s)]
*  DeSantis has even gotten into the race, the Trump campaign has made clear that he's their number one [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=147.72s)]
*  target. Yeah, it does seem like they're doing everything they can to keep DeSantis from jumping [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=152.76s)]
*  in the race. Unlikely, that will be successful. But one area where DeSantis and Trump seem to agree, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=156.44s)]
*  DeSantis made a lot of headlines this week by suggesting that the U.S. does not need [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=163.08s)]
*  necessarily to involve itself in the Ukraine-Russian conflict, deeming it a territorial dispute, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=167.72000000000003s)]
*  when of course this was Russia invading its sovereign neighbor. And there's been some GOP [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=173.56s)]
*  pushback to that. Tell us a little bit, Meredith, about how this issue could shape the Republican [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  primary field, because it does seem like a lot of GOP voters might agree with the two of them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, for a while, there's been some searching into what exactly is the Florida governor's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=189.8s)]
*  position on foreign policy. People have looked back at his time in Congress when he was on the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=197.16000000000003s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee to see exactly where he stands on a lot of positions, and it was kind of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=203.0s)]
*  unclear. So when he came out with this questionnaire on Fox News' Tucker Carlson show, it really did [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=207.96s)]
*  take a lot of people by surprise when he aligned himself with Trump, with Tucker Carlson, too, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=215.72s)]
*  in calling this a territorial dispute. And this really goes against what a lot of people in his [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=222.76s)]
*  own party, party leadership, people like McConnell and even those who have announced they're running [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=228.12s)]
*  for president, like Nikki Haley, are likely to, like former Vice President Mike Pence, who have [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=232.76s)]
*  said that this is about freedom. And we've seen senators on Capitol Hill who have really [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=239.24s)]
*  taken offense to how DeSantis has described the war in Ukraine in this questionnaire and have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=249.16s)]
*  called on him to perhaps reconsider or take into consideration the humanitarian [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  disaster that the war has called as well. But, you know, the DeSantis lining up here with [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=265.96s)]
*  Trump and the Tucker Carlson wing, we've seen some waning support for Ukraine in polling, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=276.44s)]
*  but this really did take some people, especially Republicans on Capitol Hill, by surprise. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=283.88s)]
*  Yeah, there was certainly at least a firestorm criticism, at least from Republicans in the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  Senate, far less though in the House. We'll see how this shapes the race going forward. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=292.68s)]
*  Politico's Meredith McGraw. Thank you, as always, for bringing us this morning. Great reporting today. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcPaDSRiIF4&t=297.24s)]
