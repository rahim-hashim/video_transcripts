# Trump demands Senate majority leader allow recess appointments
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8)
*  Donald Trump is, to the surprise of no one, involving himself in the race for Senate leadership. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, in a Trump's, in a truth social post, Trump demanded that the next majority [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=5.76s)]
*  leader agree to recess appointments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=10.48s)]
*  That would allow the president to appoint people to senior administration positions [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=14.0s)]
*  without the Senate's confirmation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=18.52s)]
*  Trump did not endorse any candidate for that Senate post, but the three lawmakers who are [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=21.88s)]
*  vying for the position all appear to agree with the idea. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=26.92s)]
*  Senator Rick Scott of Florida wrote on X, I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=31.480000000000004s)]
*  through as quickly as possible. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=37.28s)]
*  Senator John Thune of South Dakota responded with, quote, all options are on the table. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=40.0s)]
*  And Senator John Cornyn of Texas noted that the Constitution does allow the president [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=45.2s)]
*  to make recess appointments. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=49.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, several Republicans are now throwing their support behind Senator Scott. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=50.96s)]
*  He secured endorsements from Senators Rand Paul and Tommy Tuberville, as well as Bill [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=55.68s)]
*  Haggerty, who is seen as a top contender for a post in Trump's incoming State Department. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=59.56s)]
*  Elon Musk, who certainly has Trump's ear these days, also announced his support for Scott [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=65.88s)]
*  and called Thune a, quote, top choice for Democrats. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=70.44s)]
*  The upper chamber is scheduled to elect a new leader on Wednesday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=75.12s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst Brendan Buck, who knows a thing or two about congressional [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=78.92s)]
*  leadership. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=84.28s)]
*  And former aid to House speakers Ryan and Boehner. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=85.88s)]
*  Brendan, great to see you as always. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=88.88s)]
*  So let's start with your thoughts on Trump's request. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=91.04s)]
*  He's clearly already starting to govern from social media. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=94.64s)]
*  Talk to us why he would want recess appointments. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=97.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot going on here, whether or not that's even a practical thing to do. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=101.68s)]
*  The House and Senate, or excuse me, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have worked together [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=107.44s)]
*  for many years to block this very thing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=111.28s)]
*  They come in session regularly just so that presidents can't use this recess appointment [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=114.84s)]
*  power. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=118.72s)]
*  And the reason is that it is the Senate's prerogative to vet and confirm nominees. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=119.72s)]
*  That is one of their key constitutional responsibilities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  And what is so interesting here is you have Republicans tripping over themselves to take [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=127.66s)]
*  away their own authority, their own power that obviously speaks to the grip that Donald [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=132.44s)]
*  Trump is going to have over Senate Republicans. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=140.6s)]
*  Now, the House has always been, you know, do whatever Donald Trump says. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  The Senate has been a little more different. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Clearly we're in a new era where they are willing to take extraordinary measures to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=149.64s)]
*  have him advance his agenda. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=155.48s)]
*  Now, I don't think that you're going to need recess appointments for Donald Trump's cabinet [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  selections. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=161.56s)]
*  I think they're going to get confirmed relatively easily and probably relatively quickly, almost [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=162.56s)]
*  no matter who he chooses. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  This is more about there are almost 1,200 positions in the government that require Senate [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=167.96s)]
*  confirmation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  You're talking here about your deputy undersecretaries throughout the government who are doing the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  more operational things. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  These are the people you probably never heard of, but are going to be doing the day-to-day [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=179.88s)]
*  running of Donald Trump's government. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=183.56s)]
*  And Donald Trump would like to get them in place as quickly as possible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  And if he can do a recess appointment, he could do all of these at once and have his [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=188.56s)]
*  calling shots on his behalf in a way that would allow them to get moving much more quickly [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=193.72s)]
*  than you normally would. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=199.52s)]
*  Yeah, and to stock an administration full of loyalists who will simply do his bidding, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=200.52s)]
*  whatever that might be. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=204.48s)]
*  Brendan, give us your quick sense. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=205.48s)]
*  Handicapped the race for us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=207.2s)]
*  Certainly a lot of momentum right now for Senator Scott. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=208.2s)]
*  Yeah, Rick Scott was clearly running as a protest candidate, I would say, before this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=211.2s)]
*  election. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=216.8s)]
*  John Thune and John Cornyn are sort of establishment. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=217.8s)]
*  They've both been in leadership. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=220.12s)]
*  And Rick Scott was running as a protest candidate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=222.44000000000003s)]
*  We want some changes in how the rules are going to go. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=224.0s)]
*  If you want our votes, you're going to have to listen to us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=225.68s)]
*  But after what happened in the election, I think if you're a Senate Republican, the protest [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  candidate looks pretty good. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=233.44s)]
*  Somebody who's against the establishment. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=235.28s)]
*  And so you're going to see some momentum there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=237.36s)]
*  Now, I still don't think that Rick Scott is the favorite. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=238.96s)]
*  I think Rick Scott is going to get a decent showing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=241.8s)]
*  He may end up making his way to the second ballot. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=243.8s)]
*  It's notable that Elon Musk was going after John Thune, who I think people think actually [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=246.68s)]
*  is the real favorite here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=250.32s)]
*  But Rick Scott has positioned himself as somebody who is there to represent the interests of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=253.16s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=257.32s)]
*  But I still think most senators want a leader who is there to represent their particular [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=258.32s)]
*  interests. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=261.72s)]
*  And, Brad, then in our last like 45 seconds, another place where Trump's going to make [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=262.72s)]
*  a huge impact, the courts, potentially even the highest court in the land. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=266.48s)]
*  Give us your sense as to what might be coming. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=270.48s)]
*  Yeah, obviously Mitch McConnell has made that the priority of Senate Republicans, but both [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=272.68s)]
*  parties have recently. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=277.2s)]
*  I mean, it is when there is inaction legislatively, the court or the excuse me, the calendar just [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=278.24s)]
*  gets filled up with these these these court nominations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=284.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to be the same. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  They made enormous impact his first four years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=290.68s)]
*  I think the next four are going to completely reshape the judiciary in a conservative direction. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=293.12s)]
*  And there's very little the Democrats can do about it because the rules have been changed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=298.36s)]
*  They just need a simple majority. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=301.48s)]
*  And for decades, you're going to have a lot of conservative judges on the bench. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=303.4s)]
*  And of course, Trump already had three Supreme Court appointments likely to have more. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=307.16s)]
*  I know there's been some rumors about justice Sotomayor, whether she would step down or [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  not. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  But her team says that's not going to be the case. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  We shall see in the years ahead. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=317.36s)]
*  MSNBC political analyst, Brandon Buck. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=318.68s)]
*  Brandon, thank you as always. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  We'll talk to you again real soon. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqeKovTbZf8&t=321.52000000000004s)]
