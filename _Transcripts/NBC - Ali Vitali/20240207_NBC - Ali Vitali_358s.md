# Biden urges Congress to pass bipartisan border bill
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA)
*  Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=0.0s)]
*  the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA Republican friends. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=5.7s)]
*  It's time for Republicans in the Congress to show a little courage, to show a little [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=11.24s)]
*  spine, to make it clear to the American people and people that you work not for anyone else. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=15.92s)]
*  That was President Joe Biden speaking from the White House yesterday calling on Congress [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=23.36s)]
*  to pass the Senate's bipartisan border bill, which Republicans are now firmly against and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=26.82s)]
*  seems likely to die today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=31.96s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for the Associated Press, Darlene Superville. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=34.66s)]
*  Good to see you, Darlene. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=39.22s)]
*  So let's start with the policy part of this first. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=40.22s)]
*  That if this bill does indeed go down to defeat today, as it seems likely, what would the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  White House's strategy be for a Plan B? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=49.82s)]
*  And is there one in terms of both the border but also getting aid to Ukraine and that country's time of need? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=52.3s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=58.58s)]
*  That's a million dollar question. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  It isn't clear at this point what the Plan B is. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=62.9s)]
*  The White House had been saying up until last week that what they wanted was the bigger [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  comprehensive bill the president sent up to Congress some weeks ago, the money for Ukraine, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  the border and some allies in Asia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=78.9s)]
*  The president doesn't seem, at least at this point, interested in a standalone funding [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=83.3s)]
*  bill for Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=88.8s)]
*  He would want that money coupled with funding for Ukraine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=91.18s)]
*  There is deep and growing opposition in Congress, particularly among Republicans, to continuing [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  to send more money to Ukraine. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=102.12s)]
*  And so that's the holdup. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=103.94s)]
*  That's part of the reason the president coupled all these measures together in the first place, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=105.7s)]
*  because he and the White House saw the rising opposition in Congress to giving more money [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=109.7s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=116.18s)]
*  So it's unclear at this point what the next steps are going to be. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=117.18s)]
*  And of course, as he kept saying, they gave the Republicans what they wanted on the border [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=119.94s)]
*  and the Republicans pulled the plug. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=122.98s)]
*  So we just played that clip from the president making clear that he's going to use this as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=124.38s)]
*  a campaign issue, that if indeed this bill is defeated, he is going to go around the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=128.66s)]
*  country, he says, and tell voters who want something done at the border, the reason why [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=133.18s)]
*  nothing is happening is because Donald Trump and his followers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=137.18s)]
*  So tell us what that could look like. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=140.82s)]
*  Is there confidence in the Biden world that the president is going to have a strong voice [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=143.5s)]
*  on that issue around the country? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=147.74s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=150.02s)]
*  As you just said, this was a bill that Republicans wanted. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=151.38s)]
*  We heard them talk for months, maybe years, about the border and needing to secure the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=155.94s)]
*  border and money for the border and border security. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=161.56s)]
*  And here you had a group of lawmakers who spent the better part of the last four months [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  negotiating this only to see Republicans then turn around, listen to former President Donald [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=167.96s)]
*  Trump and basically tank the bill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=174.28s)]
*  And in doing so, they've given the president and Democrats an issue to run on in November. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think you'll see the president raise this in his speeches at fundraisers that he's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  giving. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=186.24s)]
*  He's going to New York today, for example, for three fundraisers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=187.28s)]
*  And I would be surprised if he doesn't bring that up today. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=191.52s)]
*  I think you'll also hear him talk about it at other campaign events, get out the vote [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=196.0s)]
*  events that he's been doing, and just make the point, as you heard him say, that every [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=200.08s)]
*  day — he may not do it every day between now and November, but I think we will certainly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=205.28s)]
*  hear the president hammering this point home about what the White House would say is just [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  hypocrisy on the side of Republicans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  And another example, again, that the White House would say of Republicans putting the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=219.12s)]
*  interests of the former president ahead of the interests of the American people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=224.44s)]
*  And we certainly anticipate hearing a lot from President Biden in the coming days. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  As you mentioned, he's got a trio of fundraisers in Manhattan today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=231.44s)]
*  Tomorrow in Virginia, a Democratic lawmakers retreat. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  He also suggested he might be holding some sort of news conference tomorrow. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=236.52s)]
*  So they also can connect this, the border, of course. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=240.22000000000003s)]
*  As you know, Darlene, the Biden team points to polling that suggests when they talk about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=243.6s)]
*  democracy, that resonates with voters. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=247.76s)]
*  And senior aide was telling me yesterday that if indeed these bills go down, the Ukraine [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=250.4s)]
*  piece of it will be important, too, because there is Republican opposition, to be sure. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=254.8s)]
*  But general polling suggests most Americans still want to back Ukraine. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=258.32s)]
*  And they say they're going to be able to paint the Republicans as doing Vladimir Putin's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=262.24s)]
*  bidding. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=266.72s)]
*  Talk to us about how they might do that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=267.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=269.44s)]
*  The president touched on this yesterday in his remarks that every week, every month that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=270.6s)]
*  goes by without additional U.S. assistance to Ukraine just puts Ukraine at a disadvantage [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=275.68s)]
*  against Russia. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=281.84s)]
*  And if Russia were to succeed and barrel through Ukraine, what's to stop Russia from going [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=283.66s)]
*  into other countries? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=289.72s)]
*  For example, Poland, which borders Ukraine, or even Finland. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=290.84s)]
*  And both of those countries are NATO members. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=295.0s)]
*  Under the NATO charter, an attack on one member is an attack on all. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=297.28s)]
*  And a scenario like that would most definitely pull the United States into a direct war with [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  Russia, which is something the president has been trying to avoid these past couple of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=308.11999999999995s)]
*  years in terms of trying to help Ukraine fight off Russia on its own. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  So there's that angle, too. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=318.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, there's such important weighty global consequences, you say. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  And it also just seems like the Republicans have handed President Biden another couple [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=323.68s)]
*  good campaign issues here as things start to heat up for 2024. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=327.56s)]
*  We're always grateful for Darlene Superville, White House reporter for the Associated Press, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=332.16s)]
*  when she can join us. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=335.88s)]
*  Darlene, thank you so much. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OsrT8F7fA&t=336.88s)]
