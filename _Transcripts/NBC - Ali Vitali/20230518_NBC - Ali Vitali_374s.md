# President Biden arrives in Japan
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc)
*  We turn now to the city of Hiroshima, Japan, the site of this year's G7 summit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden arrived there about an hour ago after first landing at a Marine base outside [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  of the city. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=9.56s)]
*  He was greeted by Japanese officials as well as former White House chief of staff and the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=10.56s)]
*  former mayor of Chicago, Ron Emanuel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=15.26s)]
*  Emanuel, of course, now serves as the United States ambassador to Japan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  You're seeing two men there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=21.8s)]
*  Soon after touching down, President Biden went on to meet with some American Marine [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=22.96s)]
*  members, troops who were stationed at the U.S. base. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=28.08s)]
*  Today, that base is home to roughly 15,000 personnel, including employees that are Japanese [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  nationals. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=36.08s)]
*  After meeting with the troops, President Biden flew by helicopter to Hiroshima, where he [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=37.48s)]
*  is currently holding a bilateral meeting with Japan's prime minister, Kishida. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=41.56s)]
*  The G7 summit officially begins tomorrow, the gathering of the nation's wealthiest [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=46.92s)]
*  democracies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=51.4s)]
*  Joining us now from Hiroshima, White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Ken [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=52.72s)]
*  Thomas traveling with the president. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  Ken, great to see you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=58.92s)]
*  Thanks for being with us now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=60.36s)]
*  Let's start with the matters at hand. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=62.44s)]
*  What does the president hope to do and accomplish at this meeting with the Japanese prime minister [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=64.76s)]
*  and the G7 at home? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=70.52s)]
*  Yeah, you just saw the footage of the president speaking with Prime Minister Kishida. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=72.52s)]
*  I think there's an interest here to try to show unity on these big ticket issues like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=78.24s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia and also China. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=84.32s)]
*  But the main thing that's looming over these G7 meetings is the debt ceiling back home. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=87.84s)]
*  You know, John, if you go back, the irony here is that the origins of the G7 started [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=93.28s)]
*  in the 1970s when the U.S. and large industrialized countries tried to provide economic stability [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=100.12s)]
*  and find a way out of recession. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=108.4s)]
*  And now we're at a point where that very stability could be threatened if the U.S. were to default [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=110.92s)]
*  on its debt. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=117.28s)]
*  Yeah, no question there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=118.28s)]
*  Some sense that the U.S. is not the reliable partner that the rest of these nations would [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=119.92s)]
*  like. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=125.44s)]
*  And to your point, the debt ceiling clearly going to overshadow the proceedings these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=126.44s)]
*  next few days when the press pool was pulled out of that bilateral meeting just a few minutes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=129.44s)]
*  ago, all the shattered questions were about the debt ceiling, which you know the president [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=133.52s)]
*  didn't answer any of them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=137.0s)]
*  So when the G7 is here, Ukraine is going to be front of mind in the economic impact of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=138.84s)]
*  the war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=143.56s)]
*  Also, there's still some concerns potentially of a global recession. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=144.56s)]
*  What is it? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=147.36s)]
*  What's the White House trying to bring to the table tomorrow to try to try to steady [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=148.36s)]
*  some of those worries from the other member nations? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  I think the main thing they're trying to do on Ukraine is just keep everyone on board [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=155.36s)]
*  in terms of the fighting part of it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=161.6s)]
*  They're going to be reviewing the battle plans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=165.56s)]
*  This is coming at a time when Ukraine is preparing an offensive. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=167.84s)]
*  But also on the economic side, they want to make sure that the sanctions that are in place [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=171.96s)]
*  are working and that Russia is unable to evade some of those sanctions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=176.96s)]
*  And I think we're also going to see new sanctions as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  I think a year ago there was probably an expectation that Russia's economy would be completely [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  crippled by the sanctions that were put in place. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=189.46s)]
*  And we haven't seen that yet. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  So I think there's an interest in trying to sort of make sure that it'll be a tougher [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=193.78s)]
*  road for Russia as the months go forward. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=199.22s)]
*  And as of course with the debt ceiling, this so often happens as domestic matters overshadow [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  a foreign trip for any president. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=207.38s)]
*  And of course we know this president has had to cut his trip short, no longer making stops [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=208.78s)]
*  in Australia and Papua New Guinea. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=212.58s)]
*  What is the White House telling you guys there who are traveling with him as the state of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=214.1s)]
*  those talks? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=217.88s)]
*  How is the president and his staff being involved with the Republicans back here at home? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=218.88s)]
*  Well, the White House will often say that, you know, the president can be president no [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  matter where he is and that he will be in close touch with his aides, his team who are [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=227.9s)]
*  working on to try to reach a resolution on the debt ceiling. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=234.46s)]
*  The White House pointed out that Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, a very close advisor [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=238.34s)]
*  to the president who has been working on these talks, decided to travel with the president, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  I think in large part so he could continue to brief the president on the debt ceiling [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=248.62s)]
*  talks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  I think the hope is that when the president returns to Washington next week, that he'll [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  be able to usher in sort of a final negotiation and get this over the finish line. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=259.06s)]
*  It's certainly something that's just really hanging over these meetings. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=265.76s)]
*  And one more for you Ken, just give us a sense as to what went into the decision to cancel [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=269.14s)]
*  the back half of the trip. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=273.54s)]
*  We know this administration's really been trying to pivot to the Pacific, to Asia for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=274.74s)]
*  a while, that part of they really wanted to have almost a show of force, if you will, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=278.86s)]
*  a show of commitment to try to curb China's rising influence there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=283.17999999999995s)]
*  He is still going to meet with some of those same Quad leaders in Japan. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  But talk to us what went into the decision to pull down that part of the trip and frankly, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  how disappointed is the White House that they had to? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think they're certainly disappointed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=296.78s)]
*  He was going to become the first sitting president to visit a Pacific island nation if he had [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=300.26s)]
*  gone to Papua New Guinea. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=306.82s)]
*  And the Quad summit, that's become a very important group of nations to counter China. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=309.66s)]
*  But I think in the end, they just realized that they needed to get him through this G7 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=316.42s)]
*  meeting and then get him back to Washington. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  I think there was going to be a lot of criticism if this trip lingered on and we didn't have [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  any resolution to the debt ceiling problem. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  So I think they just decided in the end that there's a finite deadline with this debt ceiling. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  Whereas they can reschedule some of those stops at a later date. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=338.86s)]
*  Yeah, the G7, of course, that summit cannot really be missed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=343.22s)]
*  White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal live in Hiroshima, Japan for us, Ken Thomas. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=347.74s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=352.18s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=353.18s)]
*  Safe travels. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdbs9fBIupc&t=354.18s)]
