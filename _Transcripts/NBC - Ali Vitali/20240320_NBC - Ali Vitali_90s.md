# Appeals court puts strict Texas immigration law on hold
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU)
*  Back here at home, Texas is once again prevented from enforcing a strict new immigration law [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=0.0s)]
*  that gives police the power to arrest migrants who they suspect of crossing the border illegally. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=5.5s)]
*  The decision comes just hours after the Supreme Court said the measure, which is known as Senate Bill 4, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=10.74s)]
*  could go into effect while litigation continues. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=16.44s)]
*  This new order, issued by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals panel, voted to temporarily block the law, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  which is one of the toughest of its kind. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=25.36s)]
*  Later this very morning, the panel of judges who issued the order are set to hear arguments in the case [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=29.0s)]
*  to determine if the law should remain on hold until the court rules on SB 4's legality. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=33.9s)]
*  Earlier yesterday, the Supreme Court Justice's ruling prompted alarm among immigration advocates, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=39.6s)]
*  caused confusion along the border, and led to a show of defiance by the Mexican government, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=46.04s)]
*  which says it will refuse to accept any migrants deported by Texas. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=52.32s)]
*  The Biden administration has argued that the law conflicts with federal immigration law [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=57.78s)]
*  and that states have no authority to legislate on the issue, deeming it unconstitutional. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  We, of course, will keep you posted on this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RULwgKrRoHU&t=68.82s)]
