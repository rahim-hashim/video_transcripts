# Indiana Legislature Passes Near-Total Abortion Ban
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg)
*  Two months after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, Indiana has become the first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=0.0s)]
*  state to approve a near total ban on abortion. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=5.12s)]
*  The state legislature passed the new bill on Friday, which was immediately signed into [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=8.9s)]
*  law by Indiana's Republican governor. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Effective on September 15th, Indiana abortion clinics will lose their licenses if they perform [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=16.16s)]
*  the procedure. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=21.2s)]
*  Doctors who perform abortions illegally or those who do so legally without reporting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=22.88s)]
*  it will also lose their licenses. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  Abortions will still be legal in cases of rape and incest, but only before 10 weeks [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=30.04s)]
*  post-fertilization. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=34.96s)]
*  And the procedure will still be allowed when the health of the mother is in jeopardy or [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=36.96s)]
*  if the fetus is diagnosed with a lethal anomaly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=41.04s)]
*  Before the bill's passage, Indiana House Democrats and some of the nine Republicans who also [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=45.0s)]
*  opposed it spoke out against the new law. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=50.2s)]
*  Each one of us legislators could be raped. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=54.8s)]
*  We could have a piece of our soul ripped from us and be violated. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  But only 23% of us can know what it's like to fear that that horrific moment could create [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  a baby. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=72.14s)]
*  We are told by the Republican supermajority that you cannot legislate moral behavior when [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=73.14s)]
*  it comes to issues like gun violence in America. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=77.5s)]
*  But in a matter of two weeks, we will legislate away a woman's God-given free will to make [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=81.16s)]
*  her own decisions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  When I moved to Indiana 30 years ago, I did not have access to affordable women's health [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  care and contraceptive services. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=95.6s)]
*  As a result, I had an unplanned pregnancy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=97.96s)]
*  I ask this body not to continue to ignore the women in this body and most importantly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=100.52s)]
*  the minority women in this body who continue to speak knowledge and truth to this matter. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=106.02s)]
*  Joining us now, one of the women you just heard from, Democratic state representative [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=114.06s)]
*  from Indiana, Maureen Bauer. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=118.14s)]
*  Thank you, Representative Bauer, for being with us and we just played your comments there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=121.22s)]
*  In the days after this law was passed and signed by the governor, tell us how are your [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=126.86s)]
*  constituents reacting? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=132.5s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, thank you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=133.7s)]
*  It's clear that this was a very extreme piece of legislation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=138.22s)]
*  Women in Indiana woke up Saturday morning to learn that in the middle of the night while [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=144.42s)]
*  they were sleeping, Governor Holcomb signed this bill into law at 11 15 p.m. and woke [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=148.77999999999997s)]
*  up to learn that their rights and the rights of all childbearing women, all victims of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=156.12s)]
*  rape, sexual assault were rolled back essentially 50 years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=161.4s)]
*  Both Republican and Democrats alike in the state oppose a ban on abortion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=168.6s)]
*  Republicans took their own poll which revealed that the majority of residents in the state [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=173.96s)]
*  support the law as it remains prior to this passage of Senate Bill 1. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=178.44s)]
*  They oppose a ban on abortion. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=185.16s)]
*  And so I think the Indiana Republican Party knows they're moving us in the wrong direction. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=187.96s)]
*  They know that they're going against the will of the majority of residents here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=192.44s)]
*  And I think they know that they are catering to the extreme Republican Party, not the small [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=197.48s)]
*  government Indiana Republican Party that we once knew who valued individual freedoms and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=203.84s)]
*  privacy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=209.72s)]
*  So Indiana becomes the first state to put in place a near total ban on abortion since [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=212.28s)]
*  the Supreme Court decision certainly won't be the last. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=217.8s)]
*  Now that this has happened and it's come into law and you said signed in the dead of night [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=221.48s)]
*  on a Friday in August, what actions can you and your fellow Democrats, what if anything, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=226.32s)]
*  can you and your colleagues do to protect the rights of women in your home state? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=232.76s)]
*  Well, we know that anyone who is in those seats in January when we reconvene for a regular [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=240.56s)]
*  session will come for those narrow exemptions that were included in the bill. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=245.92s)]
*  The hardest part of that debate was listening to House Republican members go back and forth [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=252.0s)]
*  on the House floor whether they should or shouldn't allow any exemptions for victims [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=258.76s)]
*  of rape and incest, including children under the age of consent. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=265.0s)]
*  There was an amendment proposed by leadership in the House Republican Party that would have [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=269.96s)]
*  eliminated those narrow 10 weeks that were provided for incest and rape victims. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=276.56s)]
*  And we know come January they will attempt to do that again. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=283.48s)]
*  And so we are not stuck in reverse. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=287.0s)]
*  There is a path forward and that will be at the polls in November. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=290.04s)]
*  The early voting starts October 11th. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=296.44s)]
*  The speaker himself said to anyone who's unhappy with this policy, they can vote for new legislators. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=299.44s)]
*  So in a state that's heavily gerrymandered more than the rest of the country, we have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=307.0s)]
*  to show up. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=313.72s)]
*  So the answer may not be the same exact measures Kansas, but if [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  Democrats can have that same sort of enthusiasm in Indiana, that would seem to be, as you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=344.64s)]
*  say, their best option here. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=349.08s)]
*  Indiana State Representative Maureen Bauer, we really appreciate you being on with us [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=351.08s)]
*  this morning and your impassioned words on this issue. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3aSA2ADsMg&t=353.91999999999996s)]
