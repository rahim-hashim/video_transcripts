# President Biden to sign executive order to protect reproductive rights
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8)
*  Later today, President Joe Biden will sign an executive order aimed at protecting access [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=0.0s)]
*  to abortions and contraceptives nationwide. The signing is just one of several high-profile [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=5.84s)]
*  events the president and vice president are hosting to mark tomorrow's one-year anniversary [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=11.44s)]
*  of the fall of Roe v. Wade. We're here for the vice president's major speech. The president's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=17.6s)]
*  got an event at the Mayflower Hotel just up the road there in Washington. The executive order [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=21.76s)]
*  he's going to sign today aims to increase contraceptive options, lower out-of-pocket [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=25.44s)]
*  costs for reproductive care, and raise awareness about family planning choices. This is the third [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=30.32s)]
*  executive order Biden has signed related to reproductive health since the Supreme Court's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case last year. There is no timeline [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  for when private, state, or federal agencies must act in order to be compliant with the measure, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=48.56s)]
*  but the White House says the executive order highlights his administration's commitment [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=54.16s)]
*  to supporting reproductive rights. The move was endorsed by three major abortion rights groups, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=58.8s)]
*  Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL, Pro-Choice America, and EMILY's List, which are slated to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  join the president and vice president at today's order signing and endorse his re-election bid. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=69.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, new polling from NBC News shows that most voters remain opposed to the Supreme Court's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=74.56s)]
*  decision to overturn Roe. In the survey, 61% say they disapprove of the decision to remove [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=80.72s)]
*  federal protections for abortion rights. That is unchanged from the poll taken last September. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=87.52s)]
*  The new number includes not only Democrats, but also 60% of independents and almost a third [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=93.76s)]
*  of Republican voters. Joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman Charisse Davids of Kansas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=100.56s)]
*  Congresswoman, so great to see you this morning. So your home state, Kansas, was at the center of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=106.72s)]
*  the post-Roe conversation last year. That state, of course, went for Donald Trump pretty convincingly, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=111.28s)]
*  but then voted to codify abortion rights into the state constitution. So just a year out. Tell us [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=115.36s)]
*  what this moment is, both for the state of Kansas, but also the nation. Yeah, well, good morning. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=121.52s)]
*  And, you know, I think that right now what we're seeing is continued fear and anxiety that folks [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=127.52s)]
*  felt as soon as the Dobbs decision came out. And I say that because I remember viscerally, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=136.0s)]
*  I think a lot of us do, when we found out that Roe, which was 50 years of protection of a right, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=143.36s)]
*  was overturned. And in Kansas, you know, we were the first state to vote on whether or not we [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=152.16s)]
*  want to keep politicians out of very personal decisions that should be between a person and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=158.64s)]
*  their doctor and their family. And I think that people are right to still feel the same way, that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=164.4s)]
*  that was a huge step backwards and that we need to continue to protect our rights. And, you know, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=172.08s)]
*  I'm doing that by introducing—I know the president has an executive order. I'm introducing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=178.0s)]
*  legislation to make sure that access to information and contraception is going to continue, because [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=183.52s)]
*  the pushback on that has been unrelenting. Yeah, tell us a little bit more about the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  legislation you're going to bring out for women's health care, including in contraceptives. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=196.96s)]
*  What's it about and what sort of hopes you have that it could eventually become law? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=203.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, when you've got a Supreme Court justice like Clarence Thomas calling into [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=207.84s)]
*  question not just the continued right for LGBTQ-plus folks to get married, but also [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=213.68s)]
*  things like access to contraception, I think it is hugely important for those of us in the Congress to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=222.24s)]
*  introduce pieces of legislation like the one I'm introducing that will [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  protect access to family planning services, that will protect access to contraception and make sure [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  that people are not in fear of additional rights being taken away. And I actually do have hope for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=239.2s)]
*  the future of not just protecting things like contraception and family planning, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=248.16s)]
*  but also the full range of reproductive health care. When you see that that many people across [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  the country and in places like Kansas, that people do not want politicians making their [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=260.56s)]
*  private health care decisions for them, I think that the right thing for all of us to do is to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=266.48s)]
*  heed that and listen to what the people of our country are telling us. So, Congressman, let's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=274.0s)]
*  turn to the politics of it. We obviously are on the eve of an election. Polls, including the one [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=280.0s)]
*  we just showed, show that Americans, the majority of Americans believe in some sort of abortion [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  protections. It was a significant motivator, the 2022 race, and helped Democrats. Do you anticipate [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=290.08s)]
*  the same next year? What sort of energy are you feeling? Yeah, I mean, I think that it is. It's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=297.52s)]
*  actually surprising to me that we have folks who are on the other side of the aisle that continue [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=305.12s)]
*  to try to push some of these really just extreme positions. There's no other way to describe them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=312.0s)]
*  In fact, you know, in my district, where we resoundingly said, do not try to take away [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=318.8s)]
*  our rights. And I have two people who have filed against me that are wildly out of step with [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  not just my district, but the entire country on these issues. And I think that, you know, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=335.52s)]
*  the voters are going to continue to show up and make sure that we continue to push back on these [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=340.56s)]
*  extreme policies, just like we did last November. Democratic Congresswoman Sharice Davids of Kansas, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=346.72s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m99oiMNawO8&t=352.96000000000004s)]
