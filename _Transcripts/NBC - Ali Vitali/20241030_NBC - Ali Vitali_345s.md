# Michelle Obama hosts rally urging voters to polls
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74)
*  Former first lady Michelle Obama was in Georgia last night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=0.0s)]
*  speaking at a star-studded rally for her nonpartisan organization, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=2.88s)]
*  When We All Vote. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=6.84s)]
*  This event was focused on mobilizing young, first-time voters [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=8.64s)]
*  before early voting in Georgia ends on Friday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=11.72s)]
*  Mrs. Obama tailored her speech to the young people in the crowd. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=14.52s)]
*  So many folks, particularly our young people, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=19.56s)]
*  are struggling to find their footing in this world, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=22.44s)]
*  battling higher levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, frustration. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=26.159999999999997s)]
*  More folks feel disillusioned, helpless to affect change in their own lives. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=32.44s)]
*  That makes them increasingly more apathetic. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=39.72s)]
*  And as a result, our priorities have gotten a little off whack. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=43.32s)]
*  We got a lot of folks thirsty for likes from their followers, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=48.2s)]
*  but uninterested in the needs of their communities. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=52.6s)]
*  We got folks excited to vote on reality shows, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=57.28s)]
*  but not willing to vote for their actual reality. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=61.52s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter at the Washington Post, Tyler Pager. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=67.28s)]
*  Tyler, good to see you again. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=70.56s)]
*  So that was a nonpartisan event, but we certainly know [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=72.16s)]
*  the Harris campaign is really trying to court young voters. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, per polling, has made some inroads, particularly with young men. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=77.64s)]
*  The Harris campaign trying to energize the young, the progressives. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  How do they feel six days ago that they're doing? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=84.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think we've seen that same sort of rhetoric from Vice President Harris [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=87.2s)]
*  as I've traveled with her around the country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=91.04s)]
*  She has added to her speech a direct appeal to young voters, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  trying to make it very clear to them why they need to turn out and vote. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=96.64s)]
*  I think they're optimistic that the numbers are increasing, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=100.28s)]
*  the enthusiasm is increasing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, there were thousands of people on the National Mall [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  at the Lips last night watching her speech. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=107.0s)]
*  And that's why they're bringing these celebrities along, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=109.56s)]
*  Maggie Rogers, the celebrities with Michelle Obama, Beyonce. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  These are all part of those efforts to try to mobilize and energize young voters. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=115.6s)]
*  I think it's a little early to say what we know about the early vote numbers, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  but there's a clear overt push to try to get them out to the polls [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  with just a few days left. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=126.36s)]
*  Yeah, and with the race so very tight. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=127.32s)]
*  So we've been talking all morning about the last few days, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=129.4s)]
*  about Donald Trump's rally at Masquerade, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=132.24s)]
*  and the comedian who referred to Puerto Rico as an island full of garbage. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=134.28s)]
*  President Joe Biden weighed in last night and kind of kicked off a bit of a firestorm. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  He gave a Zoom call with Latino supporters. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=140.68s)]
*  And in his remarks, the White House says he was talking about the comedian [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=144.04s)]
*  and that the supporter, Donald Trump's supporter, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=148.28s)]
*  meaning the comedian, was garbage. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  His hateful rhetoric was garbage. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=152.72s)]
*  Those on the right have suggested that no, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=154.6s)]
*  that Biden was actually referring to all of Trump's supporters as garbage [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=156.68s)]
*  while he was weighing in and trying to talk about the remarks from the weekend. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=159.64s)]
*  It's a bit of a tempest this morning. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=164.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=165.92s)]
*  And I think this is why the Harris campaign has been very cautious [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=167.0s)]
*  about how they have deployed the president as a surrogate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=172.44s)]
*  They feel that he is helpful in certain areas of the country, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=175.64s)]
*  particularly maybe some of those white, more working class areas of Pennsylvania. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=179.24s)]
*  We're seeing him slated to go to Scranton, his birthplace, over the weekend. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=183.56s)]
*  But it is a risk that when they put him out, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=188.32s)]
*  he has had some high profile gaffes in New Hampshire when he said, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=190.56s)]
*  we should lock him up, and then very quickly corrected, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=195.12s)]
*  we should lock him up politically talking about Donald Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=197.8s)]
*  It is something that the Harris campaign is navigating [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  as they're trying to figure out how to deploy the president in the final days [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=203.32000000000002s)]
*  and try to avoid some of these gaffes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=207.52s)]
*  I think one of the concerns for the Harris campaign [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=209.24s)]
*  is that they felt pretty good about the vice president's speech last night, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=211.56s)]
*  the closing arguments she delivered on the lips, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=214.44s)]
*  the contrast she painted with Donald Trump. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=216.36s)]
*  And now a lot of the conversation this morning, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  and I'm sure it will continue throughout the day, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  is what the president said, Joe Biden, and not what the vice president said. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=222.56s)]
*  And just any sort of distraction at this point, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=225.44s)]
*  taking Kamala Harris out of the spotlight, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  out of the message she's trying to drive home, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=230.24s)]
*  is a concern for the Democrats as they close out the campaign. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=233.0s)]
*  Yeah, Biden tweeted last night that, again, he was referring to the comedian, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  not all of Trump's supporters. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=238.52s)]
*  But you're right, he's targeted events. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  I was traveling with him yesterday in Baltimore. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  He spoke to union workers. He did an event at an ice cream shop. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=243.0s)]
*  He spoke to union workers again on Philadelphia on Friday. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  I know you're on Air Force Two today, traveling with the vice president. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=248.4s)]
*  Give us a preview of where she's going. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah, barnstorming the battleground states. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=252.84s)]
*  We're starting the morning in Raleigh, North Carolina, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=255.0s)]
*  then moving on to Pennsylvania, I think, including in Wisconsin and Madison. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=256.88s)]
*  Again, as we were talking about trying to get to early, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=260.16s)]
*  trying to get to young voters, right near the University of Wisconsin, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=262.96s)]
*  a big rally with a lot of popular musicians, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=266.24s)]
*  this sort of outdoor concert mobilization effort. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=270.08s)]
*  So this is, you know, she's really trying to hit all these battleground states [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=272.96s)]
*  and make these final appeals and get voters to the polls. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=276.88s)]
*  I think a lot of this at this point is mobilization, is not necessarily, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=280.48s)]
*  you know, they're trying to persuade people, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=284.84s)]
*  trying to get undecided people off the sidelines. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=286.24s)]
*  But really, it's about pushing people to the polls, getting them excited, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=288.64s)]
*  getting them motivated to cast their ballots. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=292.04s)]
*  I think that's one of the things they're fighting against, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=294.48s)]
*  is this apathy among particularly young voters, communities of color, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=296.76s)]
*  about trying to convince them, you know, not why the stakes matter, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=300.04s)]
*  but also just to get to the polls to vote. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=303.84s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what we're going to see over the next few days [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=305.92s)]
*  with these big rallies with celebrities, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=307.64s)]
*  musicians, all part of that effort. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=309.2s)]
*  As some insiders say, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=310.84s)]
*  choosing the ballot box over the couch, get out there, actually vote. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=311.68s)]
*  White House reporter at The Washington Post, Tyler Pager, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=314.84s)]
*  thank you. Safe travels today. We appreciate it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  And thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=319.84s)]
*  on this Wednesday morning. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=322.52s)]
*  Morning Joe starts right now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgdSJbzvx74&t=323.84s)]
