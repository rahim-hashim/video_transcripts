# Lt. Gov. Fetterman On 2022 Senate Bid, Raising Minimum Wage | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ)
*  Welcome back. Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama has announced he won't be seeking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=0.0s)]
*  reelection in 2022. Shelby, who is 86 years old, is currently serving his sixth term in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=5.44s)]
*  the Senate. He was chairman of the Appropriations Committee until Democrats recently took control [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=11.84s)]
*  of the chamber. Shelby's seat is among 20 GOP-held Senate seats that will be contested [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=16.12s)]
*  in the next midterm elections, and he's the fourth Republican senator to announce plans [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=21.52s)]
*  to step down next year following Senators Rob Portman of Ohio, Richard Burr of North Carolina, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=25.52s)]
*  and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. That Shelby seat is not going to be competitive, but the one in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=30.92s)]
*  Pennsylvania will be. Joining us now is Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=35.8s)]
*  He announced yesterday that he will be running in 2022 for the Senate seat that Toomey is leaving. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=40.32s)]
*  Lieutenant Governor, thank you very much for getting up so early with us to talk about this, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  and I know I want to talk about the Hoagie Wars in Pennsylvania in a second, but let's start with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=51.28s)]
*  politics, because you have cut an interesting figure for Democrats in the state of Pennsylvania, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=57.36s)]
*  in some ways looking to some of those voters that perhaps backed Donald Trump in recent [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=64.8s)]
*  presidential elections. So let's start with an issue that's facing the Senate right now, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  and that's the minimum wage. Bernie Sanders is pushing for them to include a $15 [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=75.44s)]
*  minimum wage in this big coronavirus relief package, but there's some concern it could lead [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=80.48s)]
*  to job losses. Where do you come down on this? Should they raise the minimum wage to $15, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=85.28s)]
*  even if there's some job loss as a result? Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I put out a tweet [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=89.68s)]
*  yesterday and I think it's up to 125,000 likes. I mean, it went nuts. I mean, it's just like, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=95.12s)]
*  if you don't support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, you should live and work for $7.25 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=101.2s)]
*  an hour. So you can demonstrate how you survive, let alone feed a family on that, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=107.28s)]
*  because it's just a mathematical impossibility. So I don't know why we're pretending that leaving [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=112.16s)]
*  that alone at $7.25 is okay. I mean, it's great to give stimulus checks. People deserve them and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=117.36s)]
*  they need them during this pandemic. But why not give people a lifeline, you know, out of that kind [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=122.88s)]
*  of below the poverty line deprivation and give them a baseline of a living wage of $15 an hour? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=129.04s)]
*  That to me would be a hard flex. So the Biden administration also out of the gate [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=136.24s)]
*  pulled out of the Keystone pipeline project, which again is energy related. And obviously a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  lot of folks in Western Pennsylvania rely on the energy industry for their jobs to feed their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  families. Do you think that was a good call by the Biden team? I mean, it certainly, I don't think [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=154.88s)]
*  it was one that Joe Biden went into and didn't put a lot of thought into it. And I'm sure he is, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=160.8s)]
*  I know he's concerned about any of the potential job losses out West here. It's definitely a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=165.6s)]
*  conversation that we've had with respects to the energy sector. And I've always maintained the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=170.72s)]
*  position of, of Republicans have to acknowledge the emergency that we have with climate and that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=175.68s)]
*  we need to transition away from fossil fuels to green renewable energy. And Democrats, my party [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=181.84s)]
*  has to acknowledge that there are realities with respects to energy, whether that's how, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  and how much of our nation's electricity comes from coal and natural gas and making sure that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=193.44s)]
*  we safe safeguard those union jobs and make sure that those industries have a transition [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=199.2s)]
*  towards green energy where job loss is eliminated or at least at a minimum, minimized. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=206.8s)]
*  Let's talk briefly about the vaccine rollout in Pennsylvania. Also there've been some struggles [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  in the state, Philadelphia in particular has really struggled. What do you think the Wolf [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=218.48s)]
*  administration that you're a part of, the governor in Pennsylvania, what mistakes [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  have been made in the rollout? What needs to be fixed? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=227.12s)]
*  Well, I don't necessarily think any mistakes were made with the governor. I can't speak to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  Philadelphia situation. I know some local officials picked an operation that turned out not to be what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=235.36s)]
*  it was, but with respects to the governor, I do know that we have had zero leadership from a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  federal level for months and months and months up until only when Joe Biden took office. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  And when you have a pandemic that's now almost been a year long and you have two weeks of a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  president who says, hey, it's okay to wear a mask. Hey, this virus we need to take seriously. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=260.96s)]
*  Republicans wouldn't even wear masks in the Senate chambers in Pennsylvania. And they claim that they [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  weren't afraid of this virus. So the vaccine rollout was a logistical challenge and it's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=272.08s)]
*  ramping up and it's getting going. I know a lot of people that have been successful in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=277.76s)]
*  getting their vaccination and I have not, nor would I until any Pennsylvanian can walk into [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=282.08s)]
*  a Rite Aid and get the shot. Right. All right. So before I let you go, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=289.12s)]
*  Wawa, I'm sorry, they have the best hoagies in the state of Pennsylvania. I don't understand [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=296.08s)]
*  how there's even a conversation about Wawa versus Sheetz. I just, I just can't. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=301.44s)]
*  I heard you say that. Yeah. You know, a Wawa fan is a Pennsylvania resident who's been unlucky [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  enough to never been to a Sheetz. And I think that's true. And then again, Wawa is great [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=312.56s)]
*  when you're 50 miles or more from a Sheetz. That's always been my philosophy. That's how I [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=318.48s)]
*  bring Pennsylvanians together with that. It's like Sheetz of course is better, but if you're [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=322.48s)]
*  50 miles away from a Sheetz, Wawa is an outstanding option. Truly. I've been to many. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=327.6s)]
*  I am willing to accept, I'm willing to accept the reverse of that, which is I will go to Sheetz [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=333.12s)]
*  if there is no Wawa available. Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman, thank you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  very much for being here and indulging in a little bit of, of Pennsylvania fun. Thank you very much. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  We will be following your campaign. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qEwV4ff0NQ&t=347.76000000000005s)]
