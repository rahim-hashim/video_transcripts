# Trump vows to escalate attacks against DA Bragg: Guardian
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is vowing to escalate his attacks against Manhattan District [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=2.32s)]
*  Attorney Alvin Bragg following the announcement of his indictment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=7.16s)]
*  The Guardian's reporting that Trump told people close to him over the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=11.08s)]
*  Resort in Florida that he wants to go on the offensive, use more colorful language, and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=15.6s)]
*  that it's time to politically rough him up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=21.88s)]
*  Former President followed up by posting his fair share of attacks against Bragg and other [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=25.959999999999997s)]
*  attorneys over the weekend on his fledgling social media platform. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=30.2s)]
*  Trump also criticized Bragg's wife. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=34.2s)]
*  Joining us now is the author of that new report, political investigations reporter for The [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=37.12s)]
*  Guardian, Hugo Lowell. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=41.16s)]
*  Hugo, good morning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=43.28s)]
*  Take us behind closed doors, if you will, and give us more from this meeting that Trump [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=44.76s)]
*  held at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, just days before his historic indictment. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=49.88s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think the posts about Bragg's wife kind of underscores where Trump is with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  respect to his attacks on the Manhattan D.A. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=61.88s)]
*  You know, it's exactly the kind of thing that Trump likes to go after. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=64.28s)]
*  You know, he was telling aides he wanted to kind of savage Bragg. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  I think he, you know, he feels very wronged by prosecutors because he feels like the case [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=70.68s)]
*  was resurrected and then kind of stood up to come after him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=76.48s)]
*  And so, you know, his response has been, well, then I'm going to attack them back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  And front and center is, you know, the personal attacks, the political attacks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=86.48s)]
*  And he sees a political benefit for his campaign as well. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=89.76s)]
*  He likes to be seen as a fighter. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=92.64s)]
*  He wants his supporters to see him kind of lashing back at prosecutors and now the judge. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=94.08s)]
*  And so I think this is just the first step towards more escalatory rhetoric from the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=99.6s)]
*  former president. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=105.04s)]
*  We heard from our friend, Danny Savalas, the legal expert earlier, suggesting that a gag [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=106.64s)]
*  order in this case was unlikely, but not impossible. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  Is there any concern in Trump's orbit that if he continues to go after Bragg and some [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=115.4s)]
*  of the stuff has been downright dangerous, if he continues to go after Bragg, could he [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=119.7s)]
*  risk a gag order or even potentially an additional criminal charge? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  Look, I think it's very possible that there's a gag order in this case. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=129.12s)]
*  I mean, we've seen gag order in previous kind of Trump adjacent cases with people like Roger [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=132.4s)]
*  Stone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=136.88s)]
*  But that was more to do with when he went after witnesses. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=137.88s)]
*  It's going to be interesting because Trump does have a real inability to, I think, assert [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  self-discipline when it comes to, you know, social media posts and attacks on people. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=147.4s)]
*  And so if there is a gag order, I think it would be very, very tricky for him not to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=152.04s)]
*  violate it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=156.6s)]
*  And he was he's going to have to take extra care, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=157.6s)]
*  And if he does violate it, that is going to be a legal problem for him that he has not [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=159.64s)]
*  had to encounter before. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, the courts take this kind of thing very seriously. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  If you violate a gag or gag order, you being contempt and most certainly would lead to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  I believe you just said that Trump has shown an inability to exhibit self-discipline when [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  it comes to social media. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  That is an early candidate for understatement of the day. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  Hugo, you know, we know that the Trump team thinks they can benefit politically from this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  indictment, at least in the short term. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  Walk us through the dynamic and tell us what they're looking for from his other potential [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=191.0s)]
*  Republican challengers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=196.4s)]
*  I mean, I think you're already seeing the net effect of this indictment giving him a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=198.88s)]
*  political boost. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=203.0s)]
*  I mean, over the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, Trump was also kind of pivoting his focus to the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=204.0s)]
*  political benefits that have come, including how people like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=208.24s)]
*  have had to fall back in line and defend him. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=213.08s)]
*  I think he's noted this with great satisfaction that these candidates who are hoping to depose [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=217.12s)]
*  him and to kind of beat him in the primary now have to defend him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=222.8s)]
*  And that is because the MAGA base is still a core part of the Republican primary voting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=227.24s)]
*  set. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=233.12s)]
*  And he knows and they know that they cannot hit him too hard because then the base will [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=234.12s)]
*  never vote for them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=241.12s)]
*  And so I think he's looking at this with real satisfaction, especially when it comes to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=242.12s)]
*  polling over the weekend. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=245.6s)]
*  There were two new polls that came out about how Trump was ahead post-indictment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=246.88s)]
*  And they're also looking at the fundraising numbers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=252.96s)]
*  You raised the five million dollar number earlier. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=254.6s)]
*  And I think even if that is not the biggest hole he has had in the 48 hours after indictment, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  that's not something that any other candidate would have been able to get. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=264.08s)]
*  And Hugo, lastly, just walk us through as best you know what Trump's day is going to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=268.56s)]
*  look like. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=271.64s)]
*  He said he's leaving around noon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=272.64s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago heading to New York City. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  What will he do once he reaches Trump Tower to prepare for tomorrow? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=276.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the schedule that's being circled around is he wants he's going to leave [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  Palm Beach around 12 or 1 tomorrow. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=284.16s)]
*  He's then going to fly into LaGuardia and spend the night at Trump Tower in the morning, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  possibly quite early. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  He's going to head to the courthouse at 80 Center Street in Lower Manhattan by motorcade. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=293.08000000000004s)]
*  He will go in. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=298.68s)]
*  He will be fingerprinted. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=299.68s)]
*  And he may be photographed, right? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=300.68s)]
*  This is one of the points that is not certain. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=302.04s)]
*  Trump wants a mugshot because, you know, as he has been telling aides, maybe they could [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=304.52s)]
*  put it on a t-shirt and he could kind of hold himself up to someone like Che Guevara and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=308.2s)]
*  sell the t-shirts to his supporters. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=312.24s)]
*  But then the moment they're done, they're going to go straight back to Palm Beach for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=314.12s)]
*  a press conference. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=316.96s)]
*  We will ignore the comparison there. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=319.16s)]
*  Political Investigations reporter for The Guardian, Hugo Lowell, thank you. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=321.72s)]
*  And I'm sure we'll be speaking to you again this week. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=324.12s)]
*  We appreciate your reporting. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6xNU-jukbw&t=325.84s)]
