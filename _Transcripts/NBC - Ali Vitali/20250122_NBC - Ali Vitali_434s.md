*  the end of this month for dismissing their employees. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=119.86s)]
*  It's unclear how many people would be affected. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  The White House did not immediately respond to NBC [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  News for comment. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=127.36s)]
*  President Trump signed an executive order Monday ending [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=128.84s)]
*  those D.E.I. programs in federal agencies. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=131.34s)]

*  Americans who want to serve but are unable to as they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=142.14s)]

*  drill down on this D.E.I. initiatives piece for a moment [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=154.58s)]
*  because there's research that shows diversity is a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=157.66000000000003s)]
*  strength that makes organizations stronger whether [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=160.52s)]
*  federal or private. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=163.02s)]
*  So what's the argument behind the scenes for getting rid of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=164.62s)]
*  the D.E.I. initiatives is it just for getting rid of woke. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=167.46s)]
*  Yeah I think that that frankly is the argument I mean I [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  think that you know as well as I do that there are a few [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=173.72s)]
*  things that President Trump said in those rallies more [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=176.66s)]
*  than that he would get rid of the woke ideology and he [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  would get rid of D.E.I. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=182.85999999999999s)]
*  practices and instead put back what they call meritocracy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=184.06s)]
*  type style governments where people are where basically [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=188.06s)]
*  it's race blinds right people are promoted by their own [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=191.1s)]
*  merits they say and so they believe that this is a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  fulfillment of those promises that Trump made on the stage [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  that various rallies over the last two years and frankly [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  these are policies that in at least some ways haven't [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=203.96s)]
*  thought out for years by the think tanks that were kind of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  doing these type of policy papers in between the Trump's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=210.4s)]
*  first and now this term and so these are things that they [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=214.24s)]
*  believe are really well thought out and I think that one [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=217.44s)]
*  thing that people aren't necessarily talking about is not [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  just the fact that these people are going to be placed on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=222.02s)]
*  administrative leave potentially being terminated once [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  they figure out maybe a better way to do that because they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=226.78s)]
*  are government employees or these contractors are contracted [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=229.4s)]
*  by the federal government but also in these templates [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=232.5s)]
*  they're asking people within these agencies to then report [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  their fellow colleagues or contractors who they believe [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=240.18s)]
*  their ambition is to do D.E.I. policies but they're worded [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=245.08s)]
*  differently and so I think that you're going to see a lot [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=251.08s)]
*  more of things happening from these memorandums and these [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  D.E.I. initiatives that they're just kind of putting in place [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=257.58000000000004s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=261.22s)]
*  You covered the 2024 campaign. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=262.06s)]
*  Are there things that Trump promised he would do that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  haven't yet come out in these executive orders? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=266.8s)]
*  I know they've been sweeping but are there gaps that you're [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=269.36s)]
*  seeing in the promises made, promises kept? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=271.8s)]
*  Sure, well I think tariffs is a huge one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=274.0s)]
*  He obviously said previously that he would start tariffs [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  on day one. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  We haven't seen any indication that those are on the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  pipeline. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=282.88s)]
*  They talk about them but we saw executive orders they wanted [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=283.72s)]
*  to study them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=286.64s)]
*  Obviously deportations is something that they talked about [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  that they would do on day one. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=290.38s)]
*  That hasn't started in earnest. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=291.52s)]
*  Obviously they're talking about ramping it up now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=292.98s)]
*  There's, I reported that they kind of wanted DHS [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=295.46s)]
*  Secretary Christie Noem to be in position before they really [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=298.82s)]
*  started a whole scale revitalization of the immigration [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=301.7s)]
*  process so those are some of the major things that he [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=305.3s)]
*  promised on day one that haven't been done but I think [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=308.54s)]
*  you can kind of go through the litany of things that he [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=310.88s)]
*  promised throughout those two years of rallies to see what [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=312.8s)]
*  is and what isn't being done but certainly they don't [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  believe that DEI would be on that list. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=317.76s)]
*  Absolutely and I think when you do go through that list [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  you see a lot of those executive orders, the kernels of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=322.14s)]
*  them go from campaign trail to actual policy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=325.2s)]
*  Immediately then you saw the birthright citizenship [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=328.58s)]
*  efforts that he put forward, challenged in court. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=331.18s)]
*  You were just talking to Sky Perryman in the last block [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=333.68s)]
*  about the future legal efforts. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=336.32s)]
*  I think a lot is gonna be tied up in court. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=337.76s)]
*  Do you think that does anything to deter or change the way [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=339.82s)]
*  the administration goes about some of these actions? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=342.62s)]
*  I actually don't. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=345.4s)]
*  I think a lot of these things like birthright, like some of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  their immigration policies, they want the Supreme Court to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=348.88s)]
*  take up because then the Supreme Court can make that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=351.08s)]
*  final decision. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=353.48s)]
*  Some of these executive orders or these bills that they're [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  putting past are kind of fodder for these legal actions [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceUs8SPdzOw&t=356.62s)]
