# DOJ holds off on charging co-conspirators
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE)
*  We return now to our top story and Donald Trump's attorneys appear to have confirmed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=0.0s)]
*  one of the allegations in the special counsel's indictment. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=6.18s)]
*  Trump is accused of asking his then vice president, Mike Pence, to stop the election certification [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=10.34s)]
*  process even allegedly telling Pence he's quote, too honest when he rejected that idea. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=15.64s)]
*  Attorney John Laro provided more insight on those conversations just hours after Trump [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=23.28s)]
*  pleaded not guilty in a Washington, D.C. courthouse yesterday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=29.36s)]
*  President Trump was getting advice from an esteemed constitutional scholar as to an array [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  of options that he could take in light of the discrepancies and what was going on in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=39.56s)]
*  2020. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=44.64s)]
*  Those discrepancies were well known and they were being litigated. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=46.2s)]
*  Professor Eastman laid out a series of options that were discussed with Vice President Pence. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Vice President Pence disagreed on certain issues but ultimately what President Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=58.96s)]
*  said is let's go with option D. Let's just halt, let's just pause the voting and allow [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=62.04s)]
*  the state legislatures to take one last look and make a determination as to whether or [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=67.6s)]
*  not the elections were handled fairly. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=73.24s)]
*  That's constitutional law. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=75.92s)]
*  That's not an issue of criminal activity. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=77.56s)]
*  Laro also says the Department of Justice is violating the Constitution by pushing for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=82.0s)]
*  an earlier trial date, potentially as soon as this spring. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional correspondent for the New York Times, Luke Broadwater, who [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=92.52s)]
*  has been following this investigation for months and months. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=96.28s)]
*  Luke, in your latest reporting, you take a look at the possible reasons why Special Counsel [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=99.88s)]
*  Jack Smith has not indicted any of the co-conspiracies in the matter. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=104.64s)]
*  Media outlets have identified some of them, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, the like. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=111.84s)]
*  One theory as to why Smith did not bring charges is that he's hoping they'll flip. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=116.06s)]
*  A second is that he wants to bring, to prosecute Trump's case that much faster. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=121.58s)]
*  Walk us through what could be going on here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=127.66s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=129.66s)]
*  I mean, there are a number of considerations when a prosecutor brings an indictment and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=130.66s)]
*  determines who to name and who to charge. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  And one of them always is that the defendant has to have a fair shot at a defense. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=140.82s)]
*  Right, that's paramount in the courts. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=146.54s)]
*  But there's another political consideration on the table in terms of the timetable, and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=149.54s)]
*  that is if Donald Trump wins and is elected president, he can essentially make this case [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=155.54s)]
*  go away. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=162.94s)]
*  So this trial needs to wrap up within less than a year and a half. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=163.94s)]
*  And one way to make it faster is to make it simpler. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=169.54s)]
*  Make it about one person, not bog it down with a bunch of co-conspirators. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  And if you do name a bunch of different people and charge them, well, that creates more complications, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=178.18s)]
*  slows the trial down more. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=184.7s)]
*  And we know Donald Trump's number one strategy in court is to delay, delay, delay. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  And in this case, delaying could actually mean that the case is dropped. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=191.66s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=196.34s)]
*  The other, of course, as you mentioned, is the potential of putting the squeeze on some [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=197.62s)]
*  of these other co-conspirators who have not been named, have not been charged. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=202.66s)]
*  We in the media know who they are. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  But then seeing if they will then provide more information in exchange for not being [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  charged. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  And we'll know more about the trial schedule at the end of the month, but there's certainly [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  a prevailing theory that this one might go first next year, even before the classified [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=221.5s)]
*  documents case, which did, of course, ramp up earlier. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=226.62s)]
*  So, Luke, earlier in the show, we played sound from a very angry Kevin McCarthy doing a lot [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=229.62s)]
*  of what aboutism about other election protests. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  None of it was true. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=240.46s)]
*  But I'm more curious as to what your latest reporting tells us as to how the House Republicans [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=242.0s)]
*  are going to respond to all of this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  They're on recess now, that's sure, to be sure. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=247.34s)]
*  But are they going to ramp up either, A, the investigations to Hunter Biden, which we keep [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=249.22000000000003s)]
*  hearing the equivalencies about falsely, or do we think that McCarthy, after walking, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=253.66s)]
*  after seemingly tapping the brakes on an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, might start going [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=259.26s)]
*  full steam ahead? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  I think that they that both of those things are likely to happen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=268.06s)]
*  The investigation into Hunter Biden will continue to ramp up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=273.06s)]
*  We know that they have a number of his former business partners that they're demanding to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=278.22s)]
*  interview. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=283.22s)]
*  They believe that as much as they can keep Hunter Biden and allegations against Joe Biden, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=284.82000000000005s)]
*  even if they're unverified, in the news, that it creates a situation where voters think, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=291.82000000000005s)]
*  well, I don't know, both of these guys sound bad. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Trump's charged and he's indicted. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  But I hear these other allegations about Biden as well. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  And it becomes some sort of gray area in voters' minds. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=306.62s)]
*  So they want to keep that going. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  And then Kevin McCarthy also has floated the idea of impeachment. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=313.18s)]
*  And it does seem like there's increasingly a clamoring on the right for him to go forward [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=317.58000000000004s)]
*  with that after the August recess. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=322.62s)]
*  Congressional correspondent for The New York Times, Luke Broadwater, thank you for joining [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=326.58000000000004s)]
*  us this morning. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  We will definitely talk to you again soon. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YppFjPIEndE&t=330.90000000000003s)]
