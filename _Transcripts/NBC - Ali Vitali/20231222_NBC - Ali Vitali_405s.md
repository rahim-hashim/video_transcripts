# Hostage talks stall after Hamas demands ceasefire
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew)
*  It appears hostage negotiations have stalled after Israel rejected a Hamas demand to permanently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=0.0s)]
*  stop the fighting. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  In response, Hamas announced yesterday it would not resume negotiations unless its request [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=8.88s)]
*  is met. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=14.26s)]
*  Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reiterating his vow to destroy Hamas, saying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=15.58s)]
*  Israel is fighting until victory. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=20.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, a senior Israeli official says while there are currently no hostage negotiations, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=22.96s)]
*  there is progress in talks potentially restarting. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=29.14s)]
*  Israeli officials have been meeting with the leaders of Qatar, who have been mediating [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=32.78s)]
*  the discussion with Hamas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=37.22s)]
*  Joining us now, spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=40.3s)]
*  office, Tal Heinrich. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=45.7s)]
*  Tal, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=46.7s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=48.5s)]
*  Let's quickly talk about these efforts to renew the hostage talks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  Where do things currently stand? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=54.8s)]
*  Thank you, Sam, for having me on this morning. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=57.98s)]
*  You see, we will continue to pursue every possible avenue to bring about the release [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=60.14s)]
*  of our hostages and to also eliminate the Hamas terrorist regime. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=65.18s)]
*  We have defined two goals for this war that Hamas has dragged us into when they launched [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=69.5s)]
*  it on us with the October 7th massacre. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=74.26s)]
*  One is that Hamas will no longer be in control of the Gaza Strip, and second, that all hostages [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=77.06s)]
*  will come back home. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=81.98s)]
*  We will leave nobody behind. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=83.06s)]
*  We're proud to be part of this nation that is very, very committed to this concept. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=85.62s)]
*  Now, as you see, these two goals, they go hand in hand. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  They're not contradictory. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  The only reason as for why we have seen the release of some of the hostages by Hamas so [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=95.26s)]
*  far as per the outline that was agreed upon back in November was because we have exerted [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=99.7s)]
*  and we continue to exert very heavy military pressure on Hamas. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=107.06s)]
*  We're hitting them hard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=110.86000000000001s)]
*  We're killing thousands of terrorists. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=111.98s)]
*  We're dealing with their massive terror infrastructure, eliminating that too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=114.62s)]
*  So they wanted to breathe their last time, and that's what created the condition for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=118.94s)]
*  an agreement, the one that Hamas broke on December 1st, when they failed to deliver [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=124.02s)]
*  another group of hostages to be released and also started firing at our forces. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=129.18s)]
*  Tal, I think it's fair to say that international opinion and some domestic U.S. opinion has [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=133.54s)]
*  been quite critical of Israeli operations. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=139.84s)]
*  Now, the White House itself has become more open about the desire to see Israel scale [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  back its military operation in order to save civilian lives. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=147.62s)]
*  We now have reports from inside Gaza of some 20,000 people killed overall during the campaign. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=150.62s)]
*  What is your government's response to international opinion, to those White House calls for more [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=158.34s)]
*  civilian lives to be saved and to the reports of the 20,000 death toll being hit? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=165.18s)]
*  So, Sam, a few things to unpack here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=171.62s)]
*  You're asking me about the PR war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=175.3s)]
*  First, you have to remember that we're not fighting this war to get more likes on social [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=177.22s)]
*  media or better handshakes at the U.N. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=182.9s)]
*  corridors. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  We're fighting an existential genocidal threat called Hamas, the same terrorists who committed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  the October 7th massacre, who burned entire families alive, who raped Israeli women, who [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=192.78s)]
*  mutilated Israelis and killed 1,200 Israelis and are still holding 129 of our people hostage. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=197.9s)]
*  So, yes, there is international pressure. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=206.62s)]
*  But first, you know, we're not going to commit a public suicide because of international [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=210.22s)]
*  pressure. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=214.62s)]
*  We are acting out of self-defense, and we're seeking accountability here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=215.62s)]
*  And we are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=220.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=223.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=226.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=229.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=232.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=235.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=238.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=241.3s)]
*  We are not going to commit a public suicide because of international pressure. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=244.3s)]
*  That's all Hamas is doing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=247.3s)]
*  Atal, I just want to jump back at that question. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=249.3s)]
*  The administration, the Biden administration, has been more open about its desire to see [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=253.3s)]
*  Israel be more strategic and surgical and spare civilian lives in its operations. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=258.3s)]
*  Does the Netanyahu government continue to have solid relations with the Biden administration? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=264.3s)]
*  Do they feel like there's being more pressure put on them by the Biden administration to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=269.3s)]
*  be more cognizant of those civilian casualties? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=273.3s)]
*  Well, Sowers is not a word that applies here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=277.3s)]
*  Secretary Lloyd Austin was just here a few days ago, and he reiterated that the U.S. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=280.3s)]
*  support to Israel's effort here is unshakable. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=287.3s)]
*  And Secretary Blinken just spoke a few days ago and also said things in that nature. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=291.3s)]
*  We are in lockstep with Washington. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=298.3s)]
*  Jerusalem and Washington see eye to eye in what pertains to the goals of this war. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=300.3s)]
*  We all want to see Hamas gone. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=306.3s)]
*  We all want to see the hostages back. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=308.3s)]
*  And we all want to see the minimal civilian suffering and civilian casualties in Gaza. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=310.3s)]
*  Now, we want to be able to do a better job. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=314.3s)]
*  And we are doing unprecedented efforts that no other Western military, no other military [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=317.3s)]
*  has ever done in urban warfare. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=323.3s)]
*  We are announcing ahead of time exactly where and when our troops are going to operate and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=326.3s)]
*  warning the civilians, asking them to evacuate to safer zones that we have designated. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=331.3s)]
*  We have secured humanitarian corridors. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=336.3s)]
*  There's no kind of, you know, limit on humanitarian aid in terms of food and water entering the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=339.3s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=345.3s)]
*  So the efforts that the IDF is taking here are really unprecedented. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=346.3s)]
*  If you compare us to Perfret, you know, it all depends what's the benchmark here, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=351.3s)]
*  If you compare Israel to perfection, then, well, it's a different conversation. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=355.3s)]
*  But if you compare Israel to Western military campaigns, to the battle of Mosul, Afghanistan, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=360.3s)]
*  Iraq, such campaigns, well, you know, the civilian to combat casualty ratio in that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=367.3s)]
*  war, I think it speaks for itself. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=373.3s)]
*  We're doing a much better job. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=375.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=377.3s)]
*  Spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Tal Heinrich, thank you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=378.3s)]
*  very much. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=382.3s)]
*  Really appreciate you joining us. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=383.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_-2uX2zVew&t=390.3s)]
