# Nikki Haley says Trump and Vance 'need to change the way they speak about women'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M)
*  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley says that Donald Trump and his running mate need to change their rhetoric [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Good luck with that during an interview on Fox News yesterday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=6.08s)]
*  Haley was asked why she thinks Kamala Harris currently is in the lead among female voters [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=9.36s)]
*  Here's some of what Haley had to say. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=14.84s)]
*  I think it's because [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=18.32s)]
*  Donald Trump and JD Vance need to change the way they speak about women. You don't need to call Kamala dumb [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=19.88s)]
*  She didn't get this far, you know [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=26.04s)]
*  Just by accident she's here. That's what it is. She's a prosecutor [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=28.64s)]
*  You don't need to go and talk about intelligence or looks or anything else [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=32.5s)]
*  Just focus on the policies when you call even a Democrat woman dumb [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=37.0s)]
*  Republican women get their backs up to the bottom line is we win on policies stick to the policies leave all the other stuff [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=42.86s)]
*  That's how he can win [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=50.2s)]
*  Meanwhile new polling shows a tight race in two key battleground states as we barrel into November a new Quinnipiac University [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=52.64s)]
*  Poll has Donald Trump leading vice president Harris by four points among likely voters in Georgia [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  49% to 45% but in North Carolina [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=67.2s)]
*  Harris leads Trump by three [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=71.12s)]
*  49% to 46% hard to square those two [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  I guess the answer is things are close and we should note both polls are within the margin of error [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=76.56s)]
*  Meanwhile Republican officials are reportedly sounding the alarm to the Trump campaign over its voter turnout operation in battleground states [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=81.96s)]
*  Court is reporting in the Guardian the Republican ticket has invested far fewer resources in its ground game [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Than in previous cycles the officials say the operations resemble a midterm cycle not a presidential election [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  They also say that attempts by the Trump campaign to fill the gap through money from political action committees [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=103.52s)]
*  Have come too late [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=110.32s)]
*  The Republican National Committee once hoped for a massive ground game team in 2024 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=112.16s)]
*  However, once Trump loyalists took over the committee [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=118.24s)]
*  They redirected that funding to combating alleged voter fraud and joining us now is national political correspondent for politico [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=121.16s)]
*  Meredith McGrath Meredith, let's start actually right there with the ground game piece of this because tonight's gonna matter [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=129.76s)]
*  We'll get to that in a second [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=135.32s)]
*  But so much the blocking and tackling of politics of campaigning is about the ground games and it does seem like [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=136.52s)]
*  Democrats have a significant advantage over Republicans [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=142.0s)]
*  Well, this is something that I keep hearing again and again from Republican strategists on the ground in some of these battleground states [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=145.4s)]
*  The Trump campaign has outsourced a lot of their ground game operation to outside conservative groups [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=152.32s)]
*  Who are doing the things like door knocking or? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=159.16s)]
*  voter data [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=162.96s)]
*  Gathering or making the phone banking phone calls that that are so essential to driving turnout on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=164.88s)]
*  Election day or even just gauging where different voters on the ground are and a lot of that has been outsourced [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=171.48s)]
*  And that's caused a lot of angst among some Republicans on the ground who don't feel like the Trump campaign is doing enough at the moment [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=177.0s)]
*  to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  edge out [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  Democrats organization [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=188.4s)]
*  So we played a clip from Nikki Haley and I think her efforts to get Trump advanced a tone down their rhetoric will [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=190.28s)]
*  Fall on deaf ears, but she's on to something about Trump's problem with women polls show that he's down there [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=196.0s)]
*  And of course tonight he squares off against a woman and Vice President Harris [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=201.16s)]
*  Talk to us how the Trump campaign is is trying to close this gender gap [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=206.04s)]
*  Well, look Donald Trump has been behind [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=210.4s)]
*  Harris by double digits with women and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=213.76s)]
*  He really hasn't been able to close that gap at all and his performance tonight at the debate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=216.72s)]
*  Could be really important in all of that because of course like you said he is squaring off against a woman again [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=222.6s)]
*  And when I asked Trump's campaign about this yesterday, you know, they said that Trump respects women [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=229.08s)]
*  He's not going to change his tone and he's really going to be focused on policy [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=235.9s)]
*  And that's what Trump's advisors are hoping is that he keeps the focus on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=240.3s)]
*  Harris's record as a prosecutor and as an attorney general in California and as of course her record too as vice president [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=245.26s)]
*  in the the Biden administration, but there have been concerns that I've heard from [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=253.86s)]
*  outside allies that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=259.94s)]
*  Trump's tone could really hurt him with college educated women who he continues to struggle with and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=261.98s)]
*  We've seen how Trump has tried to moderate his message for women [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=268.46s)]
*  he's said his administration would be great for quote reproductive rights and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=272.06s)]
*  You know, he's bragged about how some women really love him [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=277.29999999999995s)]
*  but the polling just doesn't bear that out and Trump's advisors brought in former congressman Tulsi Gabbard who [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=281.78s)]
*  Debated against Kamala Harris to help him [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=289.5s)]
*  Recalibrate ahead of this debate and she landed some pretty [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=293.9s)]
*  She she landed some attack lines when she debated Harris herself that were seen as pretty effective [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  But of course the factor too that she's a woman and Trump's going to have to keep that in mind tonight [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=305.82s)]
*  Yeah back in the 2019 Democratic primaries there. So you mentioned that Trump's advisors are hoping to focus on policy [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  I think we all could be a little skeptical that Trump himself was able to do that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  He was relatively subdued in his debate against President Biden though told countless lies that of course was overshadowed by [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  Biden's faltering performance [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=328.34s)]
*  What's the worry level among Trump allies and aides that he's gonna be able to simply keep his composure tonight? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=330.38s)]
*  Particularly if Harris a former prosecutor really goes at him [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=336.58s)]
*  Well, I think they feel a sigh of relief with the debate rules themselves the fact that these microphones are going to be muted [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  That's going to prevent him from talking over Harris [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=349.62s)]
*  You know if you think back to when Harris debated Vice President Mike Pence [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=353.86s)]
*  One of those memorable moments was when she turned to him and said I'm speaking [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  Because he was interrupting her and so I don't think we're gonna see something like that on stage [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  But for Trump's advisors really sticking to her record is going to be essential to them feeling good about tonight [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=368.06s)]
*  National political correspondent for politico Meredith McGraw. Thank you so much [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=376.22s)]
*  Of course we're reading your latest reporting online and it cannot be overstated tonight a significant [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=380.1s)]
*  Moment in this campaign what we weren't sure was gonna happen [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=387.02s)]
*  One that of course comes on the heels of a consequential debate a debate that changed the Democratic ticket now [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  Vice President Harris versus former President Trump. We of course will have complete coverage all day long on MSNBC [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=396.06s)]
*  You [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LwoGKHBb3M&t=410.06s)]
