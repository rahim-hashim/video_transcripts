# Trump to be sentenced in New York hush money criminal trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA)
*  President-elect Trump is scheduled to be sentenced in his hush money criminal case later this morning in New York City [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes after the Supreme Court rejected his request to stop the proceeding in a decision released late last night [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=5.48s)]
*  Let's bring in MSNBC justice and legal affairs analyst Anthony Coley [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=11.68s)]
*  He was the top spokesperson at the Department of Justice under Attorney General Merrick Garland [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=15.56s)]
*  Anthony first just your reaction to what the Supreme Court decided and the fact that it was the three liberals joined by Amy Coney Barrett [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And the Chief Justice. What are you reading into it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=27.2s)]
*  Well, I tell you I think this is a rare moment of independence from the Supreme Court [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=29.5s)]
*  And it was the right thing to do based on the facts and the law and the facts here are pretty straightforward [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=33.96s)]
*  right you have Donald Trump who in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=39.26s)]
*  2016 as a private citizen tried to corruptly influence the outcome of that presidential election by [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=41.82s)]
*  Keeping quiet or at having stormy quiet Daniels keep quiet about her [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=49.06s)]
*  Relationship with Donald Trump and they lying about it in his business records [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=53.42s)]
*  Like that's what this is about personal conduct that began as a private citizen [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=57.74s)]
*  And so that's one part of it in terms of a law. That's pretty straightforward, too [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=63.34s)]
*  I mean, this is a one-page order here [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=69.2s)]
*  And the operative phrase here is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  The court says that Trump's issues can be addressed quote in the normal course and what this really says here [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=78.5s)]
*  Is that Donald Trump you jump the gun you have not exhausted your rights or appellate rights at the state level [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=84.58000000000001s)]
*  And so this is not right for us to review that also means that this case could very well make its way back to the Supreme Court [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  Again, and I really believe here that Donald Trump. He's previewed what his arguments will be [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=99.14s)]
*  Yeah, right that in the Supreme Court's ruling this this summer. They found that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  Official acts he has brought immunity from them and the testimony in some of this state-level case [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=111.78s)]
*  Included testimony from White House officials. Yep, it included [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=118.58s)]
*  Him signing checks in the Oval Office. And so his argument is going to be that it included information [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=123.1s)]
*  That they should not have included [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=129.46s)]
*  Bottom line here for people just tuning in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=132.02s)]
*  Alley is that as of the end of the hearing this morning [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=134.42s)]
*  Donald Trump will be the first American president to be a convicted felon at the end of this year [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  It's a stunning moment in history one that we knew we were going towards [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=144.14s)]
*  But then he also says it all comes down to the appeal. He said last night [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=148.22s)]
*  I understand what the court's decision was but we're going to make an appeal here [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=151.6s)]
*  So what does that process look like and are those arguments gonna be central to it? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah, they absolutely are gonna be central to it. I suspect what he's gonna do is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  First [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=163.38s)]
*  Appeal the this entire effort to the entire appellate division within the New York State system [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=165.02s)]
*  Even that's gonna take several several months [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=172.46s)]
*  So I think that's what's gonna happen now, but ultimately I want to say one additional thing here. You mentioned the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=175.46s)]
*  The two swing votes so the state Chief Justice Roberts and Amy Comey Barrett a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=181.9s)]
*  Trump appointee was so interesting about this duo is they read the same opinion polls as you and I do [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=188.3s)]
*  and so I really think what they try to do here is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=195.58s)]
*  Restore faith and the US Supreme Court [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=201.34s)]
*  And I mean, it's a pretty fair reading of the law [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  But you know, we'll see it's gonna take a little while for this to get back up to the Supreme Court again [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=208.94s)]
*  So then what do you expect to see at 930? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=214.22s)]
*  Is this gonna be a short process cut and dry or are we in for? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=216.66s)]
*  Right, so we know that Donald Trump is going to appear virtually right judge. Juan Marchand has giving him that option [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=220.5s)]
*  We also know that at the end of this process [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=228.26s)]
*  Judge Juan Marchand is going to publicly release audio of this sentencing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=231.82s)]
*  so I suspect what we're gonna see later this morning is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=236.98s)]
*  Some stern words from Judge Juan Marchand about how Donald Trump has [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=241.42s)]
*  Tried to undermine the jury system at every step. You'll remember that he [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  Was held in criminal contempt of court 10 times for violating this narrowly tailored gag orders [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=253.5s)]
*  So that's why I expect we're gonna see when this all gets underway later this morning [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  And then there's another piece to this too [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  There's of course the legal drama that is continuously playing out in New York [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=266.08s)]
*  And then there's what's happening here in DC because a federal appeals court ruled yesterday that the DOJ can release [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=269.1s)]
*  Jacksmith's report regarding Trump's alleged role in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=275.42s)]
*  Overturning the 2020 election results January 6th [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=279.26000000000005s)]
*  They will not be at this point releasing his report around the classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=282.06s)]
*  But what does that tell you that we're we're gonna ultimately end up seeing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=288.74s)]
*  What one piece of Jack Smith's work is right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=293.42s)]
*  Listen, this is another frivolous effort by Donald Trump, but I also have [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=295.5s)]
*  You know, I worked at the Justice Department [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=300.22s)]
*  So I also think that this is a problem of this Justice Department's own making and what do I mean by that? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=301.74s)]
*  They did not have to preview this report [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=307.94s)]
*  With opposing counsel they did it because it's an institutional norm [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=312.22s)]
*  But what we have seen from conservatives and Republicans in recent months is that they don't care about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=316.38s)]
*  Institutional norms so much and so Democrats have got to learn how to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  Play by the rules. Yes, but also how to play hardball. So this report will eventually [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=329.90000000000003s)]
*  See the light of day. There's no legal justification to keep it on the wraps [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=336.22s)]
*  And that's the last thing that Donald Trump wants and I know I'm not sure how much time we have but I will say second [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=341.34000000000003s)]
*  I will say this quickly [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  Jack Smith and his predecessors typically testify before Congress at the end of these reports [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=348.82s)]
*  I don't know that congressional Republicans will won't Jack Smith [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=354.26s)]
*  Venture a guess no, right will not be an invitation, right? But that's actually a fair point that you make there Anthony Coley [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for joining us [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=366.38s)]
*  You [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_w5jxoFHSA&t=378.58s)]
