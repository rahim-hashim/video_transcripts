# Trumpworld sees Haley surging toward DeSantis
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s)
*  Aquiturnist in politics now and a Donald Trump pollster is reportedly telling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican donors that former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=4.96s)]
*  surged in Iowa following the first GOP primary debate. The polling memo which [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  was obtained by Axios also noted that Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy are [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  associated with Florida governor Ron DeSantis in New Hampshire. According to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=20.16s)]
*  Axios the memo reflects that Trump's team's emphasis on DeSantis's early [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=24.64s)]
*  struggles and how the campaign is trying to shift the primary narrative from [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=29.16s)]
*  Trump versus DeSantis to Trump versus everyone else. Joining us now the co- [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  founder of Axios Mike Allen. Mike great to see you this morning. So let's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=39.24s)]
*  let's talk a little bit about the memo and the reasons behind it. I think we can [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=44.72s)]
*  agree that some of this motivation is Trump team trying to put DeSantis in this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=48.56s)]
*  place but I think Nikki Haley did impress a lot of people that night. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Republicans you're speaking to why do they think she is what about what she [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=57.08s)]
*  did has caused the search? Yeah Jonathan I think that's a very smart point that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=61.96s)]
*  there is a lot of Nikki Haley reality that's behind this memo. I'm hearing it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=66.48s)]
*  from both coasts and both parties. What's behind it is she had an answer on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=72.36s)]
*  abortion. The lot of Republicans said that's an practical answer that is [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=78.44s)]
*  better than what the party's been saying a lot of times on that and so [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=84.76s)]
*  I'm hearing that there's a lot of Republican donors who are offering to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=90.4s)]
*  hold events for her and when you're in a candidate in a crowded field this far [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=94.72s)]
*  out there's no call you'd rather get than someone from a donor someone with [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=99.84s)]
*  a lot of money and or a lot of friends and funnily enough a lot of people with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=105.34s)]
*  a lot of money have a lot of friends who want to do an event from you and then [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=110.12s)]
*  Jonathan from the other party from Democrats I'm hearing I know you're [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=114.16s)]
*  hearing the same thing too that that they say if somehow Nikki Haley the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=118.78s)]
*  former South Carolina governor former ambassador the UN if she could get past [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=124.2s)]
*  Trump if she somehow became the Democratic the Republican nominee and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=130.04s)]
*  there's no numerical way to see how that happens now but if that happens that she [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=135.16s)]
*  could be a very strong opponent for Biden so there's Democrats who say I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=140.76s)]
*  would not want President Biden to have to face ambassador Haley in a general [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=146.48s)]
*  again buzz conversation that you'd love to hear when you're trying to break out [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  the fact that these Trump aides is Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio saying she's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=157.04s)]
*  rising in Iowa New Hampshire reflects push kick the Florida governor a little [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=162.84s)]
*  bit and here's the reality they're seeing on the ground also about Nikki [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=169.56s)]
*  Haley yeah and I think it's it's a good point that Haley profiles as someone who [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  would be a good general election candidate but let's be real as you just [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=177.84s)]
*  noted Haley is still 40 plus points behind Donald Trump they all are so [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=181.62s)]
*  let's talk about that right now I mean we saw poll numbers move a little bit [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=187.28s)]
*  after that first debate and and Trump in some states even lost a couple of points [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=191.12s)]
*  but he's still so far ahead what's the Trump team's thinking right now is that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=196.16s)]
*  gonna change their strategy at all about how they approach the next handful of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=199.92s)]
*  weeks including the next couple of debates as you know the Trump team has [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=204.44s)]
*  been aggressive from day zero they long before some of these candidates were any [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=208.48s)]
*  numerical threat before they were showing up on bowls you saw the Trump [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=215.6s)]
*  team hitting them all of these candidates Jonathan they're running to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=219.72s)]
*  be the person standing if for whatever reason Donald Trump is hit by lightning [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=225.88s)]
*  something we've talked about it for months still true something dramatic [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=230.28s)]
*  would have to happen to change for Donald Trump to not be the nominee but [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=234.4s)]
*  what has been true about every single year you and I have been covering is [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=239.24s)]
*  something dramatic happening and that's what you're counting on if you're the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  Florida governor if you're Nikki Haley if you're Senator Tim Scott of South [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=246.44s)]
*  Carolina you just want to be there ready be strong have money have an [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=250.44s)]
*  organization if there's suddenly an opening yeah and certainly there are [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=255.12s)]
*  some big events on the horizon including a number of court dates for Trump but [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=259.04s)]
*  he's maintaining aggressive campaign schedule has just noted a rally in South [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=262.88s)]
*  Dakota coming up and I'll note the governor of South Dakota someone who [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=267.0s)]
*  would I think be on his vice presidential shortlist but let's talk [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=270.32s)]
*  about one of the other candidates that you just mentioned because Axios has got [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=273.68s)]
*  some exclusive reporting about GOP donors expressing concerns about one [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  candidate Tim Scott's personal life and how that may impact his electoral [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=282.76000000000005s)]
*  chances tell us yeah Jonathan this is fascinating behind the scenes Republican [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=287.44s)]
*  conversation about Senator Tim Scott Republican of South Carolina who's one [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  of those strong candidates vying to be a Trump alternative Axios Alex Tom [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=297.92s)]
*  picking up exclusively on the fact that donors are very concerned about the fact [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=303.52s)]
*  that Senator Scott is 57 and single they're saying is there something we [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=308.32s)]
*  should know the fact that he is a bachelor and America hasn't had a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=313.4s)]
*  bachelor president in more than a century they're concerned that if they [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  go all in on him then in a very conservative party that could suddenly be [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=322.91999999999996s)]
*  an issue interestingly enough something that Alex picked up on and is very [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=328.4s)]
*  extensive conversations with top Republican officials is that because the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=333.0s)]
*  answers so far about this from Senator Scott and from the campaign have been [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=337.76s)]
*  vague what has that done it's been just like in rate in real life it's made [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=343.52s)]
*  everyone just more curious about it Axios is able to report this morning [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=348.2s)]
*  the Scott got campaign now saying that Senator Scott will address this issue in [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=352.96s)]
*  the next couple weeks. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  I will certainly look for that it's also Scott another one who should who is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  considered on a potential Trump and VP shortlist it's notable that he has not [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=362.72s)]
*  trained any fire on the Republican front runner perhaps to that effect and of [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=366.68s)]
*  course one other we should mention of course Governor DeSantis of Florida [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  stepped away from the campaign trail for a few days to focus on his state's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=374.44000000000005s)]
*  recovery from the storm and at least for the time being disaster relief is one [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=378.6s)]
*  place where at least temporarily partisan politics set aside so that's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=382.12s)]
*  good to see co-founder of Axios Mike Allen thank you for being with us this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  morning and thanks to all of you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziAC0bNtz7s&t=389.72s)]
