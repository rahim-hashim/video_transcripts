# Active search and rescue effort after plane and Army helicopter collide near D.C.
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4)
*  Good morning and welcome to our live coverage as we come on the air with breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=0.0s)]
*  Overnight an American Airlines passenger flight crashed midair with an Army helicopter here [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=6.16s)]
*  in the Washington D.C. area. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=10.8s)]
*  Video captured by Earthcam shows the moment of collision over the Potomac River. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=13.14s)]
*  It happened just before 9 p.m. Eastern near Reagan National Airport, just minutes from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=17.68s)]
*  where we are here in the studio. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  The plane departed from Wichita, Kansas with 60 passengers and four crew members on board. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=24.16s)]
*  People say the Black Hawk helicopter was coming from Fort Belvoir and had three people on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=29.56s)]
*  board for that. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=33.76s)]
*  An Army official tells NBC News it's believed they were on a training flight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Search and rescue operations are now underway and this is a live look from outside of Reagan [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=39.32s)]
*  National Airport where first responders are dealing with difficult conditions between [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=43.68s)]
*  the wind, the dark and the cold. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=48.12s)]
*  As of now no survivors have been found. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=51.32s)]
*  NBC Washington reports at least 12 bodies have been recovered. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=53.32s)]
*  They're citing two sources familiar with the search efforts. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=57.2s)]
*  Overnight U.S. Figure skating confirmed several of its members were on board this American [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Airlines flight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=64.44s)]
*  The organization says athletes, coaches and family members were returning home from the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  National Development Camp that was held in conjunction with the skating championships [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=71.04s)]
*  in Wichita. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Reagan National Airport is expected to be closed until at least 11 a.m. this morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  Takeoffs and landings were halted around 9 p.m. shortly after the crash. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=81.68s)]
*  Joining us now from Alexandria, Virginia along the Potomac River is our NBC News correspondent [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=87.48s)]
*  Aaron Gilchrist. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=91.56s)]
*  Aaron, what's the latest that you're seeing on the ground? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=92.56s)]
*  I can see the lights and sirens behind you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Ali, there is still an active search and rescue effort happening here along the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=98.28s)]
*  Potomac River. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=103.48s)]
*  We are just south of Reagan National Airport where there is no access. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=104.48s)]
*  As I drove along the GW Park, the George Washington Parkway here this morning, you could see all [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=108.76s)]
*  the points where you could access the airport are blocked by law enforcement officers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=113.44s)]
*  And this is still, according to officials in this area, this is a joint operation that's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=118.2s)]
*  being led by DC Fire and an EMS along with DC Police. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=122.88s)]
*  And then several agencies from Virginia and from Maryland have engaged as well to help [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=127.72s)]
*  to execute this search effort along with federal partners and state partners, we should say, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=133.28s)]
*  too. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=138.6s)]
*  At this point, as you noted, we know that there is a report from sources familiar that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=139.76s)]
*  12 bodies have been recovered of the 67 that were on the aircraft that went into the water [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=144.84s)]
*  around nine o'clock last night. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=151.0s)]
*  That's from two sources familiar, according to our NBC4 affiliate here in Washington. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=152.56s)]
*  You may still be able to hear the helicopter. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=157.72s)]
*  There's at least one that's flying overhead here with a bright spotlight on the water. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=159.76s)]
*  As we understand, there have been about 300 rescuers, first responders that have been [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=164.04s)]
*  participating in this effort since about nine o'clock last night, still trying to find people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  who went into the water when that Black Hawk helicopter collided with this 60 passenger [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=175.04s)]
*  60 seat passenger jet right here in the Potomac River late last night. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=181.68s)]
*  And so as we understand it, there will be another briefing around seven thirty this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=187.0s)]
*  morning. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=190.72s)]
*  We expect to potentially learn more. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=191.72s)]
*  The question was put to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser last night about how many people survived, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=194.64s)]
*  how many people had perished. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't a question that the mayor was willing to answer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=201.88s)]
*  She clearly did not want to answer that question directly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=204.4s)]
*  And so, Ali, that's something we're hoping to get some clarity on this morning. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=207.16s)]
*  It's hard to believe, as you noted, with the cold water conditions, the amount of time [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=210.92s)]
*  that these aircraft and those people have been in the water, it's hard to imagine that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=215.4s)]
*  there could be many survivors. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  But there is still hope. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=221.0s)]
*  There is still technically a search and rescue, not recovery, search and rescue effort that's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=222.72s)]
*  going on here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=227.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=228.12s)]
*  And just to orient our viewers as to where Reagan National is, you know this area so [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=229.12s)]
*  well, having been a local reporter here, Aaron, before joining us at NBC News here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=234.48s)]
*  But this is an airport that is just across the river from where we are in D.C. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=240.04s)]
*  When you talk about Reagan National, this is an airport that you, I, all of us fly into [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=245.96s)]
*  all the time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=250.4s)]
*  Technically in Virginia, but this, where the plane was landing, the fact that they landed [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=252.48s)]
*  in the Potomac after this crash, that's the water approach that we all make when we fly [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=258.24s)]
*  into Reagan. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=263.84s)]
*  This is within view of the Capitol. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=264.84s)]
*  You can see the Washington Monument. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=266.96s)]
*  It's very, very close to Washington, D.C. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=269.68s)]
*  This is not some far-off airport. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=272.6s)]
*  The fact that I, when I was coming into work this morning, could hear some of those helicopters [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=274.76s)]
*  that I now hear in the background of your live shot, again for viewers, just gives you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=278.88s)]
*  the proximity of what we're talking about here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=283.04s)]
*  What else are you seeing, Aaron? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  I know that we were talking about how the cold and the dark are a condition making it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=287.8s)]
*  so much more difficult for first responders who are fanned out, trying to rescue anyone [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  that might be in the water. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=297.2s)]
*  But ice is also a really big condition that they're battling in the water. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=298.88s)]
*  Talk about, I know it's between five and eight feet of water there in the Potomac, but just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=303.36s)]
*  talk about what else you're seeing by way of the rescue operation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=307.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's hard to see anything because it's so dark. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=310.44s)]
*  And obviously we have lights here so we can illuminate where we are. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  And there's, as we noted, a helicopter that's flying overhead with a bright spotlight as [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=317.52s)]
*  well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=321.88s)]
*  The boats that are in the water have lights. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=322.88s)]
*  But it's still incredibly dark out here. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=324.82s)]
*  Pitch black if you didn't have that extra illumination. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=326.55999999999995s)]
*  That makes things more difficult for the divers who are going into the water. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=329.11999999999995s)]
*  The Potomac River isn't known as a sort of a clear water body here. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=334.0s)]
*  And so it's difficult to see into that water as well. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=338.16s)]
*  You noted the fact that there's been ice on the river. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=341.48s)]
*  You'll remember, was it just last week when the presidential inaugural events were moved [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=344.36s)]
*  indoors because it was so cold. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=348.92s)]
*  It has warmed up a bit over the last couple of days. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=351.4s)]
*  And so the ice has not been as thick and vicious as it had been, but still a complication for [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=353.6s)]
*  the divers that are having to go into the water or have been going into the water for [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=359.56s)]
*  the last several hours. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  As you noted, you can't help but to note that this airport sits on the river. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=365.8s)]
*  And because you can't fly, for the most part, you can't fly over the District of Columbia [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=371.12s)]
*  because of restricted airspace there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=374.8s)]
*  Most aircraft that are coming into Reagan National approach from the south or they approach [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=377.56s)]
*  from the north. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=381.76s)]
*  There are just a couple of runways at Reagan National. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=382.76s)]
*  And this American Airlines small passenger plane was coming on, we believe coming from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=385.26s)]
*  the south up the Potomac River to land on the runway that sort of runs not necessarily [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  perpendicular to the other runways, but it crosses one of the longer runways here. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=397.92s)]
*  And the directly across the river, you have Joint Base Anacostia Bowling. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=402.24s)]
*  It's an air air force facility where aircraft can take off from. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=408.24s)]
*  But there are so many others. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=412.72s)]
*  There's a Coast Guard station right up the river from where we are. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  Fort Belvoir, we know, is south of here. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=416.68s)]
*  And that's where that Black Hawk helicopter came from. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=419.0s)]
*  We are this airport is just a stone's throw from the Pentagon. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=422.12s)]
*  And so there's a lot of activity, military aircraft activity that happens in this region, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=425.28s)]
*  along with all the commercial planes that come in and out of Reagan National Alley. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=430.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=433.92s)]
*  And definitely one of the most controlled air spaces in the country, given the fact [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=434.92s)]
*  that this is our nation's capital. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=438.48s)]
*  NBC's Aaron Gilchrist, thank you for joining us. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=440.36s)]
*  We're going to come back with you later this hour. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmiT3EXxYw4&t=442.32s)]
