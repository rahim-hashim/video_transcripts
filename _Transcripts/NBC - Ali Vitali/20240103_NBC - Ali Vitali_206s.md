# Bipartisan Senate group meets on border security
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU)
*  The bipartisan group of senators trying to negotiate a border security deal returned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=0.0s)]
*  here to Washington yesterday to continue talks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  The group, led by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, Republican James Lankford, and independent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=8.68s)]
*  Kirsten Sinema, met yesterday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=13.92s)]
*  nearly two hours. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=18.84s)]
*  They're trying to find some common ground on border security in exchange for funding [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=20.92s)]
*  for Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=25.44s)]
*  Senator Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said the group plans to update the full Senate [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=28.68s)]
*  when the body returns on Monday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=32.84s)]
*  So we've continued to talk through the break. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=36.48s)]
*  We're going to continue working this week. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=40.32s)]
*  We are still at the table. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=42.76s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=47.72s)]
*  It's very hard. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=48.72s)]
*  And we're going to do our best to try to come to a conclusion. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=49.72s)]
*  Last night, President Biden spoke to reporters when he returned to the White House after [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=56.72s)]
*  his vacation, saying Congress should get him the money he needs for the border so he can [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=60.96s)]
*  act. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=66.4s)]
*  Are you going to do anything about this southern border, Mr. President? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=67.4s)]
*  The southern border. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=68.4s)]
*  Are you going to do anything about it, the regular number of migrants? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=69.4s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for Bloomberg, Akaila Gargar. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=70.4s)]
*  Akaila, good to see you again. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=91.0s)]
*  So we heard a little bit from the president there urging action, as he has done before. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=92.4s)]
*  What's the latest you've heard from White House officials? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  About the negotiations over border security. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=100.32s)]
*  How optimistic are they that a deal can get done? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  And what is the president hoping will happen? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=106.27999999999999s)]
*  I think what we've seen from the White House and also from Congress is they've expressed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=110.08s)]
*  encouragement. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=114.08s)]
*  They feel as though that they're making progress. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=115.08s)]
*  But I think behind closed doors, the reality is a lot different. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  These two sides are very far apart. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=120.8s)]
*  We know that the Senate right now is leading these negotiations. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson heading to the U.S.-Mexico border with a group of 60 Republicans basically [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=127.92s)]
*  showing how defiant and how much they really want to see stricter immigration policy. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=134.32s)]
*  And really at the heart of this issue is restrictions on asylum seekers, people who are coming to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=140.68s)]
*  the U.S. with legitimate concerns. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=146.64s)]
*  And Republicans right now feel like those people have too much leeway to stay in the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=149.8s)]
*  country for far too long. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=154.16s)]
*  They feel as though hearing times are too long. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=155.52s)]
*  And yet Democrats really want to protect people who they feel need that protection, who have [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=158.24s)]
*  legitimate concerns. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  And as you heard from President Biden, at the end of the day, he feels as though he [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=164.72s)]
*  needs this money to address a system that's very overwhelmed. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=167.56s)]
*  We've seen an unprecedented level of migration. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=171.08s)]
*  And at the end of the day, this is also tied to Ukraine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=174.44s)]
*  And he has made a commitment to Zelensky and the G7 that he is going to continue to deliver [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  aid. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=181.68s)]
*  And now he cannot do that, as long as these two sides can't agree. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1V6vE4giyU&t=182.68s)]
