# Biden set to join UAW picket line in Michigan
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw)
*  Meanwhile, the top Democrat, President Joe Biden, he'll join striking autoworkers on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=0.0s)]
*  the picket lines today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=4.92s)]
*  The president will meet with union members in Wayne County, Michigan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=6.84s)]
*  Sources are telling NBC News that UAW President Sean Fein is also expected to be there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=10.4s)]
*  He had invited Biden to join the picket line. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=16.9s)]
*  Tens of thousands of United autoworkers walked off their jobs nearly two weeks ago after [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=19.16s)]
*  their contracts with General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis expired. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=24.1s)]
*  They're demanding higher wages and better benefits, which President Biden says he supports. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=28.3s)]
*  I think the UAW gave up an incredible amount back when the automobile industry was going [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=35.22s)]
*  under. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  They gave everything from their pensions on and they saved the automobile industry. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  And I think that now that the industry is roaring back, they should participate in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=48.42s)]
*  benefit of that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=55.900000000000006s)]
*  And if you take a look at the significant increase in salaries for executives and growth [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=56.9s)]
*  in the industry, they should benefit from it. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=63.1s)]
*  So yes, I support, I always support the recovery. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=65.94s)]
*  According to the White House, this is the first time a sitting president has visited [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=69.78s)]
*  a picket line in modern times. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=73.74s)]
*  But it's not the first time for Biden. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=76.78s)]
*  Back in 2019, when he was running for president, Biden joined several strikers, including a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=79.12s)]
*  UAW picket line in Kansas City. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=85.3s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for the Associated Press, Darlene Superville. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  Darlene, great to see you as always. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=92.5s)]
*  We'll turn to the UAW in a moment, but let's start with that brand new NBC News poll. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=94.46s)]
*  Some pretty surprising numbers to be candid and worrisome ones for Democrats and in particular [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=99.02s)]
*  the Biden campaign on issues of defending democracy, which just seems hard to fathom, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=105.06s)]
*  but also on ones that voters may be thinking about as they head into the ballot box. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=110.6s)]
*  Issues like the economy, crime, immigration and border security. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=119.6s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=121.72s)]
*  Well, those are all issues that President Biden has been struggling on since he took [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=122.72s)]
*  office. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=128.32s)]
*  Certainly the economy, immigration. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=129.32s)]
*  I think what one of the things you see with the immigration number is a carryover from [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=131.84s)]
*  he was very pro-sealing the border, blocking immigrants, and he was just viewed stronger [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=137.48s)]
*  on that issue by the public than Democrats are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  And so some of that would seem to me to be just a bit of a carryover from that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=148.5s)]
*  So Darlene, let's talk about the president's trip later today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=156.28s)]
*  We just heard him there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  He's always been pro-labor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  He identifies himself as being very friendly with the unions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=163.28s)]
*  He's had experience on picket lines before. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=167.68s)]
*  But it also seems to me this feels like a bit of a general election play, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=170.68s)]
*  Almost an unofficial start to this campaign because the president's going there today. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=174.24s)]
*  We know who Donald Trump is going there tomorrow. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=178.24s)]
*  Trump's skipping the Republican debate, trying to win some support of rank-and-file union [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=180.48s)]
*  members, even if not perhaps the leadership. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=185.8s)]
*  And Michigan is one of the most important states on the battlefield. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=188.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=192.0s)]
*  Michigan is one of the handful of states that will help decide the 2024 presidential election next year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=193.72s)]
*  And so overlaying the visit by both President Biden and former President Trump is 2024 presidential [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=199.8s)]
*  politics and both men kind of using the visit to try to appeal or tap into some of the angst [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=206.92s)]
*  amongst working-class people about the economy and their jobs and so forth. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=215.48s)]
*  The UAW and former President Trump have been concerned about President Biden's push for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  automakers to move toward electric vehicles. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=230.24s)]
*  And that's one thing that we'll see former President Trump trying to exploit perhaps [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  tomorrow when he visits. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=238.8s)]
*  And then you have the president who has said that he's the most pro-union president ever [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=241.12s)]
*  in the history of the United States of America, going there to walk a picket line to kind [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  of demonstrate that in fact he is behind the UAW workers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly the White House trying to create some important images here for the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=257.16s)]
*  president. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=261.32s)]
*  And again, as you say, Darlene, trying to stand with a union movement. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=262.32s)]
*  White House reporter for the Associated Press, Darlene Superville, thank you so much for [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  joining us this morning and getting us started. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoSowrlVGrw&t=268.6s)]
