# Biden signs funding bill, avoiding government shutdown
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0)
*  We begin with some good news. The federal government will stay open, at least through the end of the year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's because late last night, President Joe Biden signed the stopgap funding bill that was passed by the House and Senate a few days earlier. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=6.88s)]
*  The move avoids a government shutdown that would have taken effect tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=15.92s)]
*  The continuing resolution, or as it's known, the CR, extends funding for several federal agencies until January 19th. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=20.48s)]
*  That includes the Departments of Agriculture, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, as well as, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=29.68s)]
*  Veteran Affairs. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=36.24s)]
*  The CR then funds the remaining parts of the government, including the Defense Department, until February 2nd. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  But, that means lawmakers will face another funding fight to keep the government open early in the new year, an election year, at that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU3PUO4Msf0&t=43.96s)]
