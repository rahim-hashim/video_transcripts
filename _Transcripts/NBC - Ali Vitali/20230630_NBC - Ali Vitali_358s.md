# Pence pledges unwavering support to Ukraine in face of Russian invasion
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc)
*  Republican presidential candidate Mike Pence is the first from the field of potential Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=0.0s)]
*  challengers to visit the war-torn country of Ukraine during this campaign season, and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky in person. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=9.52s)]
*  It comes as Pence looks to differentiate himself from other Republican candidates, including [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=12.76s)]
*  Don Wooden, who wouldn't say who he thinks should prevail in Russia's war, as well as [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=17.6s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, who called the war a territorial dispute before sort of walking that back. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=22.64s)]
*  Earlier in the day, Pence visited a community on the outskirts of Kiev and spoke with local [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=27.76s)]
*  families. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=31.92s)]
*  He reassured them of the United States' support. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=32.92s)]
*  He capped the day with brief remarks to reporters where he spoke about his visit and his meeting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=36.0s)]
*  with President Zelensky. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=40.56s)]
*  As I learned, President Zelensky and his security team, the Ukrainian military is making steady [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=43.52s)]
*  advances against the Russians. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=50.84s)]
*  And I assured him that for my part, we'll continue to do everything in our power to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=53.44s)]
*  make sure that we provide the Ukrainian military with the support they need until they repel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=59.36s)]
*  the Russian invasion and restore the sovereignty of this country. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  And joining us now, correspondent for Bloomberg TV, Anne Marie Horton. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=71.24s)]
*  Anne Marie, great to see you again. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=75.28s)]
*  So the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, just about two weeks off. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=76.92s)]
*  Obviously, the war in Ukraine, first and foremost, the center of attention. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=81.44s)]
*  But there is some tension in terms of what Ukraine wants and what the West has been willing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=84.68s)]
*  to give them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  And especially now in this sort of pivotal moment where we've seen the chaos in Russia, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  but also pretty slow going from Ukraine's counteroffensive. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=95.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=98.12s)]
*  And this tension has been there the entire time and will continue to exist as long as [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=99.12s)]
*  this war exists. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=103.04s)]
*  Ukraine is always asking for more, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=105.2s)]
*  So they got the high mars, and now they're also asking for another long-range missile [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=106.56s)]
*  system. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=110.72s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that potentially this is under discussion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=111.72s)]
*  But we've seen the U.S. drag its feet with some of these weapons, especially when they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=114.44s)]
*  do not want a scenario where potentially you can hit inside Russia and escalate this conflict [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=118.2s)]
*  into something broader and more volatile. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=123.6s)]
*  What Ukraine wants at NATO is what they've continued to be asking for. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=126.12s)]
*  And Oksana Makarova, the Ukrainian ambassador, was on Bloomberg yesterday, and she talked [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=129.8s)]
*  about we want more weapons, we want more aid and support to Ukraine, and we want more sanctions [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=133.6s)]
*  on Russia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=137.96s)]
*  And at the same time, they're also still trying to get in not just NATO, but also the European [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  Union. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=143.88s)]
*  They want to be part of, quote unquote, the European family. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=144.88s)]
*  And Zelensky spoke this week, and a little bit of a dig. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  He said it is absurd that these leaders continue to look behind their shoulders, meaning looking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  to the Kremlin and are concerned. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=155.56s)]
*  So they are going to push it as much as they can, especially right now while we are seeing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=157.4s)]
*  some of this turmoil in Russia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  So let's get into that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, I know you've been covering it so closely. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=165.12s)]
*  What's your latest assessment of as to where things stand right now in terms of Putin's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=167.4s)]
*  grip on power, the changes you've seen in the Kremlin? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, look, what the Kremlin is trying to do is very much have a this-is-business-as-usual [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=172.72s)]
*  approach. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=176.52s)]
*  This is mundane. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=177.52s)]
*  Putin is going through his normal procedures. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=178.52s)]
*  There are some interesting nuance to look at. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=180.56s)]
*  One is that they are starting to beef up the Russian National Guard. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=183.36s)]
*  This is led by Putin's former personal security guard, and they're giving him tanks and weapons [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  he had been asking for. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=191.88s)]
*  So you can look for some of these nuances. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=193.56s)]
*  We also have not seen from Sergey Sorovokin. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=195.84s)]
*  This is a general that is being questioned on whether or not he had this help to Yevgeny [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=198.48s)]
*  Prokhorov, who led this mutiny over the weekend, a halted mutiny. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=204.16s)]
*  He's an interesting player because he has been part of the Russian military apparatus [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=208.84s)]
*  for years, and he's known as General Armageddon for how brutal he was in Syria. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=212.44s)]
*  So there's a lot of things to really be watching for. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=219.62s)]
*  I would actually look at what happens to Wagner now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=222.04s)]
*  Putin had talked about that it's the Russian budget that Wagner gets their money from. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=225.16s)]
*  We've all known this for years, but Putin was very direct about it this week. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=229.4s)]
*  And even overnight, there were some drones at a military base that Wagner uses in Libya. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=232.88s)]
*  What happens to Wagner now and all of their work in Africa? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=238.16s)]
*  Are these generals, are they beholden to Brugogian, who's potentially going to try to keep this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  together from Belarus, or are they loyal to the president? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  We haven't heard from Brugogian in a couple of days. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=249.84s)]
*  Lastly, briefly, let's turn to China. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=252.12s)]
*  You've had some new reporting there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=253.84s)]
*  China, of course, has been somewhat supportive of the effort there in Russia, the U.S., and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=254.84s)]
*  relations with Beijing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=260.32s)]
*  It's been certainly very tense, maybe a step in the right direction with the secretary [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=261.32s)]
*  of state's visit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=264.56s)]
*  What's the latest you've heard? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=265.56s)]
*  Well, so we've reported, Jenny Leonard and I at Bloomberg, that Treasury Secretary Janet [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=266.56s)]
*  Yellen is set to go in early July. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=270.16s)]
*  So July is next week. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=272.0s)]
*  So at some point starting next week or beyond, we do expect Janet Yellen to be in Beijing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=273.0s)]
*  It's going to be an interesting time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=277.98s)]
*  I know you were talking about this earlier in the program regarding Nvidia. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=279.32s)]
*  It's going to be a hard line for her to walk. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=282.76s)]
*  At the same time, she's trying to have this dialogue. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  She said on MSNBC that we have to get to know each other. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=286.76s)]
*  This is a new vice Chinese premier that she's going to be meeting with, who really runs [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=289.32s)]
*  the economy out of Beijing, He Li-feng replacing Liu He, who she had a relationship with. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=293.08s)]
*  But at the same time, the U.S. is, one, looking at more export controls on semiconductors [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  that can help China's AI industry. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  And also, they're beefing up the work on outbound investment. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  That executive order we've been waiting for. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=308.8s)]
*  And potentially that can come as soon as July, the end of July. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=310.8s)]
*  So for the Treasury Secretary, it's going to be a difficult one. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and the White House, still hopeful of a meeting between President Biden and President [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=317.56s)]
*  Xi later this year, maybe at the G20 in India in September or in November at the Pacific [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=320.76000000000005s)]
*  States Summit in the United States. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=326.72s)]
*  Correspondent for Bloomberg TV, Anne Marie Horton. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=331.24s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=332.24s)]
*  And thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on this Friday morning. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxTKXl8-KNc&t=333.24s)]
