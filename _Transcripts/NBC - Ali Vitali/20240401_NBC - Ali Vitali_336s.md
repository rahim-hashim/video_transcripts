# Biden campaign releases ad appealing to Haley voters
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0)
*  The Biden campaign has released a new ad highlighting Donald Trump's attacks on Nikki Haley in an effort to attract her supporters. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=8.4s)]
*  Bird brain. I call it bird brain. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=10.92s)]
*  Nikki Haley has made an unholy alliance with rhinos, never Trumpers, Americans for no prosperity. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=14.88s)]
*  She's gone crazy. She's a very angry person. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  She is not presidential timber. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=25.68s)]
*  I don't need the votes. We have all the votes we need. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=28.0s)]
*  He is she's gone haywire. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=32.28s)]
*  There aren't that many never Trumpers anymore. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=33.64s)]
*  How do you bring these Nikki Haley voters back into the tent? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=35.4s)]
*  I'm not sure we need too many. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=37.52s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=41.24s)]
*  Ken has agreed to appear under the condition that I not bring up the New York mess. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=44.84s)]
*  Ken, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=48.36s)]
*  So let's talk about this effort from the Biden campaign, because there had been some recent criticism about the lack of outreach from [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Biden to some of these moderate or or never Trump Republicans. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  Chris Christie, Nikki Haley among them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=61.48s)]
*  But this is a square effort to try to get Haley's voters. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  Trump hasn't tried to bring them into his tent. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=67.92s)]
*  What does the Biden camp think they can do? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=70.16s)]
*  Yeah. Good morning, Jonathan. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=72.92s)]
*  You know, this is probably the most overt effort by the Biden campaign to reach those Nikki Haley supporters. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=74.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of behind the scenes work to connect with their donors to try to bring some of those on board. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=80.36s)]
*  But, you know, really, this ad is about reaching some of the Republicans who voted in in the primaries in battleground states like [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=86.96s)]
*  North Carolina, like Nevada, like Michigan, who supported Haley and might be of use in a general election. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=94.88s)]
*  I think there is certainly skepticism among some of the pollsters I speak to that that these voters would come over to Biden in large [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=102.0s)]
*  numbers. I mean, Haley's pitch to some of these voters was focused on Biden's age and the concerns that she had. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=110.2s)]
*  So it's not like this is a slam dunk for them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=117.96s)]
*  But I think, you know, in a marginal type race and some of these battleground states, Haley's supporters could be helpful. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=120.8s)]
*  And, you know, the key thing here is that Haley has not issued an endorsement yet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=128.28s)]
*  We don't know if she's going to endorse Trump or not. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  And so some of the some of her voters could be free agents as a result. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=135.92s)]
*  So let's talk about the possibility of third party candidates. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  A third party candidate could be a home for some Nikki Haley voters. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  The Biden campaign has been focusing on the more and more of late, the threat posed perhaps by Robert F. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=145.68s)]
*  Kennedy Jr., as well as No Labels, which is still struggling to find a person at the top of the ticket now dealing, of course, with the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  death of one of its founders, Joe Lieberman. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  Ken, give us your sense as to where things stand for No Labels and other third party bits. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  No Labels is really at a crossroads right now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=166.8s)]
*  You know, you mentioned they lost their founding chairman and Joe Lieberman last week. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=169.28s)]
*  Chris Christie said that he could not be involved with their organization. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=174.36s)]
*  He would not run as a third party candidate. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=179.88s)]
*  So they're really at a loss for finding the right candidate to head the ticket. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=183.12s)]
*  A lot of the sources I've spoken with around the organization have identified April 15th as an important time to have that ticket in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=189.04s)]
*  place because they're on the ballot in 19 states. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=197.64s)]
*  But to take that next step, they're going to need an actual ticket to be able to qualify for the ballot in some of these key [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=201.6s)]
*  battleground states. And ballot access really is just the most essential ingredient really for a third party candidate at this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  point, because if you're not on the ballot, you're not relevant. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=217.76s)]
*  And so, you know, they're really just right now struggling to find a candidate who can lead the ticket. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=221.28s)]
*  You know, they've been looking at Republicans as as the likely top of the ticket because it would insulate them from some of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=228.04s)]
*  the criticism that they faced about, you know, trying to elect Trump in the end. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  But, you know, it's a real very much a crossroads, I think, for the organization. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Ken, some reporting on No Labels you should check out on The Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=244.12s)]
*  So, Ken, let's talk about where the Biden campaign stands. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=247.48s)]
*  March, I believe they deem March a month of action or something like that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  It has come and gone. And it was a good month for the president, a well-received State of the Union address, a blitz of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=254.64s)]
*  battleground state travel far more than Donald Trump's been doing and a huge fundraising total capped off by that Radio City [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=260.0s)]
*  Music Hall event a few days ago. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=267.24s)]
*  So as we now turn the counter and we're in April, where do the Biden campaign, how do they feel that where things are going and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=269.68s)]
*  what's their next move? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=275.96s)]
*  They're just trying to keep the momentum going. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=277.76s)]
*  They've got the advantage on money right now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=279.68s)]
*  And I think right now they feel like a lot of their voters are starting to come home, that there's consolidation among the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=282.0s)]
*  base and they want to keep that going in the battleground states. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=288.0s)]
*  Yeah, Biden campaign with momentum, Donald Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=291.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, two weeks from today has to appear in the Manhattan courtroom at the start of a criminal trial. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=293.64s)]
*  White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=300.36s)]
*  Terrific reporting as always. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uJrireYbg0&t=302.48s)]
