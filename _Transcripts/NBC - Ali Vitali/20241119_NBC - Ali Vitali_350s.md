# Trump to join Elon Musk at SpaceX launch
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8)
*  This spaceship came down and I saw those engines firing and it looked like it was over, it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=0.0s)]
*  was going to smash. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=7.16s)]
*  And then I saw the fire pour out from the left side and I put it straight and it came [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=8.16s)]
*  down so gently and then it wrapped those arms around it and it held it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=14.08s)]
*  And just like you hold your baby at night, your little baby. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=19.72s)]
*  And it was a beautiful thing to see and I called Elon and I said, Elon, was that you? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=24.12s)]
*  He said, yes, it was. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=29.88s)]
*  I said, who else can do that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=32.32s)]
*  Can Russia do it? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=33.84s)]
*  No. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=34.72s)]
*  Can China do it? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=35.16s)]
*  No. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=36.2s)]
*  Can the United States do it other than, you know, nobody can do that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=37.72s)]
*  I said, that's why I love you, Elon. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=41.56s)]
*  That's great. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=45.92s)]
*  That was president-elect Donald Trump on election night for some reason, bolstering [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  the latest achievement of billionaire Elon Musk. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  So according to a source close to Trump, he plans to accompany Musk today at the next [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=53.32s)]
*  SpaceX test launch. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=59.16s)]
*  That's in Texas. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  While the friendship between the pair seems to be flourishing, there are reports that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Musk has been clashing with others in Trump's inner circle. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=67.16s)]
*  Joining us now to talk about that, national political correspondent for Politico, Meredith [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=71.56s)]
*  McGrath. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=75.72s)]
*  Meredith, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=76.24s)]
*  So let's start there with just this sort of outsized influence that Musk now has in Trump [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=77.4s)]
*  world. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=83.64s)]
*  You know, he obviously was a big part of his election campaign and now seems ever present [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=84.16s)]
*  at Trump's sides. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Talk to us as to how that's going, good and bad. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=90.56s)]
*  Musk is spending a lot of time in Trump's orbit, if you will, not to use a pun here, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=94.32s)]
*  but Musk was a really, he played a really important role in the 2024 election for Donald [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=99.96s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=106.28s)]
*  The Trump campaign outsourced a lot of their campaigns, ground game to organizations like [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=106.88s)]
*  the PAC that Musk funded in Pennsylvania, for example. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=113.84s)]
*  And he has been with Donald Trump ever since he won the election a few weeks ago. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=118.16s)]
*  He's been with Donald Trump at the club as he's making important decisions about his [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=124.44s)]
*  cabinet, as he's been on the phone with world leaders. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  And as he's just gone about his day at Trump's clubs down in Palm Beach and he's been [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=131.72s)]
*  offering his insight, he's been offering his input at times, he's been endorsing different [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=138.24s)]
*  people for different jobs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=142.8s)]
*  Most recently, Howard Lutnick for Treasury Secretary, which still has not picked, has [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=144.56s)]
*  not been picked. And of course, Musk is also going to be in charge of this Department of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=149.72s)]
*  Government Efficiency, which is going to be essentially a committee where people can make [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=156.12s)]
*  recommendations of areas to cut government waste. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  But for Musk, somebody who has these private companies, he's essentially going to be in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=166.92s)]
*  charge of coming up with regulations for the very regulators who have control over some [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=173.88s)]
*  of the different parts of his companies. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, let's let's dig a little closer on that new department, which is more of a blue [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=186.64s)]
*  ribbon panel than an apartment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=190.44s)]
*  And it's named after a cryptocurrency doge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=191.8s)]
*  How real is this? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=194.56s)]
*  Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy going to lead it? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  Like, how much power do you think it will really have? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=197.64s)]
*  What sort of fundamental changes could it bring to the American government? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=200.56s)]
*  Well, you know, Elon Musk has talked about cutting as much as two trillion dollars. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=206.04s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy has talked about cutting different agencies and contractors. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=211.44s)]
*  But like you said, this is essentially a blue ribbon committee. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=219.48s)]
*  They're going to be taking recommendations from people from areas where they can cut waste. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=223.44s)]
*  And ultimately, it's important to remember that Congress holds the purse strings for the budget. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=227.56s)]
*  And so they'll be making recommendations for areas to cut. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  But it's really up to Congress. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  So, Meredith, we've been talking a lot in recent days about how Donald Trump really [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=239.28s)]
*  doesn't like sharing the spotlight with anyone else. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=243.52s)]
*  And Musk is someone who's just about as famous as he is and is seemingly everywhere right now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=246.12s)]
*  What are the chances? What are you hearing about some of the growing friction in the inner circle with Musk? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=252.52s)]
*  Well, some aides in Trump circles view Musk with some skepticism for how much time he's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=259.76s)]
*  spending around Trump, for the input that he's been providing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=265.16s)]
*  But at the same time, we've seen how Trump's family members have really embraced him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=269.76s)]
*  Trump continues to marvel at Musk. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=274.32s)]
*  He was with Donald Trump when he went to the UFC fight in New York. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=277.68s)]
*  I was just watching a podcast yesterday with Donald Trump Jr. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=282.76s)]
*  And he was basically gushing about Musk and how they spent time on the plane talking about different ideas about space. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=286.24s)]
*  So I think there are some advisors and aides around Donald Trump who do feel like Musk is wearing out his welcome a little bit. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=295.4s)]
*  And Trump has even joked about how he can't get rid of Musk at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=302.4s)]
*  But for now, it does seem to be like there's some some mutual fascination between Musk and Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=306.6s)]
*  And a relationship is going to require a lot of scrutiny going forward, considering all the contracts that Musk has with the U.S. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=313.72s)]
*  government. You know, he has the ability to make decisions that could end up being very profitable for himself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=319.8s)]
*  We will see. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=326.04s)]
*  Yeah, we have so many conflicts of interest. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFdgrFNv1n8&t=327.32s)]
