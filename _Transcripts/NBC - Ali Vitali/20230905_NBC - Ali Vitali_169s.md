# Proud Boys leader to be sentenced Tuesday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y)
*  Where on the legal front convicted Proud Boys Lieutenant Joseph Biggs is hoping that Trump is elected in 2024 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Because he's certain the former president would pardon him if he retook office [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=6.88s)]
*  Last week Biggs was sentenced to 17 years in prison for his role in the January 6 riots [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=11.84s)]
*  Prosecutors originally sought 33 years [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=17.8s)]
*  Trump hasn't said whether he'll consider pardons for the Proud Boys specifically [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=20.6s)]
*  But has said he before that he would pardon a large portion of rioters if he were to return to the White House [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=24.8s)]
*  Later today Proud Boys leader Enrique Tario will learn his fate [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=32.32s)]
*  Prosecutors are seeking a 30 year 33 year sentence for him as well [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=37.28s)]
*  They described Tario as someone who possessed massive popular influence over the members of his group [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=41.36s)]
*  Adding that because of this and his motives a quote [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=47.6s)]
*  significant sentence is necessary [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now to help us walk through it MSNBC legal analyst Danny Savalas Danny great to see you again [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  So let's start with that man Enrico Tario. He'll be sentenced today [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=60.5s)]
*  Two other members of the Proud Boys [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  Received substantial sentences, but also significantly less than what DOJ had asked for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=66.92s)]
*  Why do you think that happened and what should we expect for Tario because DOJ often asks for pretty high? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=73.44s)]
*  Sentences and the court is not required any longer to follow the sentencing guidelines in other words [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=79.22s)]
*  They have to calculate them. They have to take them into consideration [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=84.22s)]
*  But they can go below what the sentencing guideline range suggests and they do that fairly often although not so much in violent [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=86.9s)]
*  Type crimes like this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=94.82s)]
*  But it's long been believed and this is coming from a defense attorney that the federal sentencing guidelines often result in a pretty draconian [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=96.1s)]
*  Sentencing range now you may look at these defendants and say draconian schmackonian [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=103.66s)]
*  No problem. I don't care what sentence they get but just to give you an idea [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=107.62s)]
*  If the key to today is will the governor or will the judge apply the terrorism enhancement that? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=112.34s)]
*  Enhancement alone could add about 15 years to a sentence it is [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=119.06s)]
*  unbelievably punitive of anyone who engages in any kind of terrorism activity [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=124.22s)]
*  Which is probably the way Americans like to see it if you engage in terrorism the sentencing guidelines will boost your sentence [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=128.70000000000002s)]
*  Into the stratosphere and let's remember late last week [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=136.1s)]
*  There was one January 6 rider who had begged the court for mercy still got ten years and then on his way out of the courtroom [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=139.38s)]
*  Screamed Trump won so this factors into how to change looking into all of this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=144.46s)]
*  You [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kudugWTEF6Y&t=165.9s)]
