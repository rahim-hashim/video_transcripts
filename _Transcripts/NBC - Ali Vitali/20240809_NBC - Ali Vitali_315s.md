# Harris leading Trump by six points in new 2024 polling
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y)
*  Welcome back. New polling shows a very tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. The Marquette University Law School Harris leads poll Trump Harris leads Trump by six points 53 to 47 among likely voters nationwide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  That's within the margin of error but marks a real shift from Marquette's last poll conducted in May which showed Donald Trump leading President Biden by two points. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=16.0s)]
*  Other polling shows similar movement towards Harris. Joining us now contributor to the conservative website the bulwark Tim Miller. He previously served as communications director for Jeb Bush and spokesman for the RNC. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=25.0s)]
*  Tim good to see you this morning. Let's talk big picture here. We've also had the Cook political report move three states from lean Republican to toss up Georgia Nevada Arizona. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=37.0s)]
*  Seems like Harris has momentum and from what we saw yesterday Donald Trump doesn't know how to respond. Seems like he might even be panicking. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=47.0s)]
*  He definitely looks like he's panicking. He definitely thinks he's losing. You know before the break you're talking about the debates and how now Donald Trump wants three. I mean I think it's a pretty good rule of thumb that a candidate that wants more debates is the candidate that thinks they're losing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=56.0s)]
*  If Donald Trump thought he was winning he wouldn't debate out and we know that for sure because he refused to debate in the primary because he was winning the whole time. So I think the Trump campaign thinks they're losing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=71.0s)]
*  I think that he has behavior yesterday during that weird press conference showed it. And you know but I also still think it's a very close race that Marquette pulls a bit of an outlier. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=81.0s)]
*  Let's see how things look. You know sometimes it takes a few weeks for big changes in a race to like really sink in with voters and sink in with the polls. We've had so many big changes over the last few weeks. So I think that maybe you don't get too exuberant if you're in the Harris Walls team right now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=92.0s)]
*  But certainly the arrow is pointing in the right direction. Yeah I could not agree more. They've got momentum. They'll have more coming out of their convention most likely. But this is still a very close close race. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=109.0s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about the Trump side a little more. You know they seem to be scrambling for attack lines here and for what and to me and most Republicans I've spoken to said they haven't found anything that seems effective. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=120.0s)]
*  You know isn't the talk about race and crowd size that's just going to alienate voters. What should they be talking about. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=131.0s)]
*  Yeah there's this group called Blueprint that's under a central left advocacy group that put out a poll. It was an internal poll where they tested what the Harris Walls vulnerabilities are. And it's the traditional issues you know it's like going back to a race from 2000 if the Republicans called the Democratic ticket you know a bunch of California liberals. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=138.0s)]
*  I mean like that's the stuff that works related to immigration. I think that some voters you know some of the key swing voters that's who we're talking about here pretty small group. A lot of these voters you know if you look at Georgia for example which is a red state not too long ago these are people that voted for Romney voted for Bush and then you know don't like Trump and so they switched to Biden. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=159.0s)]
*  You know some of those voters might not like this ticket's policy background on various issues particularly immigration and crime. That stuff works. The attacks that she's a DEI candidate the attacks on her race the attacks on Tim Walz's military experience. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=177.0s)]
*  You know all this stuff is just backfiring and the problem is that Trump likes that kind of attack right. And I think that it's hard to get a narrow focused attack on more anodyne policy issues when the person carrying your message is Donald Trump and he can't help himself. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=192.0s)]
*  But going to the more tawdry types of messages that just haven't seemed to work. So you mentioned Governor Walz we haven't talked to you since the vice president named him her running mate. Give us your assessment briefly about his strengths and weaknesses. What do you think he brings the ticket. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah it's clear they seem to like each other and so I mean that's good having a good you know good good mesh good vibe and the pairing matters. I think that he can speak he speaks like a normal person he speaks like a teacher right and that's good. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=228.0s)]
*  Sometimes the Democrats a lot of Democratic candidates maybe speak a little bit too much like the class valedictorian and like to speak in wonky policy terms and that's not Tim Walz I think that's good. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=242.0s)]
*  I think that the main weakness if you is political and not policy so this is not a judgment on any of his particular policies in Minnesota but he had a extremely progressive policy agenda successful policy agenda is why he was picked. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=253.0s)]
*  But I don't know I think that some Democrats think he might be able to help appeal to those moderate voters I was just talking about the people that may be voted for for Brian Kemp for governor in Georgia but also for Joe Biden for president. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=267.0s)]
*  I don't think he is going to really appeal much to them and I think that if the Republicans were disciplined about an ideological attack that could be vulnerable to that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=280.0s)]
*  The Harrison Walls team in the southwest next couple of days. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=290.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKJ5J1RiM0Y&t=309.0s)]
