# Jury resumes deliberations in Hunter Biden's criminal trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw)
*  While we're on verdict watch this morning in the Hunter Biden federal gun trial. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=0.0s)]
*  In just hours, the jury will resume deliberating for a second straight day in a Wilmington, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=4.24s)]
*  Delaware courthouse. The jury got the case late yesterday, following instructions from the judge [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=8.32s)]
*  and after hearing closing arguments from both the defense and the prosecution. Prosecutors laid out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  what they described as overwhelming evidence against the president's son. Hunter Biden's attorney [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=19.68s)]
*  argued that prosecutors had not met their burden of proof in terms of beyond the case beyond a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=25.2s)]
*  reasonable doubt. Earlier in the day, the defense rested its case without calling Hunter Biden to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  testify. First Lady Jill Biden was present in the audience for yesterday's proceedings as she has [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=36.64s)]
*  been throughout the trial. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to three felony counts tied to a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=43.2s)]
*  possession of a gun while using narcotics and lying on a government form. It's unclear how this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=49.28s)]
*  case will impact the presidential race, but certainly those close to President Biden are [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=54.48s)]
*  deeply concerned about the personal toll it will take on Hunter Biden's father. Joining us now, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  MSNBC justice and legal affairs analyst Anthony Coley. He previously served as the top spokesperson [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=65.84s)]
*  for the for attorney general Merrick Garland. Anthony, good to see you this morning here on [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=72.56s)]
*  set in Washington. Let's talk about the Hunter Biden case first. What's your read on yesterday's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=76.72s)]
*  closing arguments? So here's what's so interesting about this case, Jonathan, is that there's a lot [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=82.96s)]
*  of circumstantial evidence here. We talked a lot about the passages in the book and then there are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  the text messages that all suggest that Hunter Biden was not sober during this period of time, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  but there is no smoking gun. There is no eyewitness here. So you can see a scenario where [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=99.35999999999999s)]
*  a jury says, you know, the government has not met as high burden of proof. That's the first thing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  The second thing to me is a lot of what's happening off the stand. The unconditional love [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=110.48s)]
*  this man is receiving from all of his family, not just through this trial, but through his period [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=115.76s)]
*  of addiction. And number two, this reiteration that we heard from the president last week that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  he is going to respect the jury's verdict and even if they return a not guilty verdict that he would [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=126.16s)]
*  not pardon his son. And I can tell you if the shoe were on the other front, not only would Donald [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=132.32s)]
*  Trump not make that promise. This case, a case of a similar, a case looking at his family, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=136.72s)]
*  you can see a scenario where he would not even have let it get this far. You know, he would [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=145.12s)]
*  have practically burned down the justice department if an Obama era U.S. attorney was investigating [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  his family. And Biden has been very hands off. Briefly, what's the rule of thumb in terms of how [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=156.96s)]
*  long the jury will deliberate? Can we get a verdict today? We could very well get a verdict today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  One day of jury deliberation for every week that the trial went on. That's the general rule of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=168.16s)]
*  thumb. But you could also see a scenario here where they come back with, they tell the judge [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=173.84s)]
*  that, you know, we've deliberated for a couple of days that, you know, we don't have a verdict or [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=179.44s)]
*  we're split. The judge could go back and tell them to continue deliberating. We'll turn to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=184.16000000000003s)]
*  Trump and just one more quick beat on this. Do you think the prosecution proved their case? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  You know, I'm not the lawyer, so I'm not going to render my verdict. But I hope that Hunter Biden [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=191.84s)]
*  will be able to move on with his life. All right. So let's turn to Donald Trump's probation interview [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=198.32s)]
*  yesterday. It's a standard part of the procedure, about 30 minutes or so. But tell us why it matters. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=202.56s)]
*  And that includes because if he ends up with probation, he's not allowed to associate with [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=208.4s)]
*  other people who have criminal records themselves or spend prison time. And at this point, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=213.44s)]
*  have a gun. At that point, that's a lot of people in his universe, including just as a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  day ago, Steve Bannon. That's exactly right. What's also interesting here are the factors that go into [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=222.88s)]
*  whatever report that the probation officer provides. Right. And you've got to imagine that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=228.0s)]
*  they're going to consider Donald Trump's efforts to accept the norms and the rules. And we know [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=232.96s)]
*  from just looking at this case, this is the man who has violated the norms and the rules, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=239.84s)]
*  you know, 10 different times he refused to accept this narrowly tailored gag order. So, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=244.88s)]
*  you know, it's going to be interesting to see how this one plays out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=252.16s)]
*  We are now precisely one month from Donald Trump's sentencing. Today is June 11th. That comes [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=255.76s)]
*  July 11th. This probation hearing yesterday, what are there other markers, other things we should, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=261.68s)]
*  procedures or events we should be looking for between now and that sentencing in a month? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=267.12s)]
*  No, I think right now what typically happens in the process is that the probation officer will [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=271.84s)]
*  prepare a report for the judge. And the judge obviously is the one that's going to make [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=276.56s)]
*  whatever determination he feels is appropriate in this case. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  And we will see if that includes prison time. MSNBC Justice and Legal Affairs Analyst, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=284.56s)]
*  Anthony Coley, thank you. Good to see you as always. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=289.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0M9fStNfOw&t=301.84s)]
