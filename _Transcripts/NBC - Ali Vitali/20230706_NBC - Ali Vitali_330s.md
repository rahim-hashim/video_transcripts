# Biden headed to SC to promote infrastructure plan
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs)
*  Welcome back. In just a few hours, President Joe Biden will be on his way to South Carolina. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=0.0s)]
*  The president is slated to deliver a speech promoting his massive infrastructure agenda. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=6.8s)]
*  South Carolina, of course, a key state for this president. Biden won the Democratic primary [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=12.36s)]
*  there in 2020. There in 2020, after falling behind the states, his campaign seemingly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=17.56s)]
*  on life support. Then the turnaround. Earlier this year, Biden pushed for a plan to make [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=21.72s)]
*  South Carolina the first state in the lineup for the Democratic primaries. Joining us now, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=27.0s)]
*  a man who spent plenty of time in South Carolina, NBC News White House correspondent Mike Memley. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=33.08s)]
*  So let's start there with before we get to the politics of the primaries, let's just simply [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=38.44s)]
*  start, Mike, with the president's trip today and what is he trying to push and how is it in some [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=43.0s)]
*  ways a subtle bit of campaigning? Yeah, Jonathan, obviously this is part of the White House's invest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=50.92s)]
*  in America tour meant to highlight all the different pieces of economic legislation the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  president has signed into law and the ways in which it's creating a manufacturing boom, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=64.36s)]
*  as the White House argues in this country. And South Carolina is an example of that. He's going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=68.68s)]
*  to be talking about a new partnership between Enphase Energy and Flex that will create 600 new [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=72.12s)]
*  jobs in South Carolina, 1800 in the U.S. It's part of $11 billion, the White House says, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=78.36s)]
*  in manufacturing and clean energy investments in South Carolina as a result of these laws. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=83.48s)]
*  Part of the message here as we get more into a campaign cycle here is that Republicans in [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=89.08s)]
*  South Carolina and across the country voted against these economic investments. And even though, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=95.88s)]
*  as the president has vowed to be a president for all Americans, a lot of the benefits of these [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=101.8s)]
*  economic legislation are happening in red states. They're happening in red counties. And so he's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  really trying to increasingly not just tout his own accomplishments, but call out Republicans for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=112.2s)]
*  opposing them. Yeah, that's become a favorite play of his, especially when he can point out [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Republicans touting the achievements of the bills without actually having, of course, voted for them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=121.56s)]
*  So Mike, as you well know and as we mentioned a moment ago, the president's remarkable comeback [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  in the 2020 primary process really started in South Carolina. Help from an endorsement from [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=133.0s)]
*  Congressman Jim Clyburn there. Look, South Carolina is not in play in 2024. It's a red state. But it's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=139.16s)]
*  still politics loom large here because the way the White House pushed the DNC to change its calendar, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=144.68s)]
*  to put South Carolina first. But there's been some blowback from Iowa and New Hampshire. Give us the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=149.4s)]
*  latest as to where things stand. Yeah, Jonathan, I remember full well. I was in Manchester on primary [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=154.76s)]
*  day in 2020 when then candidate Joe Biden made that stunning announcement that he would leave [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=161.24s)]
*  the state and go to South Carolina on the night of the New Hampshire primary to sort of signal where [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  his focus was going to be. As he argued, the diversity of the party was better reflected in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=171.4s)]
*  a state like South Carolina than Iowa and New Hampshire, where, of course, he finished in the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=175.88s)]
*  back of the pack. Now, what's interesting here as New Hampshire Democrats, really, they expected [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=179.8s)]
*  Iowa to lose its place at the beginning of the calendar, but they were really blindsided by the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=183.96s)]
*  president's decision to put South Carolina at the front of the line. And there were a lot of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=188.04s)]
*  arguments on the politics that they made about why New Hampshire should stay first. But the real [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  issue here is New Hampshire state law. New Hampshire has been the first in the nation primary for 100 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=195.32s)]
*  years because the New Hampshire state law says it has to be. It has to come seven days before any [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=200.28s)]
*  other election. And the New Hampshire secretary of state, now Dave Scanlon for a long time, Bill [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=205.72s)]
*  Gardner, has been masterful at maneuvering to keep New Hampshire at the head of the pack. So in every [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=210.2s)]
*  likelihood, despite this new DNC calendar, New Hampshire will be the first in the nation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=215.24s)]
*  sometime in January. And the Biden campaign is going to face a real interesting challenge. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  They can either just simply not have the president file for reelection, which guarantees somebody [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=224.28s)]
*  else, likely RFK Jr. will win that primary, or maybe they need to sort of push a write-in campaign. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=229.24s)]
*  But that's no guarantee of success. One top New Hampshire Democrat told me that would be incredibly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=236.36s)]
*  expensive in order to be successful. And so either way, the president's going to have [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  some tough headlines on the first in the nation primary when it happens next January. Campaign [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=245.08s)]
*  advisors say, listen, the big story you're going to cover out of New Hampshire is who wins the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=249.8s)]
*  Republican primary. We'll take our lumps, but ultimately this is not going to be an issue. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=253.0s)]
*  So Mike, real quick, I mean, you know, Marianne Williamson dismissed out of hand as a Democratic [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=256.92s)]
*  challenger. There's been talk about Cornel West where he might fit in. But Robert RFK Jr. at least [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=261.08s)]
*  has name recognition. I mean, even though so many of his views are completely, frankly, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=265.88s)]
*  out of control and wrong, how does the Biden team looking at him? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=270.44s)]
*  Officially, they don't acknowledge him, but there's really this point that the more people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=274.6s)]
*  hear about his views, the more unpalatable that he will be to Democratic voters. The issue is, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=278.44s)]
*  if you look at the 2012 election, Barack Obama only got about 81% of the vote when he faced really no [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=283.48s)]
*  credible challenger in New Hampshire. And so it's going to be an uncomfortable situation no matter [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=289.08s)]
*  what. As we're going to see, RFK get really double digit margins in some of these low turnout [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=293.88s)]
*  primaries throughout the cycle. All right. Well, we appreciate the reporting as always NBC News [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=298.28s)]
*  White House correspondent Mike Memley. And thank you very much. And of course, we'll have coverage [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=303.4s)]
*  of the president's trip to South Carolina later today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=307.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8PB6qgUZUs&t=323.88s)]
