# January 6 Panel Releases Video Of Capitol Tour On January 5
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU)
*  Ahead of today's hearing, the January 6th Select Committee released new video that shows Republican Congressman Barry Loudermilk giving a tour of the Capitol complex the day before the attack. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=0.0s)]
*  Among those taking part in the congressman's tour, a man who the committee says was filmed making verbal threats against top Democratic lawmakers on the day of the insurrection. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=11.0s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=21.0s)]
*  It has begun. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=23.0s)]
*  Here at the Washington Monument, Washington DC. Say hello to Facebook. Hey, what's going on man? Glad to be here, bro. This is our fearless leader. Hey, check out my flag I made guys. See it. There you go. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=26.0s)]
*  That's right. That's right. That's for somebody. Somebody special. Somebody special. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=42.0s)]
*  Alright, we are basically at the Capitol. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=49.0s)]
*  We're probably close to two million true American patriots. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=60.0s)]
*  They are swarming and converging mainly from Constitution Avenue, but from all routes in. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=69.0s)]
*  There's no escape Pelosi. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=80.0s)]
*  Schumer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=83.0s)]
*  Nadler. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=87.0s)]
*  We're coming for you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=91.0s)]
*  We're coming in like white on rice. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=94.0s)]
*  Pelosi, Nadler, Schumer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=97.0s)]
*  Even you AOC. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=103.0s)]
*  We're coming to take you out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=105.0s)]
*  Pull you out by your hairs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=108.0s)]
*  How about that Pelosi? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=112.0s)]
*  You might as well make yourself another appointment. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=115.0s)]
*  I'll get done with you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=120.0s)]
*  You're going to need a sign up on top of that bald head. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=122.0s)]
*  The video stunning goes on to show the surveillance footage of Congressman Loudermilk. You're seeing it here giving his tour. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=127.0s)]
*  Some individuals can be seen taking photos of staircases, tunnels and security checkpoints that are used daily by lawmakers and their staff. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=135.0s)]
*  Congressman Loudermilk initially denied giving a tour at all on January 5th, but in a statement last month he conceded that he had brought constituents into parts of the Capitol complex and called the visit harmless. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=144.0s)]
*  He was asked about this new footage yesterday. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=156.0s)]
*  Do you know who that man was in the video? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=160.0s)]
*  I don't know him. I'd never met him before. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=163.0s)]
*  But he was on that tour with you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=165.0s)]
*  I don't know. I never saw the guy on the video. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=167.0s)]
*  In the video, it clearly shows an individual taking photos of a security checkpoint in the basement that leads to the Capitol. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=169.0s)]
*  What they were taking a picture of is I took the family and of course the other folks were with them to have two young kids that wanted to see the little trains that take congressmen. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=177.0s)]
*  So I took them to show them where the trolley was in the raven tunnel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=188.0s)]
*  But why do you think pictures were being taken of a stairwell around security? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=193.0s)]
*  If you go to that stairwell, there's a Golden Eagle sconce that's on the wall. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=197.0s)]
*  That's what I was taking a picture of. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=202.0s)]
*  I mean, these are folks who have never been to Washington, D.C. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=204.0s)]
*  And they were excited. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=207.0s)]
*  So why not just speak to the committee and just... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=208.0s)]
*  Because the committee's never called me and asked me anything. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=210.0s)]
*  They sent a letter asking for your voluntary cooperation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=212.0s)]
*  To who? They never sent it to me. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=214.0s)]
*  Joining us now, congressional reporter for The Guardian, Hugo Lowell, who's been all over the January 6 hearings. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=218.0s)]
*  Hugo, let's start there with Congressman Loudermilk and backing up a step just to say this is what Democratic lawmakers have said they were fearful of. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=224.0s)]
*  Ayo Congressman Ocasio-Cortez said she believes she was being individually targeted on January 6. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=233.0s)]
*  Law enforcement officials told me in the aftermath of the insurrection their great fear was that some Democratic lawmaker could be injured or executed on a live stream if the rioters had found them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=239.0s)]
*  What sort of role is this footage going to play in the hearings? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=249.0s)]
*  What new questions does it raise? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=252.0s)]
*  It's not clear how the footage is going to play into the hearings. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=255.0s)]
*  But while the hearings are still going on, this January 6 select committee is still continuing its investigation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=259.0s)]
*  So insofar as that continues, I think it's going to loom large in the minds of House investigators that are still trying to untangle exactly what happened and whether Republican lawmakers were connected in any way to the Capitol attack. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=265.0s)]
*  I think the man in question here is quite interesting because the identity of the man is known to us and it's also known to NBC as far as I'm aware. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=278.0s)]
*  We're withholding the identity of the man to protect the integrity of the investigation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=288.0s)]
*  But that man left his point of origin on January 4, took a bus to D.C. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=292.0s)]
*  over the course of January 4 and got to D.C. in the evening of January 4, maybe in the early hours of January 5, proceeded to take this tour around 1 p.m. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=300.0s)]
*  on January 5. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=308.0s)]
*  And then the next day he was at the base of the Capitol marching with thousands upon thousands of Trump supporters descending onto the Capitol. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=309.0s)]
*  So this man came to D.C. specifically to take part in the ellipse rally on January 6, which Trump was hoping would stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=316.0s)]
*  So when we play and we think about what the man was doing on the 6th and then we look back in what he was doing on the 5th, taking photos of stairwells and security checkpoints, it does make us look at that tour in a different light. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=327.0s)]
*  Hugo, to underscore the importance of the answer, we're actually watching some lightning flash over your shoulder as you're talking. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=339.0s)]
*  Glad you're inside. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=346.0s)]
*  Tell us though about today. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=348.0s)]
*  We heard previewed earlier in the show that today's hearing is going to be predominantly focused on the pressure campaign from former President Trump to then Vice President Pence. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=349.0s)]
*  It starts at one o'clock today. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=358.0s)]
*  MSNBC will have complete coverage preview for viewers. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=360.0s)]
*  What sort of things we're going to hear? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=363.0s)]
*  Well, it's going to be all about Trump's pressure campaign on Pence and how you're trying to get his vice president to overturn the results of the election. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=365.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=372.0s)]
*  And a lot of the centers on this one man, John Eastman, the external Trump legal advisor, really a college professor who got drafted in to help the campaign since Trump decided that his own campaign staff and his own White House counsel weren't doing enough to go after election fraud and to find alternative ways to return him to the presidency. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=373.0s)]
*  And that issue are these two points. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=392.0s)]
*  First of all, that Eastman wanted to use these alternate slates of electors that have not been certified and did not exist as the basis for Pence to refuse to count the votes for Biden at the certification on January 6th. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=394.0s)]
*  And this is really interesting to me, at least because Eastman has admitted in emails that have since come out in court filings that he knew that the entire plan, the entire scheme rested on there being genuinely certified alternate slates of electors for Trump. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=408.0s)]
*  By the time he got to January 2nd, January 3rd, and he was starting to meet with Trump and Pence, he knew that the states had not certified those alternate slates of electors. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=423.0s)]
*  And he knew full well that he needed that to happen for his plan to have any basis in legality. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=431.0s)]
*  As it turns out, it was completely unlawful anyway, and he admitted that in subsequent emails. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=436.0s)]
*  But then he was pressuring Pence to effectively throw out the results of the entire election based on states of electors that didn't exist. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=441.0s)]
*  So you have all sorts of corrupt intent, all sorts of really problematic legal analysis. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=448.0s)]
*  And I think Judge Ludwig, who is testifying today, is expected to say at the hearing that the legal analysis was completely wrong and the entire plan was nonsense. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=453.0s)]
*  So that's what's in store for us later today. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ee9B28aDvU&t=483.0s)]
