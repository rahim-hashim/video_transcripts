# Nikki Haley calls Trump 'totally unhinged' during rally
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0)
*  We turn now to the 2024 presidential race. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=2.96s)]
*  escalated her attacks against former president Donald Trump [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=5.28s)]
*  over the weekend while campaigning in her home state [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=8.28s)]
*  of South Carolina. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  This time, she went after his mental stability [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=12.72s)]
*  while discussing her second place [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=15.48s)]
*  finish in the recent New Hampshire primary. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=17.48s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=20.48s)]
*  Donald Trump was totally unhinged. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=22.92s)]
*  Unhinged. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  He was a bit sensitive. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  And I think that it... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=31.48s)]
*  And I think his feelings were hurt. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=33.2s)]
*  But he threw a temper tantrum out on stage, seriously. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=34.64s)]
*  Threw a total temper tantrum. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=37.64s)]
*  And was talking about revenge. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=40.64s)]
*  So after he talked about revenge [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=43.24s)]
*  and had a little of something to say about me, that's fine, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=46.56s)]
*  we raised a million dollars online right after he did that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=51.36s)]
*  CHEERING [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=54.6s)]
*  Haley followed up those comments [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=56.8s)]
*  with an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press yesterday, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=58.4s)]
*  doubling down by questioning Trump's mental competency. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=61.24s)]
*  Factful, it's the fact that when you're 80, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=66.24s)]
*  you are declining. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=67.92s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=69.24s)]
*  And so, look, there are multiple things [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=70.36s)]
*  that I think are the reason he should not be president. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=72.24s)]
*  That's the whole reason I'm running. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=74.84s)]
*  I do think that he is in decline. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=76.36s)]
*  And I think that he needs to know to step away. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=78.44s)]
*  I do think that he surrounds himself in chaos. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=81.28s)]
*  And we can't be a country in disarray [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=83.84s)]
*  and have a world on fire and be in chaos. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=85.68s)]
*  I do think that these court cases are distracting, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=87.76s)]
*  not just to the American people, but to him himself, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=90.44000000000001s)]
*  which is keeping him from talking about what really matters. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Haley also revealed that her campaign [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=96.84s)]
*  had its best fundraising week ever last week, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  bringing in $4 million since the New Hampshire primary. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump put the campaign trail in Nevada [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  over the weekend in Las Vegas on Saturday. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=108.56s)]
*  Trump bragged at length about his ability [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  to pass the cognitive test. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, he struggled to get basic words out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  and made a number of highly questionable statements. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=119.04s)]
*  And if I'm a little bit dweat, a little... [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=123.64s)]
*  They say, oh, he was sweating. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=125.92s)]
*  He was sweating. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think there are too many people up here [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=129.56s)]
*  that wouldn't be sweating. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=131.32s)]
*  Not too many people could speak the first paragraph. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=132.84s)]
*  We're the first non-incumbened... [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=135.28s)]
*  And remember this, look at this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=138.6s)]
*  Caucus on February 1st. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=140.08s)]
*  We got Mexico to send 2,000, 28,000 troops. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=142.16s)]
*  Remember this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  And Tim Scott was relating that story today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=146.84s)]
*  In history, they say the president [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=150.56s)]
*  that was treated the worst was Abraham Lincoln. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=152.92s)]
*  But I haven't seen the new list, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=155.6s)]
*  but if I'm not number one over Abraham Lincoln, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=157.56s)]
*  I will be very disappointed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=160.92s)]
*  On top of it all, Crooked Joe and I call him thugs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=162.48s)]
*  They're persecuting Catholics. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=167.0s)]
*  Anybody in here Catholic? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=168.6s)]
*  We will restore on this planet peace through earth. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=169.96s)]
*  Just about all of that was wrong or at least confusing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=175.52s)]
*  We should note that Trump's team [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  and the Nevada state party more or less rigged their caucus. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=179.84s)]
*  So that's the next contest. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=183.44s)]
*  He's already got that one. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=184.72s)]
*  Really the one that matters is South Carolina [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  in a couple of weeks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=188.36s)]
*  That's where Nikki Haley is spending her time. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG37klBbNK0&t=189.20000000000002s)]
