# Nikki Haley racks up votes in Maryland and Nebraska
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc)
*  Welcome back. We turn back to politics now and Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia held primaries last night and a large percentage of Republican voters continue to cast their ballots for Nikki Haley. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=0.0s)]
*  Despite the fact that she dropped out of the GOP race more than two months ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=11.4s)]
*  According to the NBC News decision desk, Haley pulled in about 20% of the vote in Maryland's Republican primary and in Nebraska, the former staff Carolina governor won about 18% of that party's vote. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=15.9s)]
*  There were several other notable races last night. West Virginia's term limited Republican governor Jim Justice, well, he won the Senate GOP primary. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=28.9s)]
*  He is heavily favored to win the general election there and that would, of course, flip the seat currently being held by retiring Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, meaning Republicans likely just need to get one more state to get the majority. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=37.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, West Virginia's first congressional district Republican congresswoman Carol Miller defended her seat from Derek Evans, a January 6 rioter who was sentenced to three months in prison for his role in the Capitol insurrection. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=51.699999999999996s)]
*  In Maryland, former governor Larry Hogan won the state's GOP Senate primary and also in that state, former police officer Harry Dunn, who defended the Capitol on January 6th, lost his congressional bid to state Senator Sarah Elfrid. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=65.7s)]
*  Joining us now to talk about last night's results and some other political headlines is national politics reporter for the Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=81.7s)]
*  Good morning, Julia. Thanks so much. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=89.1s)]
*  Let's start with that Maryland Senate race. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=90.6s)]
*  Larry Hogan in talk to us about now who he will face and what are the expectations in the state that's awfully blue these days, but polls suggest we have a tight battle ahead. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Jonathan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=104.0s)]
*  This was certainly an interesting race to watch tonight because those of us that live in the Washington, D.C. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=105.5s)]
*  media market had been seeing ads for weeks from Congressman David Trout. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  Now, you'll remember that he started or one is one of the co-founders, co-owners of Total Wine, that big company. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=116.1s)]
*  He poured 62 million dollars of his own money into that race. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=122.5s)]
*  But what we learned last night is cash only means so much because we saw that Angela also Brooks from Prince George's County, an elected official just outside of Washington, D.C. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=128.0s)]
*  She won that Democratic Senate primary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=138.5s)]
*  Now, she had the backing of Maryland Governor Wes Moore as well as Congressman Jamie Raskin, etc. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  So she had the backing of a lot of major Maryland congressional figures and she went on to beat David Trout. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=147.4s)]
*  So, you know, David Trout in the run up to this primary was warning that if also Brooks were to win, it would be a tougher race against Hogan. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=154.0s)]
*  That being said, though, I think this is going to really come down to a nail biter in what is considered a blue state. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=164.0s)]
*  We're already seeing Democrats really seek to paint Hogan as ultra conservative, but we know that Hogan is one of the rare anti-Trump Republicans. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=170.4s)]
*  He will speak out against the former president. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=179.5s)]
*  So this is going to be an interesting race to watch in terms of what direction Hogan chooses to go to in terms of getting the Republican base in Maryland and also winning over [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=182.1s)]
*  moderator independent voters. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=192.4s)]
*  Remember, Hogan has already won a statewide race in Maryland. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=194.1s)]
*  So he's done this before. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And it'll be a fiercely contested battle for the Senate control. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=199.5s)]
*  Democrats lose Maryland. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=203.9s)]
*  They'd be in big trouble. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=205.4s)]
*  So, Julia, let's talk about other results last night, including Nikki Haley's ongoing impact with Republican voters. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=206.8s)]
*  She continues to put up pretty impressive numbers for a campaign that's been suspended for months. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=214.9s)]
*  Talk to us about Trump's efforts to win those voters back. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=219.5s)]
*  But also, what is President Biden's team looking to have doing the same? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=223.3s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I had one source describe this to me as Nikki Haley's zombie campaign. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=228.10000000000002s)]
*  We still see her getting a sizable portion of the GOP primary electorate, getting what? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=233.1s)]
*  20 to 25 percent in some of these races, including last night in Maryland and then the very critical swing states of Pennsylvania and Arizona. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=238.0s)]
*  You know, for Donald Trump, look, he told a local news station in Pennsylvania last week that essentially, look, this is a small portion of the primary electorate and that, you know, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=246.5s)]
*  a lot of these primary voters aren't actually Republicans. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=256.3s)]
*  They're moderates and independents. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=259.1s)]
*  That might be true in some cases, but people from Nikki Haley's orbit tell me that there still is, you know, voters coming back out from rural areas of these states to vote for Nikki Haley. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=260.70000000000005s)]
*  So there is a portion of the electorate, of the conservative electorate, that's still coming out for, you know, the former UN ambassador. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  But the question I get from a lot of Republicans who are sort of unsure what to make of this is, is this a protest vote against Donald Trump or is this a vote for Nikki Haley, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  the candidate that could have a big impact going into the general election in terms of whether these voters ultimately decide to vote for Biden or Trump? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=292.70000000000005s)]
*  Look, Democrats and Republicans sort of say, look, a lot of these voters, particularly the conservative ones, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  once they see the choice after the conventions of Biden versus Trump set in stone, the chances of them going to Biden are slim. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=307.5s)]
*  But when we talk about those moderate independent voters voting in these Republican primaries when they're open, that's where Biden could see an opening. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, there's been some speculation in the media that Haley could be one of Trump's VP picks. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  The GOP front owner has said, no, that's not going to happen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=328.0s)]
*  Lastly, Julia, and briefly, we saw some polls earlier this week that weren't great for the president. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=331.2s)]
*  His campaign, his team are saying, look, we simply don't believe them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=336.3s)]
*  We think we see momentum. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=338.8s)]
*  We think we're doing better. Democrats you speak to, do they share that sentiment? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  Look, they say it's way too early at this point. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=344.5s)]
*  And, you know, just to wrap it up, you know, kind of tie it to what we were talking about at the beginning of the second segment with Angela also Brooks. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=346.7s)]
*  Look, I mean, a lot of Democrats last night that I was texting with Democrats online were essentially saying Maryland's primary race shows us that you can't believe the polls. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=353.5s)]
*  Angela also Brooks was trailing Trone for, you know, at some points during that primary. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=363.1s)]
*  So they're pointing to that right now. And look, we're just a little less than six months out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  I think we're going to see more movement on the polar coaster as we get closer to November. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, those same polls suggest that some of those Senate candidates running ahead of President Biden in those states. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=377.3s)]
*  But we'll see if that lasts in between now and November. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  Good stuff, as always from National Politics Reporter for the Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=385.3s)]
*  Julia, thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTO5EMo9tZc&t=389.40000000000003s)]
