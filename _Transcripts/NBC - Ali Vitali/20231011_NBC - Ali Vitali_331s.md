# House GOP stalls push for linked Israel and Ukraine aid
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I)
*  So, we've seen some of those statements this weekend, and we're going to continue to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=0.0s)]
*  very clear. We believe they're wrong. We believe they're repugnant, and we believe they're [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=4.16s)]
*  disgraceful. Our condemnation belongs squarely with terrorists who have brutally murdered, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=8.72s)]
*  raped, kidnapped hundreds, hundreds of Israelis. There can be no equivocation about that. There [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=14.88s)]
*  are not two sides here. There are not two sides. President Biden has been clear on where [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=21.92s)]
*  he has stood. You heard him. You heard from him directly. That was White House press secretary [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=27.64s)]
*  Corinne Jean-Pierre yesterday with a sharp response to a question about lawmakers who have not issued [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=33.72s)]
*  full support to Israel. Several Democrats have so far only issued statements calling for a ceasefire [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=39.72s)]
*  and de-escalation. The Biden administration, meanwhile, is considering advancing USA to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=46.44s)]
*  both Israel and Ukraine and in doing so in a single package. Many House Republicans, however, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=52.36s)]
*  have voiced skepticism of that idea. Joining us now, a Democratic congresswoman, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=58.36s)]
*  Sydney Komlager Dove of the state of California. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=63.56s)]
*  this morning. Let's start there with what we just heard from the White House press secretary. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=68.68s)]
*  Sort of calling out some lawmakers who the White House doesn't feel like have been [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  appropriately supportive of Israel. What is your message to some of your colleagues who are sounding [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=77.32s)]
*  those tones? I come from a district that has a very vocal and diverse, politically diverse [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=81.08s)]
*  Jewish constituency. I have said repeatedly, I am in full solidarity with them as we stand with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=88.12s)]
*  Israel against these terrorist attacks by Hamas. Last night at our Democratic caucus, people were [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=94.28s)]
*  united and I think the president was crystal clear in our unwavering support of Israel, making sure [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=100.68s)]
*  they get the aid they need, making sure we're getting the hostages out and making sure everyone [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=108.36s)]
*  is working in accordance, democracies are working in accordance with international law. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=113.32s)]
*  So certainly though, the US's ability to support Israel is hampered by the lack of a speaker of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=118.12s)]
*  the House. We just talked earlier this show about that process. It in some ways begins in earnest [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=124.28s)]
*  today, but there's sort of an expectation that it may not conclude today. What is your sense as you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=129.64s)]
*  talk to your colleagues across the aisle as terms of when we might see a new speaker? Well, Democrats [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=134.28s)]
*  are squarely 100% behind Hakeem Jeffries. You know, we are open to a bipartisan path forward, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=139.4s)]
*  right? With the leader Jeffries. I think some Republicans may push back on that. That's true, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=145.88s)]
*  but the reality is these Republicans are petty. They're petty and they're pyromaniacs and they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=149.8s)]
*  set fire to Congress at the worst time. Do I think they can get it together today? Absolutely not. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=154.52s)]
*  They've proven that ego is far more important than the national security of this country or [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=160.28s)]
*  the security of our allies. And what do you make of the two announced candidates, Jim Jordan, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=164.44s)]
*  Steve Scalise? Do you think either of them would be an effective leader, someone you guys could work [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=170.2s)]
*  with? No. So one is an acolyte of David Duke and the other is a synchopent of Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=175.8s)]
*  Neither of those folks, to me, would be palatable to my district. And I don't think either of them [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=184.44s)]
*  understand what it means to build consensus. And certainly there are some who believe that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=190.76s)]
*  neither of them can reach that number of votes needed. So let's talk about aid, though. We just [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=194.44s)]
*  mentioned the White House has floated the idea of trying to connect Israel and Ukraine aid. We know [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=199.72s)]
*  that there are some voices that have been for some time now on the Republican side who are leery of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  sending much more money to Kiev. This might be a way to do that. What is your A, what do you think [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=212.52s)]
*  of the idea and B, do you think it can pass? I think it's a very strong idea. I think there [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=217.72s)]
*  are many Republicans that also support it as well. Enemies do tend to work together. We know that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=221.96s)]
*  Hamas is responsible for these attacks against Israel. They have close ties with Iran. We also [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=228.28s)]
*  know that Russia is responsible for compromising the security, the safety, the sovereignty, the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=234.28s)]
*  independence of Ukraine. They also have close ties with Iran. It makes sense that we work with [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=239.88s)]
*  our allies and our partners who are democracies and get them the aid that they need to upstand [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=245.4s)]
*  their countries and to beat back the terrorists, quite frankly, and the autocrats that don't care [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  about democracy. So you mean you just you just voiced it, a strong support for both Ukraine [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=257.24s)]
*  and Israel, strong support for democracies. But what sort of message do you fear it sends to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  rest of the world when they look at Washington and they see this infighting? And again, let's put the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=266.6s)]
*  we'll put it squarely on the House of Representatives, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=271.72s)]
*  that can't come together with a speaker or an aid package. What are your worries about the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=275.72s)]
*  message that sends to the rest of the globe? I think it's incredibly destabilizing. It's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=281.88s)]
*  emboldening our enemies and it's raising real concerns for our allies and our partners. You know, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm concerned that Europe is saying, hey, I don't know that we can, you know, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=293.0s)]
*  bet on the United States anymore. And I just don't think that's a position that we want to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=297.48s)]
*  see ourselves moving into. All right, Democratic Congresswoman Sydney Comlock-Radov of California. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=301.24s)]
*  She sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. We're grateful for her expertise this morning. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=306.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9krBVgUVq4I&t=323.0s)]
