# Questions mount over security lapses at Trump rally
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc)
*  While the investigation into the attempted assassination of Donald Trump continues, questions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=0.0s)]
*  continue to mount about the role of the U.S. Secret Service and how a gunman was able to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=5.88s)]
*  get within striking distance of the former president. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=11.28s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Stephanie Goss has the very latest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=14.48s)]
*  A new report that security around Donald Trump was increased in recent weeks because U.S. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=19.36s)]
*  intelligence learned of an Iranian plot to kill him, according to three officials briefed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=24.72s)]
*  on the matter, raising even more questions about how a 20 year old gunman in rural Pennsylvania, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=29.42s)]
*  with no apparent connection to the Iranian plot, was able to get on a rooftop last Saturday [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=34.54s)]
*  and open fire on the former president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=40.38s)]
*  Moments before Thomas Crooks targeted the podium, a Butler township police officer locked [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=43.22s)]
*  eyes with him, according to township manager Tom Nights. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=48.58s)]
*  He was able to pull his head up over the roof. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=51.72s)]
*  He did in fact see an individual on the roof with a weapon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=54.5s)]
*  The officer was responding to a report that someone suspicious was on the roof, fellow [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=58.78s)]
*  officers boosting him up to check it out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=63.7s)]
*  And what did the shooter do? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=66.54s)]
*  Turn towards him, had the barrel of his weapon pointed at the officer. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=68.18s)]
*  And at that point, the officer's hanging on to the side of the roof? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=73.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=78.5s)]
*  Unable to pull a gun out? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=79.5s)]
*  Unable to... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  Unable to defend himself? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=81.74000000000001s)]
*  Unable to reach his radio? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=83.18s)]
*  Any of that, yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=84.54s)]
*  Strictly defensive movement for him to lower his head, duck, lost his own grip, right, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=86.1s)]
*  fell approximately eight feet to the ground. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=93.74s)]
*  Knight says the officers radioed a message on a channel that included the Secret Service [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=96.14s)]
*  to say the suspicious person was in fact a gunman. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  He does not know how much time passed before the shooter opened fire. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=104.24s)]
*  This new video showing the moments after Secret Service tackled the former president to protect [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=109.22s)]
*  him. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=113.66s)]
*  The former township police were not responsible for the security of the building, according [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=114.7s)]
*  to Knight. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  But it's unclear which local agency was. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=119.89999999999999s)]
*  The Secret Service says it was outside of their security perimeter and was primarily [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=122.97999999999999s)]
*  the responsibility of local law enforcement, even though the rooftop had a vantage point [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  148 yards from the podium. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=132.98s)]
*  The AR-15 or variations, the M4, has a maximum effective range of 656 yards. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  Retired Secret Service agent Rich Starapoli also worked for the Department of Homeland [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=142.94s)]
*  Security under Trump. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=147.18s)]
*  That building was nowhere near the out of perimeter. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=148.78s)]
*  There is no excuse for not having someone posted on the roof of that building. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=151.1s)]
*  The Secret Service tells ABC News that no one was put on the roof because it was dangerously [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=155.26s)]
*  sloped. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=159.5s)]
*  That argument called into question because of images like these. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=160.66s)]
*  The Secret Service did not respond to NBC News' multiple requests for comment, putting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=164.34s)]
*  out a statement on X overnight. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=168.18s)]
*  We are deeply grateful to the officers who ran towards danger to locate the gunman and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=170.62s)]
*  to all our local partners for their unwavering commitment. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  That was NBC's Stephanie Goss reporting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=179.06s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC law enforcement analyst and a former member of President Obama's task [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  force on 21st century policing, Cedric Alexander. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=187.56s)]
*  Good morning, Cedric. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=191.38s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=192.38s)]
*  So let's start with that building. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=193.38s)]
*  In your analysis as to why it was not considered part of the security perimeter, why there [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=197.14s)]
*  were no snipers there, and how it seemingly slipped through the cracks despite what was [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  a clear shot at the rally stage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=207.14s)]
*  Well, I think it's pretty clear now, Jonathan. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  It certainly was a security failure on the part, unfortunately, it appears to be of the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  Secret Service here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=220.26s)]
*  When you're going to have a former president or president and you're responsible for their [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=223.54s)]
*  protection, you just can't say, well, my responsibility is only up to this many feet at this many [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=230.22s)]
*  yards. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=237.82s)]
*  You have the sole responsibility. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=238.82s)]
*  That's why you work closely with local law enforcement. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=240.54s)]
*  However, in this case, to say it was outside of their security perimeter, that's really [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=244.18s)]
*  not acceptable. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=249.98s)]
*  And I think that's becoming more and more evident every day. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=250.98s)]
*  So at this point, it's certainly easy to criticize the Secret Service in terms of what they should [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  have done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  I think it's also an opportunity now for the Secret Service and other agencies to compare [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  notes and look at it in terms of what we're going to have to do going forward. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  This was a failure of security. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=272.78s)]
*  This is just not acceptable. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=276.86s)]
*  So yeah, to that point, there seemed like there are a number of mistakes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=280.54s)]
*  The roof we just covered, but also that there was reporting of the gunman was acting suspiciously [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=284.62s)]
*  near the metal detectors to come into the event. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=289.7s)]
*  He wasn't confronted. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=292.38s)]
*  And then the fact that former President Trump was allowed to stand, it could be clearly [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=294.1s)]
*  visible after he had been wounded and then put into the, and then those moments here [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=299.54s)]
*  we're seeing here is that if there was a second gunman, they would have a clear shot then. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=304.3s)]
*  What are some of the lessons? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=309.06s)]
*  What changes do you think could come to these rallies going forward in the wake of this? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=310.06s)]
*  Well, I think certainly going back, if you and I and Jonathan were in charge of a detail [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=315.38s)]
*  such as this, we're going to make sure that we're going to go beyond 100, 200-yard security [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=320.82s)]
*  perimeter, particularly if you have rifles that you can put out as far as a third thousand [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=327.41999999999996s)]
*  yards better. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=332.34s)]
*  And I think it becomes important to look at that, particularly in this climate that we're [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=335.5s)]
*  in. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=340.58s)]
*  And in addition to that, even at the point the shots were fired, the former president [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=341.58s)]
*  went down to cover himself of the immediate response of the Secret Service, making sure [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=347.34s)]
*  that we kept him covered hands down, head down, because he is the target. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=354.74s)]
*  So I think there's a lot to be learned from this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=362.98s)]
*  And I think the way forward now is to be able for them to be able to compare notes with [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=367.22s)]
*  their training and look at what they can do better going forward. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  So this is a sad, unfortunate, and it should not have happened under any condition. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=378.14000000000004s)]
*  But it's an opportunity for them to learn from it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so many questions about what went wrong and real scrutiny and pressure on the Secret [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  Service at this moment. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwaqYlj0tMc&t=391.9s)]
