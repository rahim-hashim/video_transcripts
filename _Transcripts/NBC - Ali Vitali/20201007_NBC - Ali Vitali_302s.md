# Rev. Warnock Now Frontrunner In Ga. Special Senate Election | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk)
*  Welcome back. The latest poll of the special Senate election in the now competitive state [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=0.0s)]
*  of Georgia shows the senior pastor from the famous Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  pulling ahead. Reverend Raphael Warnock, the local activist with national backing, is eight [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=11.66s)]
*  points in front of current Senator Kelly Loeffler. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, Warnock comes [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=16.96s)]
*  in at 31% in a field of five candidates, riding a wave of endorsements that include former [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=22.94s)]
*  presidents Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter. And joining us now is Democratic candidate [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=28.66s)]
*  for the U.S. Senate in the state of Georgia, Reverend Raphael Warnock. Reverend, thank [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=33.78s)]
*  you so much for getting up so early with us. It's great to see you again. This poll and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  your race, obviously a little different because it is a runoff, so no one likely to get 50% [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=44.38s)]
*  here. So we may not see a resolution on election day the way people will be expecting in all [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  of the other races across the map. But talk to us about what you're seeing with all of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=54.5s)]
*  the news that's unfolded in the last couple of weeks, the president's debate performance [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=60.3s)]
*  and now his diagnosis with COVID-19. What are you hearing from particularly undecided [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=64.42s)]
*  voters, if you can find any, about how those developments are impacting their plans for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=71.78s)]
*  voting in November? Well, thank you so much, Casey. I don't mind at all. It's wonderful [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=77.5s)]
*  to be here with you this early in the morning. I have to tell you that being the front runner [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=83.3s)]
*  feels pretty good. And I think that people are responding to our message. I'm running [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=89.06s)]
*  against the wealthiest member of Congress. She's poured millions of dollars into this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=94.86s)]
*  race. But thankfully, in our democracy, this seat is not for sale. And so as I'm moving [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=100.66s)]
*  across the state of Georgia, I was down in Valdosta, down in Brumswick, Augusta. People [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=106.78s)]
*  are really focused on themselves. I think too often politics is focused on the politicians, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=113.78s)]
*  who's up and who's down. But the folk who are trying to just work it out, sitting around [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=120.42s)]
*  their kitchen tables this morning, having to deal with the high cost of prescription drugs [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=125.7s)]
*  because Big Pharma is sitting in the seat too often to power. Those who are trying to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=131.78s)]
*  figure out how to get their kids to school are dealing with basic kitchen table issues. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=137.3s)]
*  And they don't see that through the lens of Democrat and Republican, right and left, but [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=143.34s)]
*  right and wrong. And in this moral moment, they're looking for leadership. And I'm deeply [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=147.5s)]
*  honored to offer myself a service yet again. You bring up health care, and that's obviously [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=151.94s)]
*  something that we know is on voters' minds, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=159.06s)]
*  Senate is about to start confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett. Democrats have focused on a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=166.18s)]
*  case that could knock down the Affordable Care Act that the Supreme Court has set to hear just weeks [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=171.06s)]
*  after the election. And there are questions about what Democrats should do if they take back the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=176.02s)]
*  Senate to try and change the Supreme Court. If you were elected to the Senate, would you support [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=180.74s)]
*  adding justices to the Supreme Court? Well, I'm honored to be running. And as you can see, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=186.02s)]
*  we've got a great shot. I intend to win this seat, but I don't want to get ahead of myself. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=192.10000000000002s)]
*  I think it's really important that we hold Mitch McConnell to the McConnell standard. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=196.18s)]
*  I didn't think I'd ever be saying that about anything. But in this case, he needs to be [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=201.78s)]
*  consistent. He is the one who insisted that we should wait until the election, let the people [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=206.5s)]
*  weigh in, in 2016. And I think the onus is on him to prove what's the difference between 2016 and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=212.34s)]
*  2020. There should be no confirmation before there is an inauguration. And I would be holding the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=218.9s)]
*  line where I am in the Senate right now. The good news is if I can win outright, and I know we've [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=226.58s)]
*  got a ways to go, but you know you're talking to a pastor who preaches about the parting of the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=231.46s)]
*  Red Sea and the things that can happen, right? When we really put ourselves in the struggle. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=236.18s)]
*  I mean, stranger things have happened in 2020 also. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=242.5s)]
*  This is the year of strange things. Things can happen. And if I win outright on November 3rd, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=246.34s)]
*  because this is the special election, I would be seated immediately and could conceivably be there [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=253.38s)]
*  to weigh in on this. And you know, we're reminded just how important this is. There will be a hearing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=259.14s)]
*  on the Affordable Care Act a week after the election. The stakes could not be higher. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=264.82s)]
*  All right, Reverend Raphael Warnock, thank you very much, sir. We really appreciate it. And we [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=271.38s)]
*  will, of course, be following your race very closely in the weeks to come. We also welcome [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=275.86s)]
*  interviews with any other leading candidates in this race here on Way Too Early. Senator Lafler, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=281.14s)]
*  Congressman Collins, we're looking at you. Hey there, I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC. Thanks [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h47BLzutaDk&t=286.58s)]
