# Trump running out of time to secure $464M bond in civil fraud case
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak)
*  Donald Trump is now running out of time to secure an appeal bond for his civil fraud case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=0.0s)]
*  The former president has until just Monday to come up with the cash for the $464 million judgment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=5.84s)]
*  If Trump doesn't, New York State Attorney General Letitia James could start seizing his assets. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Trump's lawyers on Monday asked an appeals court to stop the collection proceedings [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=18.96s)]
*  because they have not found a bond company that's willing to back the former president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=23.52s)]
*  According to his lawyers, Trump would actually need to put up nearly $557 million worth of collateral. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=29.04s)]
*  That's over half a billion dollars. As the New York Times points out, most of Trump's wealth is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=35.04s)]
*  tied to his real estate assets, which bond companies will not accept as collateral. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=39.6s)]
*  Yesterday, Sear Fox business correspondent Charlie Gasparino explained why Trump's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=45.2s)]
*  billionaire friends have yet to help him out. What is behind their reluctance? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=52.32s)]
*  Well, it's as of now. So let's see. Are they afraid that they might not see it anytime soon, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=59.36s)]
*  the money even succeeds on appeal? Yeah, I mean, that's one thing. I mean, I think, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=64.72s)]
*  I don't want to speak for Bernie Marcus, that's for sure. But just generally, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=71.36s)]
*  Donald doesn't have a great record at paying back banks over the years. And Donald Trump, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=76.56s)]
*  so you can sort of surmise from that what you will. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=81.6s)]
*  So joining us now, MSNBC contributor, Charlie Sykes. Charlie, that seems like a pretty good [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=85.68s)]
*  train of thought. Give Trump some money. You won't see it again. So talk to us, though, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=92.16000000000001s)]
*  about just this moment here, perhaps the reluctance of Trump's billionaire friends, but also just [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  what this means that he is now facing potentially losing much of his fortune or business empire [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  as of Monday. Well, it's financially devastating to Donald Trump. And it's also devastating to his [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=108.72s)]
*  whole image, to that whole myth that he created that he was this billionaire and this successful [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=115.36s)]
*  businessman, which has always been questionable. But I would also just note how dangerous this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=120.64s)]
*  particular moment is, because as he becomes more desperate, who might he reach out to for the money? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=126.96s)]
*  The possibility, and Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, has raised the questions of the possible [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=136.48s)]
*  national security implications of all of this. We do need to know at the end of the day where [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=141.76s)]
*  this money comes from, what the strings are, and who the next president of the United States might [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=149.12s)]
*  be beholden to. Once again, Donald Trump is pushing the envelope, and we're faced with [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  circumstances for which there's no precedent. We don't know. Will it be the Saudis? Might it be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  Russian oligarchs? What shady, dark money might actually come out of the woodwork to bail Donald [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=165.76s)]
*  Trump out at his moment of need? We could be at the beginning of another rather remarkable chapter [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=173.28s)]
*  in the Trump saga. Yes, I mean, we'll need to follow closely. We certainly know how foreign [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=181.76s)]
*  governments have tried to financially influence Trump in the past. Charlie, of course, Trump is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=186.72s)]
*  not the only one in his orbit facing legal troubles. Peter Navarro, org to report to prison. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=191.68s)]
*  You've also been writing about Steve Bannon and some of the January 6th defendants. Why do those [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  cases stand out to you? Well, by the way, I find this whole January 6th story to be really quite [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=200.72s)]
*  extraordinary. You're interviewed a few minutes ago. When you think about the fact that we're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  talking about a criminal conspiracy being at the center of Donald Trump's campaign, and that Donald [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump has made this a feature of his campaign. And I do think that people ought to remember [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=217.12s)]
*  that we are talking particularly with the January 6th defendants. We are talking about some [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  individuals who attack and beat police officers, used bear spray against them, beat them with [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  flagpoles, beat them with batons and stolen shields. This was an act of tremendous violence. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=233.12s)]
*  Five or six people died that day. And yet Donald Trump, the leader of the party that once claimed [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=239.76s)]
*  to be the law and order party, has embraced these rioters, the people who attacked these officers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=246.0s)]
*  who were trying to defend the Capitol. And Donald Trump has embraced them and is promising to use [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=252.48s)]
*  his power to free them. And he is the one who has made this the centerpiece of his campaign. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=259.28s)]
*  And every once in a while, we're asked, why do you people keep talking about January 6th so much? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=264.4s)]
*  Why do you keep talking about it so often? Well, because Donald Trump keeps talking about it. And [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=269.92s)]
*  Donald Trump apparently is going to keep talking about this right through November, which is really [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=274.4s)]
*  extraordinary when you think about the way that he continues to make himself the center of the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  circle of criminality. There's no question. He's not running from January 6th. He's embracing it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=286.96s)]
*  So, Charlie, you mentioned the election. It is a binary contest now. Trump and Biden have this all [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=291.84s)]
*  but sewn up. I just want to get your big picture thoughts as to where things stand in the race [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=296.88s)]
*  right now. President Biden did not receive a bump in the approval ratings after the State of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=301.76s)]
*  Union, but he did, I think, reassure Democrats who were anxious about his candidacy. He also has a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=306.88s)]
*  huge fundraising advantage over Trump. Trump up in the polls, but just a little. It's a close race. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=312.08s)]
*  Where do you think things stand? It's a very, very close race. And Biden may not have gotten a bump, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=317.84s)]
*  but he certainly changed the mood and he changed the narrative with that State of the Union address, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  which is not insignificant. But also, I think what we're seeing is that reports of Republican [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=329.2s)]
*  unity have been greatly exaggerated. You look at the numbers from last night, you have 20 percent [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=334.32s)]
*  of Republican primary voters who are telling the ex-opposters that they are not going to vote for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=339.52s)]
*  Donald Trump. They'll either vote for Joe Biden or they will sit it out. And so I do think that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  there are, you know, there are concerns. And of course, then of course, and I think that there [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=350.88s)]
*  are some people who don't really understand what a big deal the endorse, the non-endorsement by [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=355.52s)]
*  Mike Pence was, the signal that it sends to other Republicans. Look, you do not have to put a party [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=360.32s)]
*  in Donald Trump ahead of country. You do not necessarily need to go along with all of this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=367.68s)]
*  And I'm really interested to see how this all plays out. You know, as you mentioned, it's a binary [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=374.24s)]
*  choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. But for many Republican voters, it's also a binary choice, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=378.56s)]
*  Trump or not Trump. And I think that you're going to see that play out throughout the rest of the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=384.72s)]
*  year. Yeah, it can't be overstated the importance of his former vice president saying he won't [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  endorse him. Let's see if Nikki Haley, his last remaining Republican rival, does the same. MSNBC [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  contributor Charlie Sykes, thank you as always. We will speak to you again soon. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEVu7VNzOak&t=414.72s)]
