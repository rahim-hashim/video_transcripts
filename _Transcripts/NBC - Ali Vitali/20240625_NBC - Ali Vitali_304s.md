# The presidential debates that changed history
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU)
*  I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=0.0s)]
*  my opponent's youth and inexperience. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=8.88s)]
*  That was a moment during the 1984 presidential debates when Ronald Reagan was asked if at [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=15.32s)]
*  73 he was too old to be president. As you can see, Reagan's answer even got a laugh [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=20.16s)]
*  from his Democratic opponent, Walter Montiel. Joining us now, author and NBC News presidential [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=25.44s)]
*  historian Michael Beschloss. Michael, good to see you this morning. So let's just start [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  with the history here. How much do debates tend to matter? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=36.64s)]
*  Well there are three that changed history. 1960, John Kennedy showed that he was the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=43.44s)]
*  equal of the two-term vice president Richard Nixon and the momentum began to shift to Kennedy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=48.32s)]
*  1976, Gerald Ford made a terrible mistake saying that there was no Soviet domination [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=55.16s)]
*  of Eastern Europe. He meant something else, but people said, well, you know, Ford has [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=62.16s)]
*  been claiming he's the statesman superior of this one-term Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=66.64s)]
*  made it possible for Carter to be elected. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Number three, 1980, Reagan and Jimmy Carter debated 10 days before the election, only [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  Big undecided, a lot of them were women. The undecided voters were telling pollsters, we're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=82.96s)]
*  worried that Reagan is going to be a warmonger. Reagan came in and gave a studied performance, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=88.52s)]
*  looking charming, saying that he had a grandson. Last thing on earth he wanted to do was take [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=94.52s)]
*  the nation to war. People were relatively convinced. A huge amount of undecided voters [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  moved to Reagan, gave them a landslide. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  This debate is going to look very different than most. First of all, the commission on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=109.76s)]
*  presidential debates has been sidelined. There's not going to be an audience, it will just [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=113.68s)]
*  be the two men and the moderators. It's also going to be much earlier than normal and it's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=118.76s)]
*  between two men who each served four years in the White House. Give us your thoughts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=126.16s)]
*  as to what a unique moment this will be. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=130.28s)]
*  Yes, two people that we know very well. The question is whether this is going to be like [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=133.72s)]
*  the 1920 to date atmosphere between Trump and Joe Biden, which was acrimonious and loud. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=142.2s)]
*  I think the format probably prohibits that. It's very much like Nixon and Kennedy 1960 [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=151.44s)]
*  in a studio. No audience, no ability to grandstand. I think the big surprise is going to be the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=156.84s)]
*  rally Trump coming in bombastic or is it going to be more like almost his depositions on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=163.84s)]
*  video in which he actually sounds like a rather quiet, rational business person. Stay tuned. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=173.64s)]
*  The Trump team is already working the refs here the last few days, really accusing the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=181.44s)]
*  CNN anchors who are going to be moderating the debate of bias. We have seen Trump suggest [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  that Joe Biden should be drug tested. Give us your sense as to what are some things you're [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=191.64s)]
*  going to be looking for on Thursday as the audience watches this, where there may not [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=196.92s)]
*  be a lot of live fact checking and they're going to have to sift through probably an [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=202.2s)]
*  avalanche of lies. This is going to be really hard because Donald Trump is known for saying [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=207.04s)]
*  things that are not true at rallies and on TV, even in presidential addresses when he [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=213.23999999999998s)]
*  was president. So you're giving him an hour and a half of TV time, at least maximum, including [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=218.72s)]
*  the candidates and the moderators, that he can use to get out falsehoods, especially [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=225.04s)]
*  because he's going to have the last word. It's going to be a challenge for the moderators [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=230.52s)]
*  and Joe Biden not to let him get away and use that time, exploit it, to pump falsehoods [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=235.04s)]
*  into the public bloodstream. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=241.56s)]
*  And lastly and briefly, Michael, who do you think has more riding on Thursday night, Trump [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=243.96s)]
*  or Biden? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=249.12s)]
*  I think they both do because this is almost a tied election within the margin of error. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=250.12s)]
*  In the past, the distant past, you had one candidate coming in with a big margin wanting [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=257.0s)]
*  to hold onto his lead, nothing like that. So each of these candidates have a big incentive [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=262.56s)]
*  to try to use this first debate to move the needle. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=268.52s)]
*  All Eyes will be on Atlanta Thursday night. We of course, complete coverage here on MSNBC [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=272.04s)]
*  author and NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss. Thank you so much. We'll [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=276.98s)]
*  speak to you again soon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EVywS1OzVU&t=280.8s)]
