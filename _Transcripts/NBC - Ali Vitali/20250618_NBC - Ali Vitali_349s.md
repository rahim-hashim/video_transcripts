# State lawmakers warn of lack of personal security
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4)
*  Welcome back. Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah has deleted posts on his personal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=0.0s)]
*  ex account about the attack on two Minnesota lawmakers after criticism from Democrats. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=5.96s)]
*  On Sunday morning, Lee posted a surveillance photo of the suspect, writing, this is what [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=11.0s)]
*  happens when Marxists don't get their way. Less than 30 minutes later, Lee posted more [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=14.84s)]
*  photos of the suspect with the caption, nightmare on wall street, a reference to the Minnesota [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=19.6s)]
*  governor, but misspelling his name. Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, who was friends [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=23.68s)]
*  with one of the lawmakers killed in the attacks, confronted Lee Monday on Capitol Hill. You [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=28.779999999999998s)]
*  see them there face to face. Smith said yesterday that she was glad the posts were removed, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=33.3s)]
*  but added she hasn't heard Lee explain why he took him down or received an apology from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=37.66s)]
*  him. And in the wake of that politically motivated attack, some legislators are raising concerns [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=42.46s)]
*  about the lack of security. No state provides proactive protection for local legislators [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  outside of the state Capitol building, and multiple state representatives have spoken [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=52.9s)]
*  out hoping for that to change. According to NBC News to date, at least a half a dozen [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=56.72s)]
*  public officials who may run for president in 2028 have either personally faced political [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=61.72s)]
*  violence, lost friends in such plots, or had to manage political unrest in their states. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=66.52s)]
*  It's a stunning, stunning line. Joining us now, executive director of Giffords, Emma [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=72.2s)]
*  Brown. Giffords is an organization dedicated to saving lives from gun violence, stemming, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  of course, from the shooting attack on Gabby Giffords in 2011. Emma, thanks for joining [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=81.8s)]
*  us. You see that state legislators are speaking out there after the shooting in Minnesota. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=87.0s)]
*  There's that stunning line in our NBC story about the number of lawmakers who have been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=91.96s)]
*  involved or impacted by this kind of political violence. What's your assessment of the political [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=97.44s)]
*  landscape right now when it comes to this? Well, thanks so much for having me, Ali. I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=103.08s)]
*  just want to start with the fact that what we saw this past weekend in Minnesota was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=109.08s)]
*  devastating, and it's been a very hard week for this country. No one should ever be targeted [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  for political service, but unfortunately, that is something that we are seeing increasingly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=118.6s)]
*  in the United States. The reality is everybody knew Melissa Hartman and her husband. She [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=122.64s)]
*  was a remarkable public servant. You heard Governor Walz referring to her as the most [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=129.12s)]
*  consequential speaker in history. You hear testimonies pouring out from lawmakers who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=134.84s)]
*  knew and loved her. She was hunted and murdered in her home, and Senator John Hoffman and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=140.68s)]
*  his wife are very loved. They were shot and attacked as well. They are recovering, but [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=146.88s)]
*  they were shot eight and nine times, respectively. So you talked about Mike Lee's tweets earlier. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=151.52s)]
*  They were awful. They weren't just thoughtless, as some have said. They were intentionally [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=158.2s)]
*  and we are glad that they have come down, of course, but the fact that he wrote them and left [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=163.08s)]
*  them up in the first place tells you everything that you need to know. And I think what you're [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=166.6s)]
*  hearing from people across the board right now is that political violence is unacceptable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  Yes, that is true, but the problem is that it is becoming acceptable, right? When our leaders [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  fan the flames of hate and division for political gain, when our laws make it easy for anyone, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=181.96s)]
*  dangerous or not, to get a gun and hunt legislators, we have a really significant [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=188.2s)]
*  problem in this country. So that's what I think you're seeing right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=193.32s)]
*  Yeah, because in my conversations with lawmakers, everyone has agreed we need to take the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=196.44s)]
*  temperature down. This is a bipartisan problem that we are seeing. But is it enough to just say [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  that or does your organization have concrete recommendations on how this country can actually [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=208.04s)]
*  do that? Yeah, well, I think that you're pointing something out that's really important, which is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  whenever this happens, everyone will say, we have to take the temperature down. We have to take the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=218.28s)]
*  temperature down. And then, of course, we're up here again, and the president is stoking division. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  I would also say that that's half of the equation. The other half is that Americans are scared, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=229.0s)]
*  knowing that virtually anybody, from violent extremists to abusive partners to drug traffickers, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=235.56s)]
*  can easily assemble a stockpile of AK-47s and use them to target and kill people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=243.24s)]
*  I think it's important for folks to know that this person was driving around with three AK-47s [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  and a list of legislators. And regardless of how he got his guns—and we will learn more about that, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=256.04s)]
*  certainly in the coming days and weeks—we have to ask ourselves how that happened. So when we [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=261.8s)]
*  think about what the solutions to this are, it is certainly dialing back the rhetoric on both sides, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=266.36s)]
*  but I would say particularly from the president, who really seeks division and hate to further his [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=271.96s)]
*  agenda. And then secondly, we have to make it harder for dangerous people and criminals and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=278.28s)]
*  folks who are spiraling out of control to get weapons. There are many solutions to that problem— [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=283.56s)]
*  universal background checks, federal red flag law, safe storage laws. We know when those solutions [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  are implemented, fewer people are dying. And so it is a problem, you're right, for lawmakers on [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=295.88s)]
*  both sides of the aisle now. Yeah, I think that's right. And I also think that you're correct in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=301.48s)]
*  pointing out that the common thread in a lot of these situations is access to guns. I know that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=305.8s)]
*  there's a provision, for example, in the reconciliation bill that deals with gun silencers [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=311.88s)]
*  that has been controversial. We will have you back to talk about that as that legislation continues [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  to move. But for now, it's an important conversation. Emma Brown, thank you for coming on and having it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=322.44s)]
*  with us. Thanks for having me. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=327.24s)]
*  you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSF_JHJ9EC4&t=331.48s)]
