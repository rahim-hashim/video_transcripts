# BREAKING Biden commutes roughly 1,500 sentences
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc)
*  President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=0.0s)]
*  from prison and placed on home confinement during the COVID pandemic. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=5.3s)]
*  According to a statement just released by the White House, those whose sentences were [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=10.5s)]
*  commuted have successfully reintegrated into their families and have shown they deserve [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=14.1s)]
*  a second chance. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=20.34s)]
*  The president is also pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=21.86s)]
*  This is the largest single day act of clemency in modern history. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=26.62s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC contributor Mike Barnacle. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=31.3s)]
*  Mike thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=34.96s)]
*  There has been a lot of talk about how President Biden has used the pardon power in the wake [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  of the decision to release, to issue a pardon to his own son, Hunter Biden, after saying [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=41.86s)]
*  initially that he wouldn't. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=47.18s)]
*  We think we still have Mike there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=49.32s)]
*  The camera sort of went away. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=50.6s)]
*  But we hope he's there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=52.36s)]
*  Mike is still there, thank God. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=53.56s)]
*  Mike, we're glad you're alright. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=55.46s)]
*  Let's get your way in on these pardons. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=56.739999999999995s)]
*  There have been some calls from the left for President Biden to use his pardon more, pardon [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=59.14s)]
*  power more. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  He did so today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=64.24s)]
*  He still has a month or more in office. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  Would you anticipate that this will be the first of many of these kind of proclamations? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=67.5s)]
*  Well, he indicates that there are more to come, Jonathan. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=72.06s)]
*  He has indicated that in the statement released this morning from the White House. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=75.18s)]
*  1,500 people who were on home confinement, that's a stunning number actually. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=79.38s)]
*  We don't know what crimes they were convicted of. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=84.28s)]
*  They initially, apparently from the statement, did some prison time and are now going to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=86.36s)]
*  be pardoned and released from home confinement. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=91.4s)]
*  So that's a lot of people, a lot of pardons. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  More to come, clemency. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=97.36s)]
*  And as the President said, this is kind of who the President is. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=98.36s)]
*  America is built on second chances. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=101.56s)]
*  Well, he's right about that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to find out more, I guess, later today and certainly in the future as [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  he indicated more clemencies and more pardons. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=109.2s)]
*  Yeah, and this comes as even one of his top aides, Nia Don yesterday, criticized his decision [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=112.54s)]
*  to issue the pardon of Hunter after saying for so long that he wouldn't. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMih7-91Tc&t=117.30000000000001s)]
