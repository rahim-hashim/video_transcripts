# Trump hosting Saudi-backed LIV Golf tourney Friday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700)
*  Despite constantly complaining that it's his court appearances that are keeping him off [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=0.0s)]
*  the campaign trail, Donald Trump is set to host another golf tournament this weekend, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  this one for a league funded by the Saudi Arabian government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=9.38s)]
*  At Trump Doral in Miami, Florida, amateurs and professionals will tee off later today [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=13.0s)]
*  for a live golf event. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=17.32s)]
*  It comes as questions persist about conflicts of interest regarding Trump's political and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=19.3s)]
*  business relationships with Saudi Arabia, which just happens to be where he made his [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=24.98s)]
*  first foreign trip as president to Riyadh. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=29.4s)]
*  According to the New York Times, Trump also recently spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=32.56s)]
*  bin Salman, MBS, for reasons that are not yet clear. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  And the same wealth fund that is bankrolling live golf also gave $2 billion to an investment [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=41.7s)]
*  firm run by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, just months after the family left the White [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=47.0s)]
*  House. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=51.739999999999995s)]
*  Joining us now, conservative commentator and MSNBC contributor, Charlie Sykes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  Good morning, Charlie. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=59.16s)]
*  So just give us your impressions here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=60.96s)]
*  How concerned should Americans be about the nature of Donald Trump's relationship with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=62.8s)]
*  the Saudi government? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=67.48s)]
*  This comes at a time where he, of course, has been accused and charged with mishandling [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=69.32s)]
*  classified information, as well as a moment where the man could use some money and the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=73.66s)]
*  Saudi Crown Prince has lots of it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=78.68s)]
*  Well this whole story is a reminder, you know, that behind all of the dictator for one day [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=82.2s)]
*  and all the felonies, there's always the grift. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=86.92s)]
*  It's always about money for Donald Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=89.04s)]
*  And this story has three elements that I think are really fascinating. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=91.4s)]
*  I mean, number one, his hotel business is tanking. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  He's increasingly dependent on his golf business, and the golf business is increasingly dependent [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=98.12s)]
*  on people like the Saudis. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=104.16s)]
*  And to your point, the more Donald Trump gets pushed in the corner, the more he is likely [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=106.56s)]
*  to reach out to his foreign buddies, the ties with Saudi Arabia being the most dramatic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  So how concerned ought we to be? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=119.78s)]
*  You know, very concerned, especially this conversation that he had with MBS. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  Look, the Biden administration is working on a Mideast peace deal, and Donald Trump [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=127.1s)]
*  may be opening a back channel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=131.5s)]
*  And of course, Jared Kushner may be opening a back channel that is financial as well as [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=133.74s)]
*  political. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=138.62s)]
*  With Donald Trump, you just simply cannot disentangle his business conflicts from everything [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=139.78s)]
*  else. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=146.22s)]
*  And so, yes, I think people ought to be alarmed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=147.22s)]
*  I think people ought to be concerned about his relationship with the governments of China, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=149.98s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin, with Viktor Orban, and of course with MBS, who, by the way, let's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=154.98s)]
*  remind our listeners, is actually a murderer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=159.7s)]
*  He actually, you know, killed an American citizen and unfortunately appears to be getting [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=163.14s)]
*  away with it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=169.14s)]
*  Yeah, the U.S. intelligence believes MBS ordered the killing of Washington Post columnist [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=170.14s)]
*  Jamal Khashoggi a few years ago, and for which he was not condemned by then President Trump. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=173.94s)]
*  So let's talk about it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=180.05999999999997s)]
*  It's not just Americans who are concerned. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=181.05999999999997s)]
*  Certainly the world is watching Donald Trump here now, just a few months from the election, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=182.05999999999997s)]
*  where he could, he stands about a one in two chance of being president again. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=186.61999999999998s)]
*  We're seeing NATO take steps to try to create a fund for Ukraine that Trump couldn't touch. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  We're seeing concerns about policies he might have towards China, other places. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=196.5s)]
*  Talk to us about how the world is watching this election right now, Charlie. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=200.94s)]
*  Well, the world is alarmed and they ought to be alarmed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=204.66s)]
*  We just had the 75th anniversary of NATO and I think NATO is realizing that the clock is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=208.38s)]
*  running. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=214.54s)]
*  The clock is running on American leadership in the world. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=215.78s)]
*  It's hard to overstate what it would mean for the global situation if somebody like [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=220.02s)]
*  Donald Trump gets into office. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=226.5s)]
*  I mean, a green light for Vladimir Putin, maybe a green light for China with Taiwan, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=228.66s)]
*  maybe the end of NATO as a cohesive unit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=233.78s)]
*  So they are deeply alarmed and I think they have every reason to be. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  So Charlie, we're about seven months, almost exactly, from the election. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=244.02s)]
*  There's a lot on President Biden's plate right now with the situation in Gaza now being very [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=248.66s)]
*  much at the forefront, this tough language and this phone call yesterday with Prime [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=253.62s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=256.5s)]
*  What are some of the things that he needs to do, both domestically and in foreign policy [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=257.98s)]
*  that will help him win re-election? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=262.98s)]
*  Well he's got to somehow fix the policy with Israel and Gaza because what he's been doing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=266.86s)]
*  so far apparently has not been working. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=273.3s)]
*  He's been trying to pressure Benjamin Netanyahu, who apparently is not listening, and Netanyahu [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  has a long history of doubling down with his policies. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=283.14s)]
*  So he's got to resolve many of those things. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=288.9s)]
*  But again, he's going to have to prosecute the case against Donald Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=291.62s)]
*  He's also going to have to continue to show that he is up to the job. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  It's interesting that the narrative has shifted away from some of the hand-wringing from earlier [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=299.9s)]
*  this year. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=308.26s)]
*  I think he's got a lot about his age and about his capacity and everything. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=309.98s)]
*  But I think he's got a long way to go to be able to do that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  However, I do think that some of the polling would suggest that more and more Americans [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=317.18s)]
*  are coming to grips with something I think they've been in denial about, that this was [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=322.42s)]
*  going to be a rerun of Biden versus Trump. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  They didn't want that rerun, but that's what they're going to get. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  That's what they're going to get. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=333.06s)]
*  And now we'll have to see how Americans feel about that choice now that it is right in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=334.06s)]
*  front of them. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8s4aMS2700&t=339.4s)]
