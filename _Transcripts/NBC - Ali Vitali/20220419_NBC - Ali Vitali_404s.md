# TSA Will No Longer Enforce Mask Mandate
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE)
*  Travelers are no longer required to wear masks on public transportation after a federal judge overturned the mandate, calling it unlawful. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=0.0s)]
*  The judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the CDC overstepped its authority when it opposed the mask mandate. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=11.0s)]
*  The ruling led to an immediate policy change on planes, trains, buses, and other modes of transportation. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=19.0s)]
*  Some passengers were allowed to take masks off mid-flight and of course, then posted those videos to social media. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=25.0s)]
*  This decision comes less than a week after the CDC had extended the mandate for 15 days to combat the current rise in COVID cases. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=55.0s)]
*  It was set to expire early next month. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=74.0s)]
*  The White House is still urging riders to keep masks on for now, saying no decision has been made about whether to appeal the ruling. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=77.0s)]
*  This is obviously a disappointing decision. The CDC continues recommending wearing a mask in public transit. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=85.0s)]
*  As you know, this just came out this afternoon, so right now the Department of Homeland Security, who would be implementing, and the CDC are reviewing the decision. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=92.0s)]
*  And of course, the Department of Justice would make any determinations about litigation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=99.0s)]
*  Joining us now, White House Deputy Press Secretary Chris Maher. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=105.0s)]
*  Chris, thanks for being with us again today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=109.0s)]
*  We just heard from Jen saying that the Department of Justice could look into potential litigation about the end of this mask mandate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=111.0s)]
*  Walk us through possible next steps. The mandate was going to expire in a couple weeks anyway. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=120.0s)]
*  Is it possible this goes to court? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, good to be with you, Jonathan. And you're exactly right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=130.0s)]
*  The CDC last week said it needed a couple more weeks to review this masking order. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=133.0s)]
*  They're going to take another look at the newest and latest science and data that was available to see how people could travel most safely around the country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=139.0s)]
*  We're in the middle of reviewing the judge's decision. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=150.0s)]
*  That's agencies within the federal government. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=155.0s)]
*  And ultimately, it'll be a decision from the DOJ on whether to appeal or what the next steps might be legally. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=158.0s)]
*  But as you heard and as you've kind of talked about earlier in the show, you know, CDC still recommends that people mask during indoor public transportation settings. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=165.0s)]
*  And we encourage people to if they want, if they feel comfortable to continue to follow those CDC recommendations to mask. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=178.0s)]
*  And a quick follow up to that. Is there a particular concern about the decision considering we are seeing COVID cases rise in portions of the country right now? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=188.0s)]
*  Well, we've always said that we will follow the science and the data that we will listen to our doctors at the CDC who oversee these types of things. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=196.0s)]
*  And as we said, they're reviewing this order, they're reviewing the science and the data behind this order. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=207.0s)]
*  They'll continue to do that over over these next couple of weeks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=214.0s)]
*  And ultimately, it's a decision for the DOJ on whether to pursue this legally or not. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=218.0s)]
*  So, Chris, I've reported today that the White House is trying to sort of pivot back to some domestic issues. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=224.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, the war in Europe is still front of mind, but we've seen the president on the road last week. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=231.0s)]
*  He's going to the Pacific Northwest later this week, New Hampshire today to talk about infrastructure. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=237.0s)]
*  Tell us the thinking in there in the West Wing as to why the president needs to be talking about these issues that have impact Americans at home. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=242.0s)]
*  Well, you're exactly right. There's a lot going on in the world. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=253.0s)]
*  The president's obviously been very involved in making sure that the United States is supporting Ukraine and defend and their defense of their country from Putin's invasion. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=257.0s)]
*  But it's important to be talking about what's going on here at home as well and the impacts of that war in Ukraine. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=271.0s)]
*  You know, people are paying too much when they go to the gas station. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=278.0s)]
*  They're paying too much when they go to the grocery store. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=282.0s)]
*  And the president understands that and recognizes that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=284.0s)]
*  And that's why he's doing everything that he can across the board to try to lower prices for the American people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=287.0s)]
*  Part of that is talking about what we've done and how much economic progress we've made. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=294.0s)]
*  7.9 million jobs, a historic record, 3.6 percent unemployment rate, a place where economists didn't think we'd be for another couple of years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=298.0s)]
*  But we have more work to do. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=309.0s)]
*  That's why he's going to New Hampshire today to talk about the bipartisan infrastructure law that we passed and the money that's going to be going to our nation's ports. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=310.0s)]
*  The ports are a place of entry for a lot of goods that entered the United States. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=320.0s)]
*  And this infrastructure law will invest in our ports to to make sure that goods are getting from the ship to the shelf as quickly as possible and hopefully lower prices for the American people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=326.0s)]
*  Chris, very quickly, we're up against the time here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=339.0s)]
*  Speaking of Ukraine, has a decision been made yet about sending a U.S. delegation to Kiev? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=341.0s)]
*  We don't have any update for you there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=349.0s)]
*  The president continues to talk to President Zelenskyy on a regular occasion. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=352.0s)]
*  We continue to engage with our partners and allies around the world about how we can make sure that Ukraine has the resources they need to defend their country while also continuing to impose costs on Russia. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=356.0s)]
*  But I don't have any update for you on travel to Ukraine quite yet. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=371.0s)]
*  All right. Well, we appreciate that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=377.0s)]
*  White House Deputy Press Secretary Chris Maher, good to talk to you this morning. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=379.0s)]
*  We will speak to you again soon. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oS4rCV9PzE&t=382.0s)]
