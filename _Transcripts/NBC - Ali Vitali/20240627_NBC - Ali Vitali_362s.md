# Biden campaign gets an early start on fact-checking Trump in the debate
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY)
*  Meanwhile, the Biden campaign is getting an early start on fact-checking former President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump ahead of tonight's debate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=4.5s)]
*  According to a memo shared with NBC News, the campaign has set up a rapid response strategy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=6.84s)]
*  and has already outlined the lies, misstatements, and exaggerations it believes Trump is most [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=11.92s)]
*  likely to say on the debate stage tonight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=17.84s)]
*  Biden's campaign is focusing on seven key topic areas they expect to come up during [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  the debate, which include abortion, crime, the economy, immigration, entitlements such [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=25.32s)]
*  as Social Security and Medicare, foreign policy, and Trump's false claims that he won the 2020 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=30.08s)]
*  election. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=35.84s)]
*  The president's allies also plan to send out fact checks during the debate through emails [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=36.84s)]
*  and on social media. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  So let's turn again to Sam Stein. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=43.72s)]
*  And Sam, you've proven to be an expert on incoming French NBA players, but let's do [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=46.56s)]
*  some politics now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=51.32s)]
*  The Biden campaign has been very frustrated at times trying to break through the noise, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=54.18s)]
*  to break through a fractured media environment and actually get their message out. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=60.42s)]
*  You said it earlier on the show, and I think it's exactly right. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=65.88s)]
*  It's all about contrasts. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=67.62s)]
*  Talk to us about the opportunity here and whether this fact-checking effort makes sense [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=69.58s)]
*  for what the Biden team wants to do. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=73.82000000000001s)]
*  It's tough, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=77.18s)]
*  We wrote about this at Politico, but fact-checking Trump is very difficult, if not impossible. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=79.26s)]
*  The man lies a lot, and he meanders. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  And multiple moderators and interviewers have tried to do it in real time. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=89.5s)]
*  Some have done it successfully and some have not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=94.7s)]
*  But that's part of Trump's strategy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=97.7s)]
*  He just bulldozes. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  And so the question confronting the Biden people is, OK, well, to what degree do we [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=100.76s)]
*  use our time on the debate stage and the time outside of the debate stage where we're trying [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=106.7s)]
*  to spin what happened on the debate stage to fact-check? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=109.96s)]
*  There was some frustration within the Biden camp that CNN had said that the job of the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=113.36s)]
*  moderators were not to necessarily do real-time fact-checking. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=119.89999999999999s)]
*  But that raises the question of what responsibility the Biden operation itself has to do it for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=130.06s)]
*  And I think every—you know, it's—I don't have the correct answer here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=131.06s)]
*  I think they want to create a contrast. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=134.2s)]
*  Is the best way to do it by saying, no, that's a lie, or no, you're misleading? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=136.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  I will note there is a historical thing to—a precedent to think about here in how they're [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=140.83999999999997s)]
*  approaching debate prep. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=145.44s)]
*  Twenty-twenty—2012, Obama, first debate against Romney. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=146.44s)]
*  He comes out probably a little bit overconfident. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=150.14s)]
*  But what the Obama camp did not anticipate was that Romney was going to basically adopt [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=153.28s)]
*  policy prescriptions than what they had been running on to that point and basically, you [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=161.44s)]
*  know, move away from the attacks that Obama had lodged on him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=166.04s)]
*  Obama was not ready to do real-time pushback in that sense. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=169.96s)]
*  I do wonder if the people who did prep for that 2012 debate, who are involved in this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=172.88s)]
*  2024 debate, look back at the experience and are preparing for something similar to happen [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=177.0s)]
*  tonight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=181.0s)]
*  You're also right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=182.0s)]
*  It's a truism that incumbents tend to be rusty and maybe don't perform well at the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=183.0s)]
*  first debate because they haven't been challenged in so long. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=188.12s)]
*  But that applies to Trump, too, who skipped all the Republican primary debates and doesn't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=191.52s)]
*  exactly sit for contentious interviews. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  Sam, let's talk about Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=197.52s)]
*  We mentioned earlier on the show he's teasing that his VP, whoever that might be, will be [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=200.28s)]
*  here tonight in Atlanta. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  And there had been some suggestion that he was going to announce his pick just before [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=206.68s)]
*  the Republican convention in Milwaukee in a few weeks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=210.52s)]
*  Now that timetable might be moving up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=212.68s)]
*  You give it just for the viewers here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=214.92s)]
*  Lay out the candidates and also what is Trump looking for in a VP? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=217.72s)]
*  And frankly, does it even matter? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=221.72s)]
*  Well, first and foremost, Trump bringing the VP tonight would be kind of weird unless he [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=224.11999999999998s)]
*  is nervous about having a bad night, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  You use that VP to win a new cycle, to gain some momentum, to change the script. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=234.44s)]
*  And so if he has a bad night, I would expect some announcement pretty soon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=240.04s)]
*  But a debut right before the debate would be to step on the announcement. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  It wouldn't make any sense. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=245.72s)]
*  Doesn't mean he won't do it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=246.72s)]
*  He has a well-known history of bringing surprise guests to debates. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's something to consider. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  In terms of the candidates, the main ones that we know of are Doug Burgum, Marco Rubio, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  JD Vance, right? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=260.72s)]
*  Obviously, there's others, and it possibly goes outside that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=261.72s)]
*  But in each case, it's either a senator or a governor, someone who ostensibly could run [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  out the ticket in certain ways. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  But I'm with you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=273.2s)]
*  I think I'm with you because it was implicit in your question. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=274.2s)]
*  I don't know how much it actually matters here, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=276.76s)]
*  Like Marco Rubio is not going to win you Florida. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=278.84s)]
*  I don't think we really care about North Dakota all that much. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=280.64s)]
*  Don't really think you care about Ohio all that much. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=283.24s)]
*  I think JD Vance is an interesting one if you want to appeal to some sort of economic [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=286.24s)]
*  populist messaging. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  It's kind of a new type of foreign policy that's very Trump-focused, which is not a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=291.76s)]
*  lot of international engagement, in fact, outright skepticism of international engagement. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=297.2s)]
*  Marco Rubio wouldn't really fit in that category, but he's contorting himself already. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  And then Doug Burgum is just sort of a—you know, he's a Doug. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=306.92s)]
*  He's a bland white governor, business guy, really wouldn't upstage Trump. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that's basically the idea, is you don't upstage Trump, but he would give you [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=314.52000000000004s)]
*  the veneer of normalcy, which I suppose is something that Trump people do want to project. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  I think we'll get some clues about where Trump's head's at tonight at the debate, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  but I really would be surprised if we actually get the announcement tonight before the debate. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=327.08s)]
*  Some trenchant political analysis there. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=332.12s)]
*  He's a Doug. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=334.12s)]
*  He's a Doug. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=335.12s)]
*  Sam Stein, thank you so much for helping us out this morning. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=336.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=337.64s)]
*  And we'll talk to you again just a little bit later on. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=338.64s)]
*  Morning, Joe. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30H9qMZtCdY&t=339.64s)]
