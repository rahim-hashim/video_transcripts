# Trump says he intends to testify in hush money trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs)
*  In just hours now, jury selection is set to begin in Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=0.0s)]
*  It needs to be repeated. It's the first time in U.S. history that a former president will be on trial for criminal charges. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=7.2s)]
*  Two sources with direct knowledge of the situation tell NBC News that 6,000 potential jurors will be subpoenaed to Manhattan Criminal Court this week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=14.9s)]
*  Usually, it's about 4,000 jurors are calling in a week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=24.6s)]
*  More than 1500 will be there today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=28.299999999999997s)]
*  Now, not all of the potential jurors, of course, are intended for the Trump trial, but the increase in numbers can be attributed to what's happening with the former president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=30.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, on Friday, Trump spoke to reporters during during a joint appearance with House Speaker Mike Johnson down at Mar-a-Lago, and Trump said he intends to testify at the trial. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=40.7s)]
*  I'm testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there's no case. They have no case. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=52.7s)]
*  Despite those comments, Trump's attorneys have yet to confirm or deny whether he'll take the stand. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=60.1s)]
*  Trump is accused of coordinating a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election to keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=65.9s)]
*  Trump was charged with falsifying documents to cover up that payment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=76.5s)]
*  He denies the charges and denies ever having sex with Daniels. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=81.5s)]
*  He spent the weekend on true social railing against the case. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  Unclear if he'll be holding his impromptu courtroom hallway news conferences. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  His attorneys don't want him to. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=93.4s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC Justice and Legal Affairs analyst Anthony Coley. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=96.2s)]
*  He was the chief spokesman at the DOJ under Attorney General Merrick Garland. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  Anthony, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  First, just just walk us through what we should expect to see today. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=107.9s)]
*  How does this jury selection process work? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=111.7s)]
*  How long is it going to take? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=114.5s)]
*  What are you looking out for? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=115.9s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=118.2s)]
*  Let me just start by saying this is a big day for Donald Trump, but it feels bigger than that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=118.9s)]
*  It feels like this moment that we've had like a season shift and that we're now in a season of accountability for Donald Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=123.4s)]
*  I think back, Jonathan, to January this year where he was found liable for assaulting, defaming, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  E.J. Carroll. He owes her 90 million dollars. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=137.89999999999998s)]
*  In February of this year, he was found liable for fraudulent business activity. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=140.2s)]
*  He owes the people of New York 500 million dollars. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  And then today, he is facing criminal prosecution for his efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  So it feels, Jonathan, like the legal walls are starting to close in on Donald Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=155.0s)]
*  In terms of the jury selection today, he has one goal, and that is to identify one or two potential jurors, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=159.7s)]
*  one or two potential jurors who can say not guilty when this case reaches the deliberation phase of the process. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=168.7s)]
*  So I am looking for him to try to see how he uses this process and also his physical presence in the courtroom to get that type of jury pool. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=176.6s)]
*  Do you think he actually will testify? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=188.1s)]
*  And if he does, does that do him more harm or good in your estimation? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=190.4s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine that his lawyers are advising him to testify because Trump's allegiance to the fidelity to the truth, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=194.4s)]
*  I think we all know he's lacking in that regard. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=201.5s)]
*  So I don't imagine if his lawyers have anything to do with it that he's going to take the stand. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=205.0s)]
*  But you know, one thing we have seen from Donald Trump, he makes his own calls. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  And lastly, and very briefly, as this begins today, were he to be convicted? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=216.6s)]
*  No sure thing, and it could be weeks from now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=220.6s)]
*  What sort of sentence could he face? Could he actually be incarcerated? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=222.6s)]
*  Yeah, he absolutely could be incarcerated. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=226.1s)]
*  I think this is a decision that will ultimately come down to the judge, which is why it is a little bit wildering [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=228.6s)]
*  if you step back and think about all of the ways he is antagonizing Judge Marchand with these social media posts [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=237.6s)]
*  when ultimately assuming as he faces a jury of his pills and of his peers, and if they find him guilty, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=245.1s)]
*  then the ultimate sentence is going to come down to Judge Juan Marchand. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=253.1s)]
*  And you would think he would not want to antagonize a person that could either sentence him to jail or just sentence him to probation. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=257.1s)]
*  We will of course have complete coverage of this on Morning Joe and all day long on MSNBC, the historic trial of Donald J. Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=265.1s)]
*  MSNBC Justice and Legal Affairs Analyst Anthony Coley, thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=273.1s)]
*  And enjoy it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aijQLLzQDs&t=303.1s)]
