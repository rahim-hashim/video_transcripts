# Harris gives message to supporters in first remarks since concession
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=0.0s)]
*  Walz, held a final video call yesterday with their campaigns, grassroots [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  volunteers and donors. Both Harris and Walz thanked everyone on the call for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  their hard work during the condensed whirlwind campaign, while also [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=11.6s)]
*  encouraging them to stay engaged in politics as Donald Trump prepares to re-enter the White House. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=15.92s)]
*  Let me just say to everyone on this call, I am so grateful for you [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=23.2s)]
*  and I'm so thankful to you. I'm thankful for your love of our country and your willingness [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  to put the work into it. And I know this is an uncertain time. I'm clear-eyed about that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=36.32s)]
*  I know you're clear-eyed about it. And it feels heavy. And I just have to remind you, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=42.96s)]
*  don't you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power that you did before [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=52.4s)]
*  November 5th. And you have the same purpose that you did. And you have the same ability [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=59.68s)]
*  to engage and inspire. Joining us now, staff writer at the Atlantic, Mark Leibovich. Mark, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  good to see you. So your latest piece for the Atlantic is about these Democrats in defeat. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=77.12s)]
*  It has the headline, In Praise of Clarity. Explain, if you will, what clarity you think [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats should receive from the results of this month's election. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=88.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, to be clear, we're talking about numeric clarity. And look, I think over the last few [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=94.56s)]
*  weeks, there's been a bit of a revisionist history. And I think some of it has to do with the numbers [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=99.92s)]
*  coming in about how decisive this defeat was for them. I mean, I think it was decisive. I think in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=104.24s)]
*  some ways, the clarity of the popular vote loss is instructive and potentially helpful for them [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=110.8s)]
*  as far as having a real kind of discussion and a real kind of clear look about where they are and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=118.64s)]
*  where they're going forward. But also, just it doesn't have the muddle of, even in the case of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  2016, when Hillary Clinton was like, yeah, well, at least she won the popular vote or yeah, well, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=132.32s)]
*  if two votes in this state or in two counties or this or that went the other way. I mean, you still [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=138.48s)]
*  hear some of that. But ultimately, I think Democrats have been involved in, I think, a pretty [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=143.6s)]
*  rigorous and kind of maybe a five stages of grief kind of process where they're trying to figure out [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=149.84s)]
*  where this went wrong and where to go from it. And it could be pretty simple as maybe just finding a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=155.68s)]
*  good candidate or it could be something much deeper about how to win back working class voters. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=160.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's certainly a narrow defeat, but certainly more convincing than in 2016. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  Lots of questions for Democrats. So, Mark, you're one of the best chroniclers of Washington itself [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  and the culture of the Capitol. And you wrote about how Donald Trump, when he first came in, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  what a shock to the system he was to Washington. But now it's Act Two. How do you think that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=182.72s)]
*  Republicans there who were so subservient the first time around will behave this time? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=190.4s)]
*  And what sort of resistance, if any, can Democrats mount? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=195.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. It's a really key question we're all kind of asking here [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=199.36s)]
*  around Washington. I mean, to some degree, there is a principle at work, which is that when [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=203.36s)]
*  Republicans in the Trump era are going to be called upon to act sort of courageously as a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=208.8s)]
*  bulwark against his inclination to take as much power as possible, they will cave. They will do [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=213.92s)]
*  the less courageous thing. I mean, we've seen that time and time again with some exceptions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=222.64s)]
*  I do think in the last few weeks, there has been a pretty stepped up conversation about maybe [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=227.6s)]
*  Republicans in the Senate will be some kind of stopgap against what Donald Trump wants to do, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=234.0s)]
*  the instincts. And I think obviously, a lot of his nominees, I mean, I think when you think about, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=239.68s)]
*  I don't know if you call it the Big Four, the something four of Kennedy, Gabbard, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=245.12s)]
*  Gates, who is now no longer nominated, and Pete Hexs, being the Big Four, that at some point, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=250.16s)]
*  some group or gang or whatever you want to call it of Republicans will lack arms and actually be [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=257.92s)]
*  a real check because, look, this is a very unchecked and balanced potentially president. I mean, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=263.36s)]
*  he doesn't have a reelection to think about. He has all three chambers of the House and Senate. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  The courts obviously are not going to do that. His, what adults in the room don't seem to have [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=274.56s)]
*  a lot of adults. So we'll see. But I do think that that is where the potential is. And that is where [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=279.04s)]
*  sort of the drama is. We look to where some of this, where some of the donations go. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=284.16s)]
*  And Mark, in our last minute, what do you think Democrats will do? Like in 2016, there was real [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  anger, but also purpose. They rallied against the Trump administration, this time, at least so far, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=294.88s)]
*  real despondence. It's a very different feel. Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of it is just the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=299.36s)]
*  stunningness of the loss. And I also think that, I mean, right now it's all sort of been some [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=304.48s)]
*  muddle of the holidays, the kind of recriminations about what happened in the Harris campaign, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=310.4s)]
*  and also blame being cast about it, especially around Joe Biden and his last days. So I mean, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=317.2s)]
*  there's a lot going on. I do think at some point Democrats will find, I think, a more cohesive [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=322.16s)]
*  voice about this, probably when Donald Trump takes over and starts doing stuff. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=327.6s)]
*  Staff writer at the Atlantic, Mark Leavitch. Mark, thank you so much. We really appreciate it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=332.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlnHuEYDKU&t=352.16s)]
