# Kevin McCarthy says Trump needs to stop focusing on retribution
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA)
*  What President Trump needs to do in this campaign, it needs to be about rebuilding, restoring, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=0.0s)]
*  renewing America. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  It can't be about revenge. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  He's talking about retribution, day in, day out. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=9.02s)]
*  He needs to stop that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=12.42s)]
*  He needs to stop that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=13.42s)]
*  You think he's going to listen to you saying, stop that, stop that, stop that, anybody before? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=15.18s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=20.54s)]
*  He will adapt when he gets all the facts. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  He's not backing away from his calls for retribution. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=24.94s)]
*  Yeah, but remember, you have a check and balance system, and I think at the end of the day... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Where's the check and balance on him and the Republican Party? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=32.6s)]
*  America doesn't want to see the idea of retribution. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=35.04s)]
*  If it's rebuild, restore, and renew, I think he'll see that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=38.5s)]
*  And look, that's him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=42.52s)]
*  But I'm not going to change who I am, and I'm not going to stop giving him the advice, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=44.6s)]
*  and look, I lost the job as speaker. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=48.52s)]
*  Maybe I don't have the best advice. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  That's former Speaker of the House, now Congressman Kevin McCarthy, on former President Trump's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=52.98s)]
*  plans of retribution if he is re-elected. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  Seemingly somewhat delusional that Trump might listen to his or anyone else's advice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO4FSlwyrWA&t=61.98s)]
