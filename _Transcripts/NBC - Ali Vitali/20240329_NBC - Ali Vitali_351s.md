# Republicans slam Biden over federal funding for Key Bridge
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo)
*  The federal government is giving Maryland its first 60 million dollars towards cleaning up and rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=0.0s)]
*  Of course, that's the drop in the bucket for what will be needed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  The bridge collapsed earlier this week after a cargo ship struck it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=9.48s)]
*  A massive thousand ton crane is expected to arrive overnight to clear the river of mangled metal and containers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=13.24s)]
*  So far, two bodies have been recovered and four others are missing and presumed dead, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=20.28s)]
*  believed to be trapped in a vehicle beneath concrete steel that fell into the water. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=24.4s)]
*  Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott says he remains hopeful the rest of the bodies will eventually be recovered. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  This is Scott faces a new challenge on a different front. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Racist conspiracy theories surrounding the bridges collapse. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=39.32s)]
*  Some Republicans and right wing pundits are attempting to connect the tragedy to diversity, equity and inclusion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=43.0s)]
*  Here's how the mayor responded to those racist attacks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=50.04s)]
*  We know what they want to say, but they don't have the courage to say the N word. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  And the fact that I don't believe in their untruthful and wrong ideology and I am very proud, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=58.24s)]
*  proud of my heritage and who I am and where I come from scares them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=65.24s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst, Brandon Buck. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Brandon was a communications strategist and former aide to House Speaker Ryan Boehner. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=73.16s)]
*  So, Brandon, Republican Congressman Dan Muser weighed in on President Biden's promise to use federal funding [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  to replace that critical shipping artery in Baltimore to repair the bridge and the port. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=84.48s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=89.92s)]
*  It was kind of outrageous immediately for Biden to express in this tragedy the idea that he's going to use federal funds to pay for the entirety. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=92.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, he doesn't refer to it as the American taxpayer dollars on anything. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=102.44s)]
*  The first reaction, in fact, the only reaction just tends to be to spend. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=107.2s)]
*  So, Brandon has noted 60 million dollars on its way. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=112.12s)]
*  But this is a rebuilding price tag. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  It's going to be in the billions, most likely. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=116.68s)]
*  Am I wrong that when there have been other disasters like this, other bridge collapses, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  federal government moved in a bipartisan way and move swiftly? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  Talk to us about this very polarized rhetoric. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=128.16s)]
*  And should we expect to hear more of it from House Republicans? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=133.76s)]
*  In 2007, the bridge in Minnesota collapsed over the Mississippi, and Congress acted within a few days, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=134.4s)]
*  unanimously passing hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=140.12s)]
*  Look, I expect Congress is going to provide funding to rebuild the bridge. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  But this is a whole different era. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=148.52s)]
*  2007 feels like a million years ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  We've seen this repeatedly, whether it's not just a bridge collapse, but natural disasters. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=153.96s)]
*  You always end up having a lot of conservatives say, well, this doesn't need to be the federal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=159.16s)]
*  government's responsibility, or they push back, or they find some reason to say they [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=164.4s)]
*  shouldn't vote for it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=167.52s)]
*  And then when it happens in their neighborhood, they sound a little different. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=169.08s)]
*  There will absolutely be conservatives who push back on this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=172.6s)]
*  There does happen to be one member who will be, I think, relatively important. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=175.84s)]
*  Andy Harris of Maryland represents the Eastern Shore of Maryland. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=179.72s)]
*  He's a House Freedom Caucus member. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=182.6s)]
*  I think he will be an important voice for, or at least a liaison to the more conservatives in the House [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=184.32s)]
*  to get them along. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  But the shape of the deal is also, I think, going to be really interesting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=192.88s)]
*  We know this is not just a bridge collapse. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=196.2s)]
*  This is also going to be a significant economic disruption, not just to Maryland and Baltimore, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=198.44s)]
*  but the entire country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=204.48s)]
*  And I'll be interested to see whether the Biden administration requests some type of economic [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=205.56s)]
*  support for the city. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=210.24s)]
*  And that may get conservatives crossed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=212.04s)]
*  But I expect they'll be able to come together in a bipartisan way. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  The issue is just how much grief is Mike Johnson going to get from conservatives for, once again, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  spending more money? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  Such key points there about the Republican hypocrisy when the disaster is in their area. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=222.44s)]
*  And just a sad commentary about how polarized things are right now and how the House Republicans act. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=227.16s)]
*  Speaking of House Republicans acting out, Roger Taylor Green, as we know, about a week or so back, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=232.88s)]
*  began efforts to try to oust Speaker Johnson. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=237.44s)]
*  It's unclear exactly where that's going. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=240.2s)]
*  So give us your analysis. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=242.44s)]
*  Could this blow back on MTG? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=243.88s)]
*  Or could she have more help with news that Speaker Johnson is talking to President Zelensky [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=246.24s)]
*  and seems more apt to aid Ukraine? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, as we've discussed before, I mean, I think this is entirely about Ukraine. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=255.32s)]
*  She framed it as about the last spending bill, but I think she is trying to get ahead of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=259.44s)]
*  what Johnson has said is the next priority, which is funding for Ukraine. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=262.8s)]
*  Look, Johnson is being much more forward-leaning on this issue than I actually expected him [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=266.56s)]
*  to be. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=271.04s)]
*  He outright said that this is their next priority. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=272.28000000000003s)]
*  And if he wasn't serious about it, I don't know why he would say that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=274.8s)]
*  So I expect if Marjorie Taylor Green is going to try to make this motion, it will be around [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  Johnson trying to move money for Ukraine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=283.24s)]
*  And I do think it could completely blow up on her in that I find it very hard to see [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=285.36s)]
*  Democrats doing to Kevin McCarthy what they did or doing to Mike Johnson what they did [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=289.92s)]
*  to Kevin McCarthy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=294.8s)]
*  As we know, it only takes a few members, few Republicans to do this if all the Democrats [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  are voting with him. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=300.32000000000005s)]
*  If all the Democrats are not voting with him, then this could easily fail in this threat [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=301.36s)]
*  that's been hanging over speakers for a long time, could quickly go away and it may ease [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=305.96s)]
*  passage for Ukraine funding. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=310.44s)]
*  Yeah, it does feel like we may be approaching a bit of an inflection point. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=311.68s)]
*  Brandon Buck, terrific analysis as always. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  We will talk to you again very soon. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHktLasLfHo&t=318.03999999999996s)]
