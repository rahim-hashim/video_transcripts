# Bidens host July 4th celebration at the White House
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE)
*  The White House celebrated America's independence yesterday with a barbecue, a concert, and of course, plenty of fireworks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=0.0s)]
*  Returning from a weekend at Camp David, President Joe Biden addressed military members in the crowd, whom he called the protectors of democracy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=7.0s)]
*  You are the sinew, the backbone, the reality of who we are. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=17.0s)]
*  Unbreaking, unbending. Throughout our history, remind us that democracy is never, never, never guaranteed. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=23.0s)]
*  Every generation must fight to maintain it. We must always cherish it, defend it, and strengthen it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=33.0s)]
*  Later in the night, the president switched to the role of MC to introduce the night's final musical act, where he was met with enthusiasm for his re-election bid. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=43.0s)]
*  Hey everybody! Welcome to your house, the White House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=54.0s)]
*  We're just renting. Think how music can change moods, music can make us feel better. It's just incredible. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=63.0s)]
*  And I thought we had some great, great entertainment here tonight. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=72.0s)]
*  Well, now you're making music to my ears. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=88.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8foNZfwtEbE&t=92.0s)]
