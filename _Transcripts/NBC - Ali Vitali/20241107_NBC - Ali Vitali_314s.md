# Sen. Sanders criticizes Democratic leadership
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg)
*  Senator Bernie Sanders, who easily won his re-election bid on Tuesday, is now criticizing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=0.0s)]
*  the Democratic Party and its leadership in the wake of Donald Trump's resounding win [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  and Republican gains across the country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=10.84s)]
*  Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, released a statement yesterday [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=13.6s)]
*  that reads in part this, it should come as no great surprise that a Democratic party [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=18.44s)]
*  which has abandoned working class people would find that working class has abandoned them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=23.32s)]
*  First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and black workers as well. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=29.08s)]
*  While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=35.12s)]
*  and want change. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  And they're right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=41.76s)]
*  Joining us now, one of our stalwarts, senior NBC News national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Jon, thanks again for joining us this morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  So let's talk about Senator Sanders' criticism there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=52.16s)]
*  How did the Democrats take these working class voters, including voters of color, for granted, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=55.8s)]
*  and talk to us about what the Trump campaign sees as his appeal to that same group? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=61.0s)]
*  It's a great question, Jon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=66.44s)]
*  I mean, first of all, I think Sanders is largely right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=67.44s)]
*  You know, obviously the numbers show that he's right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  On the other hand, he was leading Joe Biden's agenda from the Senate. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=75.92s)]
*  He was writing budgets. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=79.96s)]
*  It's an odd person to make the criticism that Democrats abandoned the working class because [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  he was right there at every step of the way. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=86.84s)]
*  You know, in terms of what they're going to need to do to get back working class voters, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=89.4s)]
*  particularly the voters of color that they lost, I mean, you know, I think they have [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=92.76s)]
*  to start from what is it that those voters actually want? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=97.0s)]
*  Not what is it that the politicians want that they can sell to those voters, but what is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=101.16s)]
*  it that those voters want? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=104.92s)]
*  If you look at the two campaigns you had, the most Trump voters said their biggest issue [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=106.68s)]
*  was the economy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=113.56s)]
*  Second most was immigration. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=114.56s)]
*  For Harris voters, it was democracy and abortion. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=116.28s)]
*  The two candidates were talking about completely different things. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  And to Bernie Sanders' point, in most elections, the candidate that's winning on the economy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=121.68s)]
*  is the one that is winning the election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=128.4s)]
*  Yeah, certainly there are. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=130.16s)]
*  That's one of the many things Democrats are looking at as they come to grips with what [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=132.32s)]
*  happened on Tuesday. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=135.96s)]
*  There's a lot of regret, a lot of finger pointing in. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=138.16s)]
*  John, a lot of those fingers are pointed at President Joe Biden, belief that had he [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=140.4s)]
*  stepped out of this race sooner, perhaps after the 2022 midterms, that would have given either [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=145.8s)]
*  a Vice President Harris more time to introduce herself to voters or create a primary process [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=151.08s)]
*  where whether it's Harris or someone else would have come out of there sharpened and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=156.88s)]
*  toughened and better known. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=161.0s)]
*  Talk to us about the latest you've heard from the party as they look at 1600 Pennsylvania [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=162.78s)]
*  Avenue and assess the blame. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=166.62s)]
*  I mean, certainly there is a belief among a lot of Democrats that the original sin was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=168.82s)]
*  Joe Biden choosing to run for reelection. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=173.62s)]
*  You know, whatever we've seen from him, you know, I think Nancy Pelosi asked condition [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=176.22s)]
*  or episode whatever we've seen from him over time, there's been a progression and there [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=181.14s)]
*  were signs before he got into this campaign that he was certainly slowing down physically, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=186.22s)]
*  that he had some, you know, had some some challenges beyond just the physical. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=192.18s)]
*  And and he decided to run anyway. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, there was not a hewing cry in public to try to stop him from doing that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=199.34s)]
*  Certainly there were Democrats I spoke to at the time that thought it was a bad idea, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=205.66s)]
*  but they weren't going to go out there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=209.34s)]
*  They weren't going to get read out of their party for heresy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=211.14s)]
*  So, you know, that's part of the that's part of the discussion here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=213.62s)]
*  But also, you know, I think most Democrats thought going into Election Day that Kamala [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  Harris had a pretty good chance of winning and then were surprised to find out that she [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  didn't. So there was not so much criticism of Biden, you know, before the results came [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=224.7s)]
*  in. Yeah, certainly a lot of this is Monday morning quarterbacking and once a Democrat [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=230.33999999999997s)]
*  telling me that it was insulting to voters that they think that an 81 year old Joe Biden [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  could have won again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=237.7s)]
*  John, though, but Biden did hover over this campaign. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=239.06s)]
*  And look, a lot of Democrats think the vice president Harris, as you said, ran as good [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=241.54s)]
*  as just about as good of a campaign as she could have in the 100 odd days or so that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=244.94s)]
*  she was the candidate. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=249.06s)]
*  But one misstep has been pointed out to me by several, which is when she went on The [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=250.22s)]
*  View, asked to differentiate herself from President Biden, didn't really have an answer. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  Biden's polling remains underwater. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=258.7s)]
*  Democrats, you talk to how much role do you think that played? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, many of them think that she should have been able to separate themselves [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=264.06s)]
*  from a president who was unpopular period, you know, but that was not something she did. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure the next few weeks will help us understand why. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=273.06s)]
*  But but yeah, that definitely did not help her. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=275.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, some of the loyalty, I am certain. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=279.74s)]
*  But that was a pivotal moment to be sure. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=282.54s)]
*  Lots of analysis ahead about where Democrats go from here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=284.98s)]
*  Senior NBC News, national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=288.38s)]
*  John, thank you as always. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=291.3s)]
*  We'll talk to you again real soon. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foTyeA9-cg&t=292.34s)]
