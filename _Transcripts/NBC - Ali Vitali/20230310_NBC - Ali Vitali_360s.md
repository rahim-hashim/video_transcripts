# Biden lays out $6.8T budget proposal
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4)
*  Jeff Gears now another major headline this morning. President Biden has laid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=0.0s)]
*  out his nearly $7 trillion budget proposal, including a plan to increase [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=3.24s)]
*  taxes on corporations and the wealthy while increasing spending on the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=7.4s)]
*  military and programs for the poor and middle class. But in a divided Congress [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=10.82s)]
*  is highly unlikely to pass as is NBC News chief White House correspondent [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=15.48s)]
*  Kristen Welker has more [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=20.6s)]
*  in battleground Pennsylvania, President Biden unveiling his sweeping budget [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=23.52s)]
*  proposal calling for major tax hikes on the wealthy and increased spending. My [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=27.82s)]
*  budget is going to give working people a fighting chance. It's gonna create [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=32.74s)]
*  good paying jobs. Still, with divided government, that plan is dead on arrival [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=37.1s)]
*  with Republicans staunchly opposed to any new tax increases. But Mr Biden's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=43.06s)]
*  proposal likely a blueprint for his battle plan against Republicans in his [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=48.18000000000001s)]
*  2024 reelection bid. Magan Republicans all voted to get rid of the Affordable [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=53.16s)]
*  Care Act. They voted to get rid of it over 50 times since Barack passage. The [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=58.32s)]
*  $6.8 trillion plan calls for protecting Social Security and shoring up Medicare [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=62.8s)]
*  by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, including increasing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=68.82s)]
*  penalties on oil and gas companies, imposing a billionaire tax of 25% and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=73.14s)]
*  hiking the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28% and it includes record spending [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  on the military and increasing funding for social programs like early [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=84.92s)]
*  childhood education and childcare. But Republicans blasting it as a reckless [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=88.94s)]
*  tax and spend plan. What does this budget do? Raise more taxes, spends more [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=94.18s)]
*  money, creates probably the biggest government we've ever seen in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=99.26s)]
*  history of the United States. The president's plan also an attempt to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=102.84s)]
*  revive his standing in our latest NBC News poll. Just 36% say they approve of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=106.72s)]
*  his handling of the economy and just 32% say they are enthusiastic or [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=112.64s)]
*  comfortable with him running for office again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=117.84s)]
*  Joining us now White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal. My friend Ken [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=123.0s)]
*  Thomas Ken. Thanks for being on set with us here in Washington. So as just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=126.4s)]
*  discussed, uh, the Republican Congress is not gonna just give this rubber [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=130.96s)]
*  stamp. So what are some things that the Biden administration is really gonna [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=134.84s)]
*  fight for? What are the priorities here? I think a big priority is protecting [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=138.08s)]
*  Medicare and Social Security. The president has been talking about that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=142.44s)]
*  as as a real line in the sand. I think the other key thing here is that this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  is really gonna be a fight over claiming that mantle of fiscal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=151.08s)]
*  responsibility. The president is talking about the deficit reduction that he [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  has in the works, and he's almost, you know, trying to get Republicans to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=159.26000000000002s)]
*  jump on that ship, but but also provide revenue. I mean, I think that's really [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=164.76s)]
*  where this is going to break down the White House wants to raise revenue on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=168.6s)]
*  by raising taxes on the wealthy corporations, investors, and that's a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=174.16s)]
*  nonstarter for Republicans. So I think if there's any takeaway from yesterday [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=179.2s)]
*  is how far apart the two sides are at the start of this process. Yeah, it's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=184.08s)]
*  definitely a messaging budget, more so the one that could actually get passed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=188.44s)]
*  And we know the president's fond of saying budgets reflect priorities. It [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=191.88s)]
*  does feel like it's a gauntlet here for Republicans as as this presence we [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=195.32s)]
*  expect to in the next few months announce about 2024. He's really putting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=199.04s)]
*  the onus on the GOP and say, Hey, let's see what you can do about this on the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=202.88s)]
*  campaign trail. Right. And that's the advantage that the White House has [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=206.04s)]
*  right now. They're working with a vacuum. It's very unclear at this point [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=209.16s)]
*  when the Republicans will provide their own budget. I think it's gonna be a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=213.4s)]
*  matter of weeks. And what was interesting yesterday in Philadelphia, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=217.66s)]
*  we heard the president say, I want to make clear I'm ready to meet with [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=221.0s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy tomorrow. If you have a budget proposal, let's, you know, put [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=225.28s)]
*  our two proposals side by side. Let's compare them and go from there. So, you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=230.8s)]
*  know, the White House is, you know, the president's gonna be on the West Coast [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  next week. We're gonna hear him talking about this proposal. And I think this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  setting that we saw him in yesterday in a union hall in Philadelphia is gonna [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=242.68s)]
*  be replicated in the weeks ahead, you know, making the case for his for his [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=247.04s)]
*  agenda. Yeah, we certainly noted on air yesterday that it was unusual for a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=250.92s)]
*  president to deliver the budget outside of the White House. There's nothing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=253.92s)]
*  unusual for this president about going to a union hall, particularly one [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=256.84s)]
*  Philadelphia where he is all the time. Lastly, though, of course, shadowing all [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=260.12s)]
*  of this, Ken is the looming fight over the debt ceiling. And, you know, it's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=264.32s)]
*  certainly there's no meeting between McCarthy and Biden on the White House [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=269.14s)]
*  schedule today. How do you see that playing out in the months ahead? As [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  president, he went first with his budget. We'll hear from the GOP soon [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=275.8s)]
*  enough. It's gonna be a looming issue for the next few months. You know, this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=278.8s)]
*  is likely something that they're gonna have to deal with by, say, the end of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=283.2s)]
*  July. Typically, the budget fights on spending or more in the August early [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=287.2s)]
*  September range. And so, you know, I think we're gonna see just, you know, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=293.2s)]
*  a lot of loggerheads or the next few months. And, you know, I was talking to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=297.76s)]
*  a senior Democrat last week about this, and he was noting that one of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, off ramps that you typically have is the creation of some kind of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=306.0s)]
*  blue ribbon commission. You know, we saw it in 2010 with with Simpson Bowles. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=309.56s)]
*  And the question now, though, is in this new House Republican majority is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=314.58s)]
*  something like that acceptable? You know, are they willing to, you know, more [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=319.8s)]
*  or less punt the football a bit and and, you know, have a create a commission [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=323.32s)]
*  and take those recommendations? It's hard to see that being palatable right [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=327.52s)]
*  through at least some of the Republican voices because you're right. There's [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  nothing more Washington than a blue ribbon commission. White House reporter [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=334.04s)]
*  for the Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas. Great to see you, my friend. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWIp2MDQLZ4&t=337.28s)]
