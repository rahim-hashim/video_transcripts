# Biden leading Trump 49 to 45 percent in new general election polling
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE)
*  There's new polling that finds President Joe Biden leading Donald Trump in a hypothetical [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=0.0s)]
*  general election matchup. In the brand new Quinnipiac University survey, Biden holds a [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=4.88s)]
*  four-point advantage over Trump. It's 49% to 45% among registered voters nationwide. Now, that is [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=9.36s)]
*  within the polls margin of error and essentially unchanged from a survey taken last month. But when [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=16.16s)]
*  third-party candidates are included on the ballot, the poll shows that Biden's lead decreases to just [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=21.28s)]
*  a single point, 38 to 37. They have Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 15. Those numbers are consistent [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=26.24s)]
*  with other recent polls which have shown an extremely close race. Some have Trump up slightly, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  some have Biden up slightly, almost all within the margin of error. Joining us now, politics [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=37.12s)]
*  reporter for Semaphore, Dave Weigel. So Dave, let's start with the polling here. I feel like [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=41.28s)]
*  when Trump has a lead in a poll, big headlines. When Biden has a lead in the poll, a little bit [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=49.2s)]
*  less. But we want to make sure we underscore that he is up in this one, though of course, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=53.52s)]
*  it's very close. This far out, mid to late February, do these general election polls tell [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=56.96s)]
*  us much of anything other than, hey, it's going to be close? Yeah, they tell us what problems he [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  needs to fix. And one that has shown up in states, especially in Michigan and the Midwest, is he's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=65.44s)]
*  losing a chunk of the left that voted for him in 2020 because, not of Ukraine, because of Gaza. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=70.72s)]
*  And that is why you see it in any poll that tests Kennedy, it tests Cornel West, tests Jill Stein. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  They're doing quite well right now because of a lot of Democratic attrition in his vote. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=81.12s)]
*  The economy is improving. Biden's actually, if you look at Quinnipiac too, people are saying less and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=85.2s)]
*  less that the economy is their top worry, that the country's on the wrong path. They are worried [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  about individual Biden policies that it is hard for him to win the election without fixing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=93.84s)]
*  So big pick, I know some Democrats, strategists, certainly worried about the third party candidate [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=98.4s)]
*  possibility. Right. But they believe at the end of the day, come November, that there will be [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  Democrats who realize, hey, if I vote for a third party candidate, that's going to put Donald Trump [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=108.32s)]
*  back in office. But what kind of messaging can Democrats have? Is that going to be effective just [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  to say, look, the fear factor, if you will? It might be. I think it's depending on the reality [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=115.44s)]
*  on the ground. And I've talked to people running the Listen to Michigan campaign that's getting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=120.32s)]
*  momentum ahead of the Tuesday primary. What they want is a beachhead, the biggest vote for uncommitted [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=124.88s)]
*  possible to show that Biden needs to change course. But you talk to some of the people voting for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=129.68s)]
*  that and they say, some say, yes, we want to send a message and Biden could win us back. Some say, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=133.04s)]
*  we're done. We're going to stay on the sidelines. Those voters, I think those voters are harder for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=137.6s)]
*  the White House to grab back than maybe the people who just look at the president, look at his age, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=141.84s)]
*  and have not fully processed the choice with Trump yet. Yeah. Some of the Biden aides have confided to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=145.6s)]
*  me that they feel like some of those voters in Michigan might be gone. Yes. And then they're [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=150.88s)]
*  going to have to find other paths to victory, which would include winning back some of those white [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=154.88s)]
*  working class voters who have gone for Trump over the last couple of elections. So let's turn to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=158.88s)]
*  the GOP primary. South Carolina is Saturday. You just got back from several days in South [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=163.2s)]
*  Carolina. Tell us what are you seeing there on the ground? It is a really frozen race. Nikki [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=168.32s)]
*  Haley's had a month to compete in her home state since New Hampshire. She would not get the bounce [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=172.72s)]
*  she wanted, but she did get basically the run of the play. She's been campaigning across the state [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=177.04s)]
*  in a bus and not building momentum. You talk to her, the voters showing up for her. There are [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=181.28s)]
*  hundreds of each event. Some of them are Democrats who are going to vote for her as a protest vote, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  but they are not MAGA voters. One thing you notice when she makes jokes about Donald Trump, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=190.16s)]
*  or she says, if you donate to me, you're banned permanently from MAGA, your people will say, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=194.56s)]
*  hooray. They'll sarcastically say, oh no, those are not the average Republican voters. So it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=199.2s)]
*  looks like a pretty frozen race with a Trump advantage. I think that's why she spent this time [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=204.0s)]
*  on Tuesday spinning a potential loss in her home state as a reason to keep going. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Polls have shown she's chipped into Trump's lead a little bit, like going from 30 points down [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=213.92s)]
*  to 20. She's still almost certainly going to lose decisively. And nearly winner take all state. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=218.08s)]
*  She might end up with no delegates on Saturday and then say, I still need to keep going. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  If that happens, if she does take a blowout loss in her home state, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  what's the rationale for going forward? She laid it out on Tuesday that she just needs to be the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=230.24s)]
*  alternative for voters who do not want a Trump rematch for whatever reason. When that gets to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  policy, sometimes the reason gets a little bit less clear. You saw it this week in her answer [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=239.28s)]
*  on IVF to tally fatally. She is positioning herself as kind of all things to all people, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=243.84s)]
*  but then you try to pin her down on a specific issue. She has a conservative position that makes [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  it harder for those resistance voters, maybe the Democrats who donate to lose change, use [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=253.2s)]
*  reelection campaign. They're kind of blanching. I found that in South Carolina too. I did find [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=257.36s)]
*  Democrats who say, yes, the facts presented before me say that she is the protest vote to slow Trump [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  down, but I can't pull myself over the line. I mean, she had a couple of protests at events from [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=266.32s)]
*  union workers who still have issues with how she governed the state, how she was a self-proclaimed [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=272.48s)]
*  union buster. It's really tough for her to be the unity, everyone who doesn't like Trump and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=277.36s)]
*  everyone who doesn't like Biden candidate. Michigan's on the horizon for the Republicans [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=281.76s)]
*  as well. I haven't seen much of the way of polling out of that state. What are you hearing [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=285.92s)]
*  just from Republicans and say what they think Trump-Haley might look like there? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=289.36s)]
*  That Trump still has the advantage. It is an open primary, so independence again could vote for [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  Haley. I think this really is going to splash back on the primary and an effect on that race. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=297.04s)]
*  But also most delegates are going to be assigned at a party convention. Because of that, because [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  of who's been showing up for Michigan party conventions, kind of both because the party's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  internal dissension and it's split, those are very conservative, very pro-mega activists. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  She's going to campaign a little bit in Michigan, but she's going to focus on Super Tuesday states, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  even in the 72 hours she gets before that primary. Yeah, she's going to need to. She has said that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=322.88s)]
*  she's in the race through at least Super Tuesday. We'll see after that. Really good stuff this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=328.24s)]
*  morning from politics reporter for 7Fort. Dave Weigel. Dave, thank you for being with us. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=331.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJpus3eLiDE&t=352.32s)]
