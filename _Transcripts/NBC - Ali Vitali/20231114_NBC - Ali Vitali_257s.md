# House set to vote on two-step funding plan to prevent shutdown
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo)
*  With just three days left to avert a government shutdown, the House is set to vote today on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=0.0s)]
*  an unconventional plan put forward by Speaker Mike Johnson to keep the government open. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=6.04s)]
*  And at least for now, several Democrats appear to be signaling their support for the measure [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=12.44s)]
*  because it's clean, meaning it does not cut spending or attach other conservative policy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=18.28s)]
*  add-ons. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=24.48s)]
*  The Democratic caucus will meet later this morning to formalize their position on the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=25.96s)]
*  plan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=30.76s)]
*  At the same time, at least eight House conservatives have said they will vote no on the continuing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=31.76s)]
*  resolution, known as the CR, which must get the support of at least two-thirds of the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=38.28s)]
*  chamber to pass. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  If approved, it would then head to the Senate. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=45.28s)]
*  Under this two-step laddered plan, the CR would extend funding for several spending [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  bills needed to keep the government running until January 19th. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=55.22s)]
*  Funding for the remaining bills would go on a CR until February 2nd. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=59.78s)]
*  Joining us now to help us understand this, politics reporter at Semaphore, Kadia Goba. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=66.26s)]
*  Kadia, great to see you this morning. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=70.7s)]
*  Thanks for starting us off. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=72.34s)]
*  So let's begin with the Democrats. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=73.66s)]
*  There are some who have signaled support for Speaker Johnson's plan. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=75.42s)]
*  Tell us how he seems to have won them over and what's their calculation in saying, you [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=80.28s)]
*  know what, we're going to do this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=84.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think the key here is that Speaker Johnson has a very uphill battle. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=86.98s)]
*  He's coming with a fractured caucus who just ousted their previous speaker. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=93.82000000000001s)]
*  But he also has a very, very tight majority. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=99.38s)]
*  So with that said, I think he's gained some favor with Democrats by making this a clean [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  CR. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=108.5s)]
*  That is something that minority leader Hakeem Jeffries insisted on a couple of days ago. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  So I think he's positioned himself well to get Democrats on board with that CR, even [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=118.04s)]
*  knowing that he's going to lose some of his Republicans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  So what is the current whip count, do we think? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=128.68s)]
*  Do they have the votes to get this through? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=131.32s)]
*  I would say so. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=134.4s)]
*  There's about eight Republicans who said they won't vote for the CR, but there's far more [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=135.8s)]
*  Democrats who just wanted a clean CR that would totally be on board. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  And when you hear people like the leader Jeffries messaging that that is something that would [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=146.44s)]
*  be appealing to him, I think you could imagine most of the caucus will just go along. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  So we'll be here again with more Democrats voting for a Republican speaker's measure. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=157.52s)]
*  Nikadia, I know you've been following this closely and have some new reporting about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=164.8s)]
*  how this has been a real test for this brand new speaker, a speaker who took the office [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  with a lot of his own colleagues, not really even knowing who he was or necessarily what [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  he stood for. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=176.68s)]
*  What's the sense as to how he's fared? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=178.44s)]
*  I think he's garnered a lot of goodwill, and largely because people do know his conservative [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=181.68s)]
*  background. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=190.08s)]
*  working with ADF. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=192.08s)]
*  And I've been talking to a lot of conservatives outside of the Hill, and they just have all [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=195.08s)]
*  great things to say about him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=201.16000000000003s)]
*  Those are some of the same people who are in the era of members in Congress. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=203.88000000000002s)]
*  So he does come with some goodwill, some trust also. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  And when you talk to these people, they just say, you know, he's a good guy, and we think [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  he'll do what's right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=219.24s)]
*  You heard Good say there just now that, you know, he inherited a really bad deal, so he's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=220.86s)]
*  doing the best he can. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  So even though there are people who would push back against this kind of clean CR, I [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=229.06s)]
*  think he's in a good position. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlliq97nsUo&t=234.98000000000002s)]
