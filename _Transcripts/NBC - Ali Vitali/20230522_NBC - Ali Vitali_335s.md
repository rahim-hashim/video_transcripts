# Debt ceiling talks to resume after breakdown over weekend
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk)
*  As we take a look at live pictures of the United States Capitol, we turn back now to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=0.0s)]
*  the debt ceiling. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=5.84s)]
*  Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated the United States government may [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=6.84s)]
*  run out of money as soon as June 1st. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=11.4s)]
*  And joining us now to talk about it, co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=14.6s)]
*  She is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=18.66s)]
*  Good morning, Anna. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=20.6s)]
*  This is a big moment, to say the least. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=22.06s)]
*  President Biden back from the G7. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=25.32s)]
*  You're set to meet at the White House later today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=28.14s)]
*  Looks to be just a one-on-one meeting. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=31.2s)]
*  No other members of leadership there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=32.96s)]
*  Break us, break down where we are in terms of what are the main issues that are still [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=35.2s)]
*  holding back a deal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=39.56s)]
*  It feels a little bit like deja vu from us speaking last week and then a couple weeks [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=42.32s)]
*  before that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=46.92s)]
*  The contours of the negotiations remain strikingly similar, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=47.92s)]
*  We are talking about how much is it we're going to be spending? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=53.72s)]
*  Are there going to be worker requirements? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=55.96s)]
*  Is there permitting reform as part of this? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=58.2s)]
*  But we have really been at a stalemate here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=60.84s)]
*  And as much as there has been negotiations and even a meeting at the staff level over [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=62.64s)]
*  the weekend yesterday, we're pretty much at an impasse. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=67.56s)]
*  And so that is why we're seeing this meeting between the two principals, between the speaker, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=72.12s)]
*  between the president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Today it is really unclear, though, because I don't quite see what is going to change [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=77.76s)]
*  meet in terms of actually getting to a deal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=84.2s)]
*  And we are 10 days out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=88.56s)]
*  So that's what's the most important thing to think about, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=89.84s)]
*  We are 10 days from a deal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=93.04s)]
*  And that means that if you really want to put something together, it's that we don't [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=94.72s)]
*  default on the debt, then you're talking about really coming to a deal so that it can get [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  to the House in the next couple of days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly the markets may start reacting soon, the closer we get to that deadline. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  So I wrote over the weekend about how the White House approached this with it's sort [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=108.28s)]
*  of how it's always done, trying to sort of work in a bipartisan fashion. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  They're risking alienating the left. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  They want to prioritize deal making. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  They feel like they'll be rewarded by voters for getting a hard thing done. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=119.04s)]
*  They'll forget sort of the beltway noise that came along the way. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=123.04s)]
*  But it was striking, and like how the rhetoric really changed in the last 24 hours, White [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=126.0s)]
*  House really blasting the Republicans and how they've been handling negotiations, the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=129.76s)]
*  GOP returning fire. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, is real worry starting to set in that this is not going to get done, that we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=136.36s)]
*  actually may head over the cliff for the first time? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=142.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the politics here have been really interesting to watch, particularly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=145.28s)]
*  from the White House. I think they really misread Republicans on this, right, where [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=148.88s)]
*  they felt like the Republicans were going to fracture as they have in so many other [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=152.76s)]
*  instances where you would have had the Senate Republicans and the House Republicans in a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=156.84s)]
*  different spot. So far, they have stayed together in a really pretty amazing way [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=160.56s)]
*  behind Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=166.12s)]
*  And you have also the pressure that Democrats and the president is having with the left [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=168.76s)]
*  flank, right, where you have all of a sudden a lot of the progressives saying, let's do [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  the 14th Amendment. That is a strategy we should have. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=176.6s)]
*  We should never have even gotten into negotiations to begin with. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=178.76s)]
*  And so I think when you look at the push pull here from this administration, how does [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=182.6s)]
*  Biden thread the needle here? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  I think that is going to be the big question. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=189.0s)]
*  And I do think that when you look at what the markets did last week, right, they were [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  almost like that they felt like a deal was baked in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  The question is going to be does the does one of the indexes drop a thousand points? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=197.28s)]
*  If that happens, you could see all of a sudden people start to move. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  If not, there is that discharge position petition rather in the House, which is we need [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=204.56s)]
*  some Democrats or some Republicans to come on board. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=209.88s)]
*  There's 213 Democrats on that petition expected by the end of today, but they need to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=212.0s)]
*  get that magic to 18. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  And so that would mean you'd have to have some moderate Republicans get very nervous [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  that a deal is not going to get done. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the two things that White House aides concede caught them by surprise, as you say, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  Republican unity, because McCarthy took so many votes to even become speaker, they thought [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=228.44s)]
*  he wouldn't be able to hold the conference together. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=232.92s)]
*  But secondly, they just thought they'd have a little more time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=234.72s)]
*  The ex-state came to early June. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=236.56s)]
*  They thought they'd have till July or August. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=238.0s)]
*  That certainly impacted the president's foreign travel there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  And one more for you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, even if a deal is struck between McCarthy and Biden, if not today, but in the coming [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=244.28s)]
*  days, they still got to get this through the House. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=249.04s)]
*  And is there a sense that McCarthy is that the moment where maybe the conference could [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=251.44s)]
*  fracture, that if he makes some sort of deal that's deemed unacceptable to those on the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=256.72s)]
*  far right, well, they're going to need some Democrats then to vote for that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=260.6s)]
*  What's the calculus look like? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=264.92s)]
*  They're probably going to need some Democrats to vote for any kind of a deal. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=267.32s)]
*  Let's be clear here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=270.0s)]
*  You know, Kevin McCarthy is dealing with a five seat majority. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=271.0s)]
*  And the fact that you've already had a lot of the House Freedom Caucus members say that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=276.16s)]
*  they aren't going to vote for anything except for the Republican plan in the House, which [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=280.04s)]
*  is just a nonstarter for Democrats. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  So I think the bigger question is, can Biden not only get a deal with Republicans, but [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  then can he appease Democrats on a lot of things that they are probably not going to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  want in order to get many of them to vote for this package, not only in the House, but [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  also in the Senate? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=300.12s)]
*  And there has been this thought that maybe Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell would [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  interject himself in the negotiations, save the day even for short term extension. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  But no sign that's coming. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=307.8s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=310.12s)]
*  Great stuff as always. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=312.12s)]
*  I'm certain we'll be speaking to you again soon. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMuAeBDjKVk&t=313.04s)]
