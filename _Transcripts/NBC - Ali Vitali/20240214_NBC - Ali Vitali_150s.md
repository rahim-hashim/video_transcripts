# Nikki Haley calls on President Biden to resign
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg)
*  Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is now calling on President Biden to resign. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=0.0s)]
*  She made the comments during a radio interview yesterday following the release of special [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=5.48s)]
*  counsel Robert Herr's report that described Biden as an elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=9.56s)]
*  I have written a piece for Fox News this morning saying Joe Biden should simply resign. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=17.3s)]
*  He is not competent. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=21.76s)]
*  He is infirm and I've known that for a long time, but now the Herr report has persuaded [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=22.76s)]
*  me he's impaired. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=27.64s)]
*  Do you believe the president should resign? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  And I think the Democrat Party knows that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=32.36s)]
*  And I think that it is not just in the best interest of their party, it's in the best [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=34.64s)]
*  interest of the country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=38.88s)]
*  What I will tell you, and I've said this from the very beginning, the party that gets [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=40.32s)]
*  rid of their 80 year old candidate is the party that will win. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=44.72s)]
*  Haley has been calling for competency tests for both Biden and Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=50.6s)]
*  Joining us now, special correspondent at Vanity Fair and host of the Fast Politics podcast, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=54.6s)]
*  Molly Jung. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=59.52s)]
*  Molly, great to see you this morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=60.52s)]
*  So let's start there with Nikki Haley's call for President Biden to resign. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  Spoiler, he's not going to resign. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=67.64s)]
*  But she has for a while now really put the idea of mental competency and age as sort of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=70.08s)]
*  the center of her campaign, talking about both Trump and Biden. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=74.76s)]
*  How relevant is that going to be for either man in these next few months? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's something people love to talk about with both these candidates and their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=82.48s)]
*  old candidates. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=86.24s)]
*  I mean, again, Trump is only two and a half years younger than Biden. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=87.48s)]
*  So, you know, it's not like he's you know, Biden is running against a 45 year old and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump is definitely not the Trump he was four years ago. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Look, Nikki Haley is doing a very strategic thing here, right? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=100.8s)]
*  She's trying to run against both Biden and Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=103.72s)]
*  I don't think that that works. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=107.8s)]
*  And I actually think voters don't love ageism. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=109.8s)]
*  And we've seen this again and again. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=112.6s)]
*  And if you look historically like Reagan, you know, people tend not to vote on that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=114.32s)]
*  But I don't think Nikki Haley has a lot of choices. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=119.28s)]
*  No, Haley, we should again note down significantly in the polls in her home state of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=122.28s)]
*  South Carolina, ahead of that primary in about 10 days time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vgG1dvOzOg&t=126.88s)]
