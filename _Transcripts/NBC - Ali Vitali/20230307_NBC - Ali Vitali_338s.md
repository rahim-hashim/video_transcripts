# Hope Hicks meets with Manhattan prosecutors: NYT
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y)
*  Welcome back. There are new signs the inquiry is escalating into former President Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's role in paying hush money to an adult film actress during his 2016 presidential [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=6.68s)]
*  campaign. There are times reporting that Hope Hicks, once a senior advisor to the former [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=12.24s)]
*  president who served as spokeswoman for that campaign, was seen walking into the Manhattan [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  District Attorney's office yesterday. Hicks is at least the seventh witness to meet with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=22.34s)]
*  prosecutors since the D.A., Alvin Bragg, convened a grand jury back in January to hear evidence [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=27.64s)]
*  in the case as prosecutors investigate Trump's hush money payments to Stormy Daniums. The [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=33.2s)]
*  Times reports it was not clear if Hicks was testifying before the grand jury or was only [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=39.24s)]
*  meeting with prosecutors to answer their questions. A spokesperson for the D.A.'s office and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Hicks' attorney both declined to comment. Joining us now, the founder of the conservative [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  website, the Bullark, our friend Charlie Sykes. Charlie, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=56.26s)]
*  Let's just get your reaction to what seems to be the latest sign that the legal peril [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=62.18s)]
*  for Donald Trump is increasing. There are so many fronts, Manhattan, Georgia, January [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=69.7s)]
*  6th, the Mar-a-Largo documents. Let's talk though about the political impact. As this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=74.9s)]
*  approach is, is this going to hurt or help Trump in the Republican primary field? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=83.5s)]
*  Well, first of all, Jonathan, I am starting to feel like Lucy with the football, with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=88.82s)]
*  all of these legal issues. Like, let's wait until we see what actually happens. We've [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=94.22s)]
*  been promised this so many times, as you know. But the question you asked whether it will [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=98.9s)]
*  help or hurt, right now, given the state of the Republican Party, it is certainly possible [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=104.94s)]
*  that Donald Trump could be indicted and that it could actually strengthen his hold on the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=111.06s)]
*  party, in part because his opponents have not yet decided that they're ever going to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=115.7s)]
*  break with him on something like this. So there is a rally around the flag. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=122.58s)]
*  Look, that was a very dark speech the other day at CPAC. And I think people actually ought [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=125.7s)]
*  to pay attention to it when he talks about, you know, I am your retribution. He uses the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=130.26s)]
*  word retribution twice. He basically is saying, look, I stand for vengeance. This is not a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=135.7s)]
*  morning in America campaign here. This is Donald Trump. I am nemesis. And if you're running on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  that with that kind of a persona, indictments will actually just simply feed into that sense [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=152.26s)]
*  of victimization in the Republican base. So at this point, it's hard to say, but I [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=158.98s)]
*  just don't see the Republican Party moving away from him, even if he is indicted at this point. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=165.46s)]
*  Yeah, Trump, of course, also downplayed January 6th again, deeming it a very important day. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=171.86s)]
*  Certainly, as you say, a very, very dark speech. Let's get your analysis of where things stand [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=176.82s)]
*  right now. I mean, he did win the CPAC straw poll. That's no surprise. That was a MAGA gathering, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=180.58s)]
*  basically. DeSantis Looms, we discussed about him earlier in the show, that right now, at least, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  he's the guy that seems to be coalescing the anti-Trump forces, but he hasn't been nationally [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=190.34s)]
*  vetted. We don't know where that goes. But give us a sense of where you think DeSantis stands right [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=194.9s)]
*  now. And is there any other Republican out there, Pompeo, Pence, Haley, Tim Scott, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=199.3s)]
*  someone else that's not on the radar right now that you think could actually make a run at this? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=204.02s)]
*  No, right now, DeSantis has the best position. He is broadly acceptable at the moment to much of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  the MAGA base. Not obviously all of it, but much of it. He's also acceptable to the so-called [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=215.46s)]
*  normies. I think the business community seems to be open to him. Many of the major donors are open [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=221.54s)]
*  to him. But to your point, we don't know what Ron DeSantis is going to look like as a presidential [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=229.06s)]
*  campaign and a reminder of all of the governors who look great on paper and then fell flat on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=235.22s)]
*  their face. And I have to say that I'm starting actually to become a little bit more bearish on [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=240.73999999999998s)]
*  DeSantis because I'm trying to imagine how his appeal and his relentless culture warrior rhetoric, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=247.06s)]
*  which has sort of gotten into a doom loop now, the same thing over and over and over again, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  how that's going to scale up nationally. We also have no idea how he's going to take the punches. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  What happens when eventually he's on a stage with Donald Trump and Donald Trump comes at him? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=265.78s)]
*  Trump has already signaled that he's coming after anybody that poses a real threat to him, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=272.34s)]
*  and DeSantis does. He started off by suggesting he was a groomer, so that escalated pretty quickly, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=277.61999999999995s)]
*  didn't it? As for all of the others, I'm not sure what their lane is at this point. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=282.5s)]
*  And if early on Donald Trump knocks out Ron DeSantis, I think that he's on a glide path [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  to the nomination as opposed to Republicans turning their lonely eyes to Mike Pompeo or [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=295.94s)]
*  Nikki Haley. I mean, it can't be said enough how early we are in the process, but it suddenly [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=301.46s)]
*  feels like Trump has momentum again, which I guess we shouldn't be surprised at considering [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=305.7s)]
*  he seems to just be always there. Charlie Sykes, thank you. We greatly appreciate your analysis [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=310.1s)]
*  and hope we can speak to you again soon. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=315.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96difpdDv7Y&t=325.94s)]
