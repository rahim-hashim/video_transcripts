# Trump on Roe overturning: We did something that was amazing
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8)
*  Ahead of the two-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade being overturned, Donald Trump once again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=0.0s)]
*  bragged over the weekend about being responsible for that Supreme Court decision. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=4.76s)]
*  Speaking at a Christian conference on Saturday, Trump claimed that everybody, including Democrats, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=10.28s)]
*  wanted to see Roe overturned. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=16.0s)]
*  In a separate moment, he also told the crowd that after this presidential election, he [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=17.48s)]
*  doesn't care whether they vote or not. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=22.62s)]
*  The whole thing was they wanted, the Roe v. Wade was federal and they wanted it all back [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=26.88s)]
*  in the states where the people could vote and make their decisions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=31.52s)]
*  It's now up to the will of the people in each state. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Some states will be more conservative, other states will be more liberal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  It's happening now. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=41.88s)]
*  You see the votes are all taking place and it's the way every legal scholar and just [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  about all the Democrats and all the Republicans and conservatives and liberals, they all wanted [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=48.0s)]
*  it that way and we did something that was amazing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=52.92s)]
*  Christians go to church but they don't vote that much. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=57.84s)]
*  Do you know the power you have if you would vote? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=61.2s)]
*  It wouldn't even be so. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  You got to get out and vote. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  Just this time. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  In four years you don't have to vote, okay? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  In four years don't vote. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=72.08s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  But we'll have it all straightened out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump also over the weekend suggested a UFC-style fighting league for migrants. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=78.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, also ahead of the second anniversary of the Dobscision, Mika sat down with Vice [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  President Kamala Harris and reproductive rights advocate Hadley Duvall. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=90.76s)]
*  Here's part of that important conversation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  What is at stake in this election? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=99.28s)]
*  So much. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=101.92s)]
*  You know, if you have a woman in your life that means something to you, her life is at [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=102.92s)]
*  stake. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  It does not matter if she is 12, 9, 34, you know, it really does not matter. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=108.64s)]
*  If there is a woman who is in that reproductive age, then, you know, her life is at stake [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=116.32s)]
*  during this election. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  And it does not matter if you've never voted Democrat in your life, you know, it's get [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=125.52s)]
*  off your high horse because women, we don't get to choose, you know, a whole lot and you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=131.0s)]
*  at least can choose who you can vote for. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=136.88s)]
*  And there is a lot of things that need to be worked on. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  And you know, we can't get it all done. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=144.16s)]
*  But at the very least, we could get out of women's business when it involves their health [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=146.56s)]
*  care. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=151.04s)]
*  And I've always said, you know, I'm I'm pro-mining your own business. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=152.04s)]
*  Live your religion. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=155.24s)]
*  You know, live it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=156.24s)]
*  Live it loudly. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=157.24s)]
*  But don't expect your religion to make the laws. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=158.72s)]
*  And Madam Vice President, two years to the day that Roe was overturned. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=162.3s)]
*  What's at stake in this election? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=166.72s)]
*  I agree with the athlete. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Everything is at stake and fundamentally on this issue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=170.04s)]
*  It's about freedom and every person of whatever gender should understanding that if it's such [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=175.64s)]
*  a fundamental freedom, such as the right to make decisions about your own body can be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  taken? Be aware of what other freedoms may be at stake. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=192.78s)]
*  The small percentage of the country that is pro-life, because predominantly the numbers [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=199.54s)]
*  show that people support abortion across the board, nationally. Can you explain that abortion [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=203.62s)]
*  is not just for people who are pregnant? That this is health care? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=209.54s)]
*  It is health care, and- [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=214.06s)]
*  Dr. Harris. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=215.38s)]
*  Yes, yes, exactly. Yes, correct, and you are right, and you are right that this issue really [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=216.38s)]
*  does present a health care crisis in America, including the fact that I am, as it turns [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=223.78s)]
*  out, the first vice president, and no president, has visited a reproductive care clinic. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=229.62s)]
*  And one of the reasons I went to that clinic was to highlight that in those clinics that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=237.06s)]
*  are trusted in the community, there is, you can get a PAP, breast cancer screening, HIV [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=242.1s)]
*  screening, the things that where people want to be able to walk into a health care facility [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  and be treated with dignity and without judgment so they can address their health care concerns. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=256.34s)]
*  That's what these clinics do, and in states where they pass these Trump abortion bans, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=263.26s)]
*  these clinics are closing, which means that there is a reduction of very essential health [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=267.58s)]
*  care across the board for a lot of people. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=273.7s)]
*  Mika's full interview with Vice President Harris is ahead today on Morning Joe. You [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=277.34s)]
*  will not want to miss that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hexUW7f1HF8&t=282.7s)]
