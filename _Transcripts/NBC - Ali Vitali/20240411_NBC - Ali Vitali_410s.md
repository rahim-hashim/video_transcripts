# Speaker Johnson to deliver remarks with Trump on election integrity
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson will travel to Mar-a-Lago tomorrow, where he is expected to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=0.0s)]
*  deliver remarks alongside former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=4.62s)]
*  Johnson says the focus will be on, wait for it, election integrity, as well as free and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  fair elections. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  The move comes as Johnson faces an ever-shrinking razor-thin majority in the House, as well [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=15.9s)]
*  as pressure from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who continues to threaten to force [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=20.62s)]
*  a vote on his potential ouster. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=25.78s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst Brendan Buck. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  He was communication strategist and former aide to House Speakers Ryan and Boehner. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=32.32s)]
*  Brendan, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  Let's just start with the nonsense here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=39.2s)]
*  These two men are going to appear together to talk about election integrity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=41.68s)]
*  Donald Trump, of course, is still pushing the big lie. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  He is still refusing to acknowledge he lost the 2020 election. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=47.959999999999994s)]
*  And we know Johnson was the author of some of the legal briefs that supported that and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  still backs it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=55.64s)]
*  That gives your sense. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I've been really curious to see how they are defining election integrity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  Obviously, there's the dynamics you just explained. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=62.06s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump has also been talking about these trials as election interference [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=64.86s)]
*  and whether or not there's some angle here where they're talking about the House doing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=69.1s)]
*  more oversight of these trials. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=72.9s)]
*  So that's very curious to me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=75.9s)]
*  I'm also just sort of curious as to how this came about in the first place. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=77.94s)]
*  I understand, of course, why Mike Johnson would want to stand next to Donald Trump right [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=81.86s)]
*  now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=86.18s)]
*  He's been pushing for his job and Donald Trump's the most popular person in the party. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=87.2s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure why Donald Trump feels the need to stand next to Mike Johnson at [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=90.2s)]
*  this point. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=93.56s)]
*  This is not somebody who's particularly popular and someone who's been pushing a number of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=95.44000000000001s)]
*  policies through the trial or trying to through the House that Donald Trump opposes, whether [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=100.48s)]
*  it's the foreign spying bill that failed yesterday or his push on Ukraine Donald Trump is opposed [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=103.92000000000002s)]
*  to. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=109.68s)]
*  So I'm a little concerned that Donald Trump is trying to get something out of Mike Johnson [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=110.68s)]
*  and what that will be. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=113.0s)]
*  I guess we'll find out. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Trump, of course, as you just said, has scuttled some of Johnson's agenda. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=115.66s)]
*  Also let's remember the example of Kevin McCarthy, who spent his entire time in office trying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=119.94s)]
*  to cozy up to Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=123.82s)]
*  And then at the end of the day, Trump didn't come to save him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=125.46s)]
*  Yeah, if he's banking on Donald Trump to be a reliable partner to save him, yeah, Kevin [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=127.94s)]
*  McCarthy would like to have a word with him about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=133.46s)]
*  This is a bizarre pairing here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=137.26s)]
*  I mean, as much as Kevin McCarthy was an ally of Donald Trump, I don't recall them ever [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=139.34s)]
*  having a press conference like this together. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=144.16s)]
*  My former boss certainly never did. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=146.44s)]
*  And so it feels to me like there's some some type of trade going on here of what's going [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=149.88s)]
*  on. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=155.95999999999998s)]
*  But yeah, Donald Trump can certainly protect Mike Johnson to a certain degree. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  But I don't know that Marjorie Taylor Greene is necessarily going to step aside. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=162.48s)]
*  As we've seen, she seems pretty dedicated to coming after Mike Johnson. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that she will say she's just as close of an ally as Donald Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=170.62s)]
*  So I don't know that this necessarily saves him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=174.58s)]
*  But I am worried that what Mike Johnson may potentially give away to Donald Trump, maybe [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=176.34s)]
*  scuttling Ukraine, for example. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=180.3s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to have to keep an eye on that tomorrow. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=181.94s)]
*  Let's talk a little more about Marjorie Taylor Greene and her threats. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=184.38s)]
*  We played some sound earlier in the show. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=187.18s)]
*  She's still very much on this, saying that Johnson's leadership on issues like FISA and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=189.26s)]
*  Ukraine make her think more or less that he's not up for the job. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=194.06s)]
*  Republicans, though, will they really want to go through this process again? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=199.06s)]
*  Will she have support? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  They don't want to go through this process, but I would say they didn't want to go through [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  this process with Kevin McCarthy either. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=207.26s)]
*  That was really unpopular in the conference. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=209.34s)]
*  But we've got a situation where all it takes is one member who can force them into it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=211.7s)]
*  And what this feels like is she is trying to build that that requisite support to go [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=216.1s)]
*  there. This is all good politics for Marjorie Taylor Greene, where she comes from. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=220.82s)]
*  She doesn't she's never really cared about being popular within within her conference. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  It would be absolutely chaotic. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's the argument that Mike Johnson is trying to make. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=230.0s)]
*  Do we really want to go go through this again? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=232.6s)]
*  And the obvious reality that it doesn't matter who the speaker is, when you have a one or [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  two seat majority, you're not going to be able to impose your will on a Democratic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=239.36s)]
*  Senate and a Democratic White House. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=244.36s)]
*  She doesn't seem to care about that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=246.28s)]
*  But it does seem very, very possible that she could bring this chaos in the House. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  And as we've discussed before, then it all may come down to whether Democrats want to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=252.88s)]
*  save Mike Johnson, which is a terrible place to be in if you're the House Republican [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  speaker. So dysfunction seems to be the order of the day quite frequently for House [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=260.09999999999997s)]
*  Republicans. Brendan, yesterday, one of the more chaotic yet, the FISA bill goes down, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=264.02s)]
*  the Marjorie Taylor Greene threats. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=269.29999999999995s)]
*  Just give us a big picture here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=270.94s)]
*  I mean, you spent so much time in this chamber. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=272.5s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like this before? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=274.97999999999996s)]
*  And do you have any hope at all that it's going to get better? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=276.7s)]
*  I've never seen it. And we don't need to get too much into the procedural weeds here, but [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=280.02s)]
*  they can't even bring bills up for a vote. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=284.8s)]
*  That's what happened yesterday on the floor. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=286.72s)]
*  They didn't even vote down the foreign spying bill. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=288.56s)]
*  They weren't able to bring it up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=291.52s)]
*  The House is very quickly turning into the Senate where you need huge bipartisan [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=293.16s)]
*  majorities to do anything, which sounds nice. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  But the House is built to act as a simple majority. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=299.68s)]
*  And frankly, the House has been able to skate by without Donald Trump really getting too [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=302.88s)]
*  involved in their in their business until now. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=306.76s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy was able to pass a big bipartisan debt limit increase with Donald Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=309.88s)]
*  largely staying quiet. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=314.68s)]
*  Now Donald Trump is front center. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=316.48s)]
*  This is the reality that I lived in for two years where he wades in casually, usually [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=317.92s)]
*  half informed on what we're doing and takes things down like yesterday. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=323.8s)]
*  The FISA reforms that were in there, the things he asked for, he ends up scuttling the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=327.52s)]
*  bill by just doing a simple post on his true social site. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=331.64s)]
*  And Brandon, lastly and briefly, Speaker Johnson yesterday acknowledged the possibility [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=335.08s)]
*  that some moderate Republicans might even vote for Hakeem Jeffries to be speaker if [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=339.76s)]
*  Johnson were ousted. Do you see a scenario where that could happen? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=343.7s)]
*  A Democrat could lead this chamber. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=346.14s)]
*  I don't. I think that's Johnson sort of grasping at straws. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=348.74s)]
*  There's a scenario where Johnson or Jeffries could end up with the most votes if [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=351.58s)]
*  Republicans vote present, which you've seen them do a few times. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=356.26s)]
*  It's a simple majority of the people voting. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=359.5s)]
*  That's not going to happen. Even if Jeffries somehow ends up with the most votes, they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=361.5s)]
*  could vote to remove him very quickly, too, with the majority that they have. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=365.26s)]
*  But that just shows you Johnson doesn't have a whole lot of great arguments right now. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=369.14s)]
*  He knows that he's dealing with someone who's irrational. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=372.72s)]
*  And I don't think that's going to dissuade her from from going after. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TerUL_cCgHw&t=375.40000000000003s)]
