# McConnell and Trump to meet for the first time since 2020
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo)
*  Welcome back. Tomorrow, former president Donald Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=0.0s)]
*  will meet face to face for the first time in more than three years. Trump and McConnell [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=4.96s)]
*  have not spoken since December of 2020, when McConnell publicly congratulated Biden for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=10.32s)]
*  winning the presidential election. McConnell, the longest serving Senate leader in U.S. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=15.24s)]
*  history, has made clear of his distaste for Trump, but yet still endorsed him back in [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=19.84s)]
*  March. Joining us now to talk more on this is MSNBC political analyst Brandon Buck. He [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=24.28s)]
*  was a communications strategist and former aide to House speakers Ryan and Boehner. Brandon, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=29.8s)]
*  good to see you this morning. Does anything about this meeting surprise you that McConnell [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=35.2s)]
*  has agreed to meet with Trump? And why do you think this meeting with Trump and Republicans [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=41.92s)]
*  on the Hill matters? Yeah, I mean, Mitch McConnell hates Donald Trump, but he loves the idea of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=46.36s)]
*  winning back the majority, securing his legacy more than anything. So he's going to put his [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=53.6s)]
*  pride aside and have this meeting and talk about, which is actually a somewhat normal [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=58.24s)]
*  meeting. You have a potential, you have your party's nominee. You're going to plan for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=62.84s)]
*  the next year. It's a normal thing that a party leader would do. Obviously, they have [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=65.92s)]
*  a very strained relationship. I'll be very interested to see how Trump treats McConnell [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=69.88s)]
*  in that meeting. These are awkward, sometimes very small, intimate settings, and Trump is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=75.04s)]
*  known to call out friends or jeer at rivals. So I think there will be some tension in the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=79.76s)]
*  room. But I imagine McConnell will sit there very quietly, say very little, and he's not [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=86.32s)]
*  going to be a leader next year. So he'll allow others to set the agenda. So elsewhere, the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Republican Party, we had some primary results last night, including Nancy Mace surviving [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  a challenge, a challenge backed by former speaker Kevin McCarthy. What's your take? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=100.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was an interesting play by Kevin McCarthy. He went around and found a lot of money from [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  some rich folks to go after a sitting member who voted to oust him. I'm with Kevin McCarthy [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=110.52s)]
*  in sentiment that the people, the eight people who voted him out, did some real damage to the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=116.28s)]
*  institution and really broke it for a long time. But Nancy Mace was never really showed any signs [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=121.16s)]
*  of vulnerability. It was a long shot to begin with. And the fact that we have so many member on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=127.44s)]
*  member primaries or members challenging each other is really toxic for the institution. I think [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=134.04s)]
*  it's really bad. And so while Kevin McCarthy was trying to sort of fight back against these [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=138.44s)]
*  forces that were that are sort of eating the House conference from the inside, I think he's only [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  adding to it because you've got this primary this week, you've got Bob Good next week. It seems like [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=146.28s)]
*  every week you have a House Republican member who has to worry about their primary. And that is the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=151.88s)]
*  exact dynamic that has hurt us. At the end of the day, it's if you have Donald Trump on your side, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=156.28s)]
*  though. I mean, that's what's been proven time and time again. Bob Good, the Virginia congressman, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=161.96s)]
*  is likely to lose his primary next week. Hardline conservatives still potentially could lose his [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  primary because Donald Trump's coming after him here. In this case, Donald Trump didn't go after [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=171.96s)]
*  Nancy Mace. And that proved to be the difference no matter how much money Kevin McCarthy had. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=175.8s)]
*  So let's turn to some other twenty twenty four storylines we've been covering all morning. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=179.0s)]
*  Hunter Biden guilty verdict yesterday. AIDS from frankly both campaigns don't really think [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=182.68s)]
*  it'll play have changed much of the trajectory of the race. What's your analysis? Does it become [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=189.0s)]
*  anything that the Republicans will use or are they hamstrung by the fact that, wait, wait a minute, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Hunter Biden's not on the ballot. Donald Trump is. He just got convicted, too. Yeah. I mean, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  I think there's been some wishful thinking that this will end some of the Republican conspiracy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  theories about all of this, you know, showing that obviously the Justice Department isn't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  solely being used to go after Donald Trump. I don't think you can really worry about people [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=212.44s)]
*  like that. I mean, they've made up their mind and they're not going to be swayed by facts like this. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=217.24s)]
*  I'm most interested to see how this is handled in the debate. You know, you would think that Joe [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=222.2s)]
*  Biden would come at Donald Trump for being a convicted felon. Not hard to see Donald Trump [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  coming right back at Joe Biden in very personal ways and how the president would respond to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=232.04s)]
*  something like that. That could be a very powerful moment. May handcuff Joe Biden a little bit and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=235.88s)]
*  being able to bring up the conviction thing because he knows that he's going to get counterpunched. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=240.83999999999997s)]
*  But the reality is Donald Trump will probably bring it up himself. Yeah. So I have some reporting on [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=244.76s)]
*  this after the aftermath of the verdict. I mean, the Biden campaign is still going to lean into [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=248.68s)]
*  convicted felon. They say they're not going to shy away from it. Biden himself will probably on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  occasion do the same, potentially even at the debate. And some aides are encouraging, or at least [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=256.52s)]
*  talking among themselves, that if Trump does come after Biden about Hunter, which I'm sure he will, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=261.0s)]
*  President Biden will take it personally, that maybe it would be okay to flash some anger. That [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  would be a normal personal human response. And we know Americans, a lot of them can really sympathize [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=269.4s)]
*  about people who are struggling with addiction. Yeah. If he's able to rise above it, I think that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=275.08s)]
*  would be smart because in some ways it's depressing. This is the thing that we're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=277.88s)]
*  arguing about whose conviction is worse and doesn't inspire a lot of the gravity of the moment that we [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=281.8s)]
*  should be talking about. I don't think in the end of the day, either conviction is really what people [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=289.24s)]
*  are going to be voting on. And so it's to what you're getting at, can someone change the dynamic [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=294.36s)]
*  around it? Can they rise above it in a positive way? And potentially Joe Biden is well positioned [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=300.44s)]
*  to do that. Yeah. But for that and for so many other reasons, that debate now just two weeks, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=305.08s)]
*  so weeks away, looms a very important marker in this race. We really appreciate you being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=308.84s)]
*  here. MSNBC political analyst Brendan Buck. Thank you as always. Come back soon. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=313.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QalJqUlnBJo&t=335.08s)]
