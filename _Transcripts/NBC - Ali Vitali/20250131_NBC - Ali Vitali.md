# Trump intel nominees grilled in confirmation hearings
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE)
*  President Trump's key national security nominees faced tough questioning from lawmakers during [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=0.0s)]
*  confirmation hearings yesterday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=4.68s)]
*  NBC News Chief Capitol Hill correspondent Ryan Nobles has those details. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=6.32s)]
*  A pair of President Trump's top national security nominees facing high-stakes confirmation hearings. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=10.32s)]
*  There will be no politicization at the FBI. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=16.92s)]
*  Former federal prosecutor Cash Patel nominated for FBI director, the staunch Trump supporter [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=19.44s)]
*  pressed by Democrats about his independence. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=24.72s)]
*  Would you be willing to resign the post of FBI director if pressed and given no choice [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=27.36s)]
*  but to obey the order or resign? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=32.12s)]
*  Senator, I will always obey the law. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=34.76s)]
*  And President Trump's pardons of violent offenders from January 6th. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=36.84s)]
*  I do not agree with the commutation of any sentence of any individual who committed violence [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  against law enforcement. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=45.92s)]
*  Patel strongly defended by Republicans. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  The reason you're here is because most of the public, almost every Republican believes [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=50.04s)]
*  that the FBI has been used continuously in a political fashion lying to get Donald Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=57.28s)]
*  Across the Capitol, former Democratic Congresswoman and combat veteran Tulsi Gabbard nominated [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=65.52s)]
*  for director of national intelligence. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=70.4s)]
*  What truly unsettles my political opponents is I refuse to be their puppet. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=72.56s)]
*  Gabbard pushing back on claims she parroted Kremlin talking points. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=78.2s)]
*  I want to make certain that in no way does Russia get a pass in either your mind or your heart. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm offended by the question because my sole focus, commitment and responsibility is about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  our own nation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  And pressed over her previous call for a pardon for Edward Snowden, who fled the U.S. after [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  releasing a trove of government secrets. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  Edward Snowden, a traitor to the United States of America. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=106.08s)]
*  I understand how critical our national security is. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=109.72s)]
*  Apparently you don't. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=113.08s)]
*  Thanks to Ryan Nobles for that reporting. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=115.52s)]
*  Joining us now, former deputy press secretary for the Department of Defense, Sabrina Singh. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=117.52s)]
*  We also have former Republican Congressman Carlos Curbelo of Florida. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  He's an MSNBC analyst as well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  Carlos, I want to start with you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=127.28s)]
*  Of course, big day on the Hill for Trump's nominees. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=128.92s)]
*  We'll start with Cash Patel because I think there was a really fascinating thread that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=132.12s)]
*  I saw between Patel that we've seen from most of these other nominees to this idea of distancing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=135.36s)]
*  from the very things that make them controversial picks in the first place. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  For Patel, it was on January 6th and trying to soften his stance, even breaking quote [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  unquote with the president saying that violent offenders shouldn't have been pardoned for [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  what they did on January 6th. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=154.52s)]
*  But I think it's a question of will people actually believe that just because they got [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=156.8s)]
*  nominated to these posts, they've suddenly changed their tune? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=165.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is the key, Ali, because all of these controversial nominees, especially the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=166.2s)]
*  three we've seen this week, their emphasis, their big goal has been to distance themselves [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=170.6s)]
*  from some of the comments that make them controversial. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=177.64s)]
*  Of course, especially the Democratic senators are honing in on that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  I think Patel, in terms of his temperament and his performance, he did a pretty good [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=183.76s)]
*  job and I think it was surprising to a lot of people that he would be willing to contradict [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=189.16s)]
*  President Trump on the issue of these January 6 pardons for those who committed violent [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=194.0s)]
*  crimes, assaulted police officers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=199.72s)]
*  So he does get some points for temperament, but he still hasn't gotten the guarantees [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=202.04s)]
*  from the Republicans he needs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=207.08s)]
*  You know, RFK, I think he had a tougher time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=209.12s)]
*  He really got into it with some senators and Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=211.36s)]
*  I think that's the weakest of the three controversial nominees at this point, Ali. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=214.84s)]
*  We keep hearing that, Carlos, and Sabrina here with me in D.C., I think the thing that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=219.94s)]
*  was so striking and that I keep coming back to during all these hearings is something [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=224.98s)]
*  that Senator Gillibrand said actually to Pete Hegseth. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=228.38s)]
*  She said, you've had these long-held views on women not serving in combat roles. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=230.62s)]
*  I'm just not sure I believe that you've suddenly changed your tune. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=235.26s)]
*  And so when you see Cash Patel, who is a flamethrower in the press, on podcasts, in media, suddenly [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=238.74s)]
*  sitting before that committee in a much more, I'll use the word demure, despite the fact [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=244.64s)]
*  that it has the connotation of being viral now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=248.73999999999998s)]
*  But in a more demure sense, is that the temperament that he's just trying to present? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=251.06s)]
*  And does he have the temperament in totality to run this kind of an agency? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=256.38s)]
*  Look, I think, you know, he presented his case, and like you said, he was more demure [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  than we've seen before. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=265.82s)]
*  But that's not going to change the fact that he has a long history of promoting these conspiracy [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  theories. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=271.78s)]
*  I mean, he went up there and denied that he was on some of these podcasts where there [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=272.78s)]
*  was anti-Semitic views being pursued. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=275.54s)]
*  And that podcaster even said, no, we text all the time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=277.74s)]
*  So I think you have to believe who these people are when they what they say. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  And it's incredibly disturbing, not just Cash Patel, but I mean, Tulsi Gabbard as well, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=285.5s)]
*  being up there saying she couldn't emphatically say that Edward Snowden was a traitor. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  I think you absolutely have to take them at their word. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=293.82000000000005s)]
*  And if they were to be confirmed, it's even more concerning the type of policies they [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=296.70000000000005s)]
*  would put into place as agency heads. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=300.5s)]
*  Well, that's right, because we're, of course, talking in the immediate term about the confirmation [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=303.22s)]
*  battle, Sabrina. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=306.86s)]
*  But you're not just looking at what they say there. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=307.86s)]
*  You're trying to extrapolate out what they might do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=310.7s)]
*  And Hegseth is actually a blueprint, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=313.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=315.14s)]
*  I mean, he got in. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=316.14s)]
*  He did those confirmations hearings and we're seeing these policies play out in real time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=318.06s)]
*  I mean, just look at the press conference yesterday. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=322.38s)]
*  Secretary, now Secretary Hegseth, doubling down on Donald Trump's assertion that somehow [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=324.74s)]
*  DEI was responsible for the crash that we saw yesterday is just, I mean, it's absurd. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=329.42s)]
*  We haven't even been 24 hours out from this investigation still and we haven't gathered [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=334.90000000000003s)]
*  the facts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=339.14000000000004s)]
*  And that's exactly what these nominees are going to pursue. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=340.14000000000004s)]
*  They have their audience. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  Their audience is Donald Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=344.18s)]
*  It's an audience of one they're going to play to his strengths. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=345.42s)]
*  You saw Cash Patel, you know, somewhat differentiate himself there yesterday. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=348.86s)]
*  But I think we know who he is and he's shown us that multiple times. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=352.82s)]
*  That's what we need to take away from these hearings. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=356.3s)]
*  Carlos, I want to ask you, when it comes to Tulsi Gabbard, you made the point. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=359.06s)]
*  And again, this is things that I've heard from my sources as well, that she's the weakest [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=363.94s)]
*  link potentially of all of these nominees. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=368.14s)]
*  So what did you make of the senators questioning her yesterday? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=371.3s)]
*  Did she do herself any favors? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=374.24s)]
*  I think she missed a big opportunity, especially when Senator Lankford, who we know has publicly [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  expressed doubts about her over the last few weeks, he asks her directly, is Mr. Snowden, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=382.66s)]
*  someone who stole top secret information from the United States, shared it with her adversaries, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=389.82000000000005s)]
*  with her enemies? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=397.3s)]
*  Is he a traitor? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=398.3s)]
*  And she could not answer that question. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=399.3s)]
*  It's really very different from what Cash Patel did, for example, with the January 6th [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=401.42s)]
*  rioters, right? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=406.98s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard missed a big opportunity. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=408.22s)]
*  Again, she also presented very well in terms of temperament, but in terms of substance, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=410.7s)]
*  she missed an opportunity, I think, to give her that boost she needed with some of those [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=416.7s)]
*  skeptical Republicans that I think at the end of the day are not going to come around [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=421.06s)]
*  to supporting her. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=425.78s)]
*  Yeah, I do think Lankford is one that I'm watching closely, especially as I've had [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=426.78s)]
*  conversations with him, where he was assuaged by some of the things that she said when it [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=432.06s)]
*  comes to intelligence gathering and surveillance programs in their private meetings, but certainly [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=436.3s)]
*  that was an important line of questioning yesterday. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  I think, Sabrina, for someone like you who has been in the rooms where officials are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=443.1s)]
*  making decisions based on sensitive intelligence information, it's important to remind that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=447.44s)]
*  our allies don't just share information because it's mandatory. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=452.42s)]
*  They do it because there's a trust factor. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=457.62s)]
*  So what role would Tulsi Gabbard play, and that's the concern, in a deteriorating relationship [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=459.90000000000003s)]
*  there? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=465.06s)]
*  I think what's concerning is she also might not know the role that she plays and how important [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=466.82s)]
*  that role is. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=470.22s)]
*  I mean, you are the convening authority when it comes to intelligence and pooling information [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=471.22s)]
*  from different agencies and then briefing the president, members of the National Security [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=476.38s)]
*  Council, and of course the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=481.06s)]
*  Information that is collected and parsed through and analyzed by people that have been doing [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=484.98s)]
*  this for a very long time and have that experience, if you can't brief the president on some of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=488.34000000000003s)]
*  the basic issues, or you have an affiliation or a side, for instance, with Russia, and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=492.62s)]
*  believe that Russia is not the aggressor here when it comes to Ukraine, that is incredibly [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=498.18s)]
*  disturbing, not just to our allies, but I think that should send a real shiver through [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=502.46s)]
*  the intelligence community. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=506.5s)]
*  And that is what we saw on display yesterday. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=507.74s)]
*  I will say, despite the fact that we're having conversations about what makes them controversial [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=510.54s)]
*  or pitfalls in their resume or general qualifications for these roles, I was talking to a senator [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=514.9s)]
*  yesterday and I asked them, do you think that these folks will get confirmed even despite [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  all of that, even despite Republicans that have concerns? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=523.82s)]
*  And they said ultimately they believe yes. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=526.78s)]
*  We'll ultimately see if that's how it shakes out. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=529.14s)]
*  But Sabrina Singh and Carlos Corbello, thank you both for joining us on the high stakes [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=531.0600000000001s)]
*  of this moment. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnQhgvKqqE&t=535.14s)]
