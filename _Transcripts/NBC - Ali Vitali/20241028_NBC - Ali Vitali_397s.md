# Speaker Johnson: After election, GOP will control Congress
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc)
*  There's an energy out there that we have not seen before. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=0.0s)]
*  And I am convinced, I am convinced that in nine days we are going to grow the House majority, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=6.4s)]
*  we're going to take back the Senate and send Donald Trump back to the White House. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=12.88s)]
*  Let me tell you why that is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=24.44s)]
*  Let me tell you why that is. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=25.68s)]
*  Because everywhere around the country, no matter where you live, everybody is fed up [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=26.68s)]
*  and they are fired up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=31.2s)]
*  They're fed up. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=33.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter what demographic they're in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=34.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter what walk of life. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  They know that we cannot afford four more years of Kamala Harris in the White House. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=37.72s)]
*  That was House Speaker Mike Johnson speaking at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=44.0s)]
*  last night. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=48.6s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst, Brendan Buck. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=49.92s)]
*  Brendan was communications strategist and former aide to House Speakers Ryan and Boehner. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  Brendan, let's just start off by getting your take last night on that spectacle we saw at [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=58.28s)]
*  Madison Square Garden where speaker after speaker flat out racist, insulting, offensive [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=63.48s)]
*  comments about the vice president herself among about a number of groups, including [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=69.96s)]
*  Puerto Ricans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=76.12s)]
*  How is that a helpful closing argument for the Trump campaign? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=78.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they clearly couldn't help themselves. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=82.28s)]
*  This is the last moment when you're trying to clarify the race. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=84.4s)]
*  And obviously this is a huge distraction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=88.08000000000001s)]
*  And I guess the Trump campaign trying to do what it feels like it should to clean it up, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=90.56s)]
*  I guess halfheartedly a bit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=94.92s)]
*  You know, I'm skeptical that this is going to change a whole lot. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  It seems to just play into what we already know about Trump and a lot of the folks who [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=100.92000000000002s)]
*  hang around him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=106.28s)]
*  It just, to me, reinforces the lack of discipline and seriousness within this campaign. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=107.44s)]
*  And frankly, the party today, this type of thing used to be a spectacle, as you said, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=113.92s)]
*  that would be a showstopper. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=121.16s)]
*  And everybody would be talking about how the candidate needed to disavow and we needed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=122.68s)]
*  to talk about what they're going to do next. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=127.8s)]
*  This thing's the wash over us. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=131.52s)]
*  And I think it is just it reinforces who Donald Trump has been and the type of people that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=132.76s)]
*  he wants to associate with. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=136.92s)]
*  Yeah, certainly angered a lot of people last night. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=138.64s)]
*  So, Brendan, let's talk about the state of the race. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, we've been talking a lot about last week about the vibes and because and there's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=144.0s)]
*  certainly Republicans certainly trying to suggest that they had the momentum. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  We just heard from Speaker Johnson. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=151.64s)]
*  There seem to be little people reading tea leaves idea that a couple of major newspapers, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  including the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, refused to make endorsements. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=156.88s)]
*  People read that as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  They don't want to alienate Trump. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  They think Trump's going to win. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=162.56s)]
*  We saw ABC News poll yesterday that actually was very encouraging for the vice president. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=164.08s)]
*  Give us your your take on just where things stand right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=167.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a bit hard for the last couple of weeks not to feel like the momentum [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=170.76s)]
*  was sliding towards Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=174.68s)]
*  Polls getting much closer than they had been, you know, perhaps perhaps weeks ago on the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=177.44s)]
*  flip side, we may be seeing a situation where the Electoral College advantage for Republicans [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=181.84s)]
*  isn't quite as large as we perhaps thought. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=187.0s)]
*  And some of these there hasn't been as big of a difference in the swing state polls [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=189.8s)]
*  as there has been in the national ones. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  Reality is we just don't know whether the polls are getting any of this right at this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=196.36s)]
*  point. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  And what we do know is this is about a toss up race. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's why these last this last week is so critical. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=203.8s)]
*  We know that Kamala Harris is having a big event tomorrow to try to raise the stakes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=208.0s)]
*  of the election. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  And you would think that that's what Donald Trump should be doing right now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  He's making, as we've talked about before, a big bet on some low propensity voters, voters [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=217.8s)]
*  who you're not really sure if they're going to turn out. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=221.08s)]
*  And the election could come down to whether he can motivate people who like him a lot [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=223.72s)]
*  but aren't necessarily usually the ones who participate in elections to come out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, I think we're finally at the point where it's OK to actually say it's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  going to come down to turnout. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  But it really, really may be the situation because there's very little you can glean [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  from these polling and even from early voting to say anybody has a clear advantage. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=240.56s)]
*  Yeah, Trump, this will be the third cycle in a row where he's trying to turn out voters [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=244.4s)]
*  who have never voted before, low propensity voters. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=247.72s)]
*  That's so hard to do. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=249.92s)]
*  This time around, young men, young men of color included. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=250.96s)]
*  Of course, for Harris, it's about women. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  It's about abortion rights being the big motivator there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=255.72s)]
*  So, Brandon, let's talk a little more about the polls do suggest the national polls that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=258.2s)]
*  Trump's made some gains. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=262.6s)]
*  But they seem to be in states that don't matter as much, the Electoral College, New York or [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=263.84s)]
*  California. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=268.24s)]
*  He's not going to win those. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=269.24s)]
*  But it may impact the House. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=270.3s)]
*  What's your take right now on where the two chambers of Congress stand eight days for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=273.72s)]
*  the election? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=276.48s)]
*  Yeah, it also feels a bit like a toss up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=277.48s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  There are, of course, swing seats all across the country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  We've got a couple in Iowa. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=284.92s)]
*  But there are, I think, nine toss up seats in California and New York, not typical battlegrounds. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=287.56s)]
*  And those could decide the election. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  And we don't have a whole lot of polling in areas like that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=295.5s)]
*  So what we're going to see is, is there enough momentum or, excuse me, enthusiasm in places [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=299.3s)]
*  like that to impact turnout? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  Mike Johnson, they're obviously going to say what he needs to say about being confident. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=309.38000000000005s)]
*  His job, I think, depends on holding the House. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  If Republicans lose the House, he's probably out of a job, even as leader of the party. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=317.1s)]
*  Look, there is a very good chance, though, at this point that Republicans will have a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=324.5s)]
*  clean sweep of government. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=328.98s)]
*  The Senate is almost surely going to go Republican. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=330.94s)]
*  And I'm actually not sure why the Harris campaign hasn't leaned into a little bit more the threat [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=333.3s)]
*  that they could present. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=336.5s)]
*  Not only could you be electing Donald Trump, but you could be electing unified Republican [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=340.14s)]
*  government to do whatever he wants to do. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=343.38s)]
*  I think that we often see in polling that when you talk about a message of checks and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=346.1s)]
*  balances, that works really well. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=350.58s)]
*  And on the flip side, presenting Donald Trump not only as being put back in power, but potentially [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=353.85999999999996s)]
*  having a Congress that will be unified and do his bidding, I think could be a pretty [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=358.3s)]
*  stark contrast. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=364.3s)]
*  Yeah, we'll have to see if the Harris campaign leans on that message the next couple of days. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=365.3s)]
*  We do, as you say, expect her to deliver a form of a closed argument tomorrow at the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=368.68s)]
*  ellipse there in Washington, the exact same site where Trump spoke on January 6th. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3DT2dzDNkc&t=372.68s)]
