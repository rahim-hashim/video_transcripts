# Harris campaign appeals to Black male voters
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU)
*  Welcome back. Vice President Kamala Harris sat yesterday for an interview with the online [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=0.0s)]
*  blog The Shade Room, a popular outlet for young black millennials. Harris was asked [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  about former President Obama's comments on black male support for her campaign. Let's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=17.76s)]
*  President Barack Obama, he was campaigning for you in Pittsburgh before some students [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=19.88s)]
*  at the University of Pittsburgh, which is my alma mater, and he said some things that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=25.82s)]
*  really ruffled some feathers in the news. He said, it makes me think you aren't just [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=31.1s)]
*  feeling the idea of having a woman as a president. So my question to you is, do you think that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=36.42s)]
*  what President Obama said was the right thing to say? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=41.26s)]
*  Let me tell you, I am very proud to have the support of President Obama and that he is [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=45.7s)]
*  out traveling to talk with voters about what is at stake in this election. I am very proud [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=52.26s)]
*  to have his support. What is also important is one, to understand, as I said, I intend [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=59.26s)]
*  to earn the vote of everyone, including black men. Two, pay attention to everything that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=66.26s)]
*  President Obama talked about, because he also talked about at length the danger of Donald [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=73.56s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=78.7s)]
*  Joining us now, White House correspondent for Politico and co-author of the playbook, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=80.9s)]
*  our friend Eugene Daniels. Eugene, good morning. Well, it's very clear the Vice President really [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=85.06s)]
*  didn't want to touch that subject just now in the clip we played. But her campaign, as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=90.22s)]
*  you well know, they're aware that they are lagging a little bit in support among black [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=95.86000000000001s)]
*  men. President Obama put his finger on it. So let's talk about how the campaign feels [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=101.7s)]
*  and what are their efforts at turning it around. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=107.34s)]
*  Well, number one, in having kind of the what are the best surrogates in democratic politics [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=110.1s)]
*  on your side is to not talk badly about that surrogate. So you're not going to hear Vice [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=114.82s)]
*  President Harris say anything kind of out of school when it comes to how she felt about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=119.94s)]
*  it. Well, what's very clear with this campaign is that they, in kind of this blitz that they're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=123.94s)]
*  doing this week, she did the shade room, she did Roland Martin, which is another very popular [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=129.12s)]
*  interviewer. She is doing Charlemagne, an interview with Charlemagne the God. Later on today, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=135.46s)]
*  she rolled out this kind of these policy prescriptions aimed at black men and their economic prosperity, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=142.58s)]
*  including small business loans, also including health initiatives that are disproportionately [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=150.58s)]
*  impact black men. And so it's clear that not just right now, but for a while they've been [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=158.5s)]
*  looking at what can we do to make sure that black voters in general, black men specifically [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=164.48s)]
*  actually come out to vote. It's been clear for years that black men, black voters have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=171.16s)]
*  started to be at least more interested in other folks when it comes to who they're going [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  to vote for in this election. That is not a Kamala Harris created problem, but it is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  one that she and her campaign have to grapple with as they move forward. Because, you know, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  if you get 78% of black voters, as it said in some polls, 87 and others, that's still [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=193.48s)]
*  less than what has gotten in years past, right? When it's been 90%. So something's happening [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=199.28s)]
*  is unclear why. But with the campaign, I talked to Quinton Folk, the principal deputy campaign [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  manager, and he said essentially this is about neglect from the Democratic Party over years, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=211.28s)]
*  right? It's not something that Harris has created, but it's something that black men [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  and black voters have felt for years from the Democratic Party. So they're trying to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=221.62s)]
*  rectify that. Yeah, we saw a poll over the weekend again showing that Harris is drawing [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=224.74s)]
*  less of the support from black voters and Latino voters than other Democrats. I mean, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=230.54s)]
*  she's still far ahead of Trump, of course. But if she can't pull off the right margin, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=235.58s)]
*  that may be trouble for her candidacy. But Eugene, it's also striking another moment [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=240.22s)]
*  we're here where the vice president simply not wanted to play identity politics. She [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  is not leaning in at all about the historic nature of her candidacy, either as a person [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=246.94s)]
*  of color or as a woman. Is there any... Tell us whether the campaign is rethinking that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=252.22s)]
*  strategy at all in these final three weeks. No, I don't think so. This is just not who [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=256.74s)]
*  Vice President Harris is or who she's been ever. She's never talked about being a black [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=260.98s)]
*  woman explicitly over and over and over again on the campaign trail in her entire public [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=266.04s)]
*  career. One of the things that Lafonza Butler, a former aide of hers and obviously now senator [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=271.18s)]
*  and ally and she's on working with her on the campaign, told me at the DNC was black [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=276.34s)]
*  women don't have to remind people that they're black women, that we, the collective we, will [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  constantly remind them for them. And so I think that's something that Vice President [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=287.82s)]
*  Harris thinks about, but she does wink and nod to it all the time. She talks about how [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=291.62s)]
*  her mother raised her and her sister, Maya, to be strong black women. She talks about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=296.02s)]
*  this iconic HBCU. She talks about being a member of Alpha Cup Alpha Sorority Incorporated, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=301.58s)]
*  which obviously is a black sorority. So for the... It's kind of the opposite of a dog [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=307.14s)]
*  was a right that the people that are supposed to understand what those things mean to her [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=311.62s)]
*  and to the culture, they understand those things. But I don't see that changing anytime [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=316.06s)]
*  soon. The Vice President, of course, on a blitz through the Blue Wall states, Michigan, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  Wisconsin, Pennsylvania this week. White House correspondent for Politico, Eugene Daniels. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=325.7s)]
*  Eugene, thank you as always. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVdCLglrxvU&t=330.14s)]
