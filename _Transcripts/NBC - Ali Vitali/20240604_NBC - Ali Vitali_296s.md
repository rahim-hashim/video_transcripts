# 'You have to be prepared': Doctor stresses readiness amid extreme summer heatwaves
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE)
*  Residents out west are bracing for the first real heat wave of the season, set to scorch [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=0.0s)]
*  the region with triple-digit temperatures. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=4.88s)]
*  Beginning tomorrow, excessive heat warnings will be in effect until Friday evening for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=7.84s)]
*  parts of California, Nevada and Arizona due to dangerously hot conditions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=11.52s)]
*  Some areas already reached triple-digit temperatures yesterday, with both Las Vegas and Phoenix [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=16.96s)]
*  hitting 103 degrees. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=21.54s)]
*  Fire crews will also be on high alert. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=23.6s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News medical contributor Dr. Vin Gupta. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=26.08s)]
*  Dr. Gupta, good to see you again. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=30.08s)]
*  So these are scary numbers and just the beginning though of a potentially sweltering summer. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=32.0s)]
*  What do we know as to how bad this particular summer could be and what's your advice for [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=38.44s)]
*  how to prepare for a heat wave this dangerous? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=43.4s)]
*  Well Jonathan, good morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for highlighting this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=48.8s)]
*  This is the issue of our time and what we're seeing is these heat domes here I'm sitting [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=49.8s)]
*  in Seattle, they're a really terrible one Jonathan you might remember in the beginning [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=54.6s)]
*  of this summer of 2021. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=59.36s)]
*  Something similar here in inland California all the way up through Oregon, San Joaquin [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=62.2s)]
*  Valley on up north, it might set some record when it comes to heat. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=66.64s)]
*  And so we have to be prepared. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  If you're watching this, frankly throughout the country you have to be prepared sitting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=73.48s)]
*  in New York City or in central California for what's about to come. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=77.68s)]
*  This is expected to be one of the worst summers when it comes to heat that we've seen on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=82.56s)]
*  record. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=86.36s)]
*  So how do you prepare to answer your question? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=87.36s)]
*  Make sure you're ready for sun exposure, heat and air pollution. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=89.4s)]
*  Have to have SPF 15 or higher sunscreen. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=92.8s)]
*  Jonathan you want to make sure that we're hydrating especially when it's humid outside [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=97.12s)]
*  about four liters up from what we would expect but a liter and a half to two liters in a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=100.6s)]
*  normal day, double that about four liters of water intake. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Really critical. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  We don't talk about this enough. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  Make sure you clean out your AC filters every few years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=111.56s)]
*  If you haven't done it in a few years and you have AC, make sure your ducts are cleaned [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=113.56s)]
*  out. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=117.36s)]
*  Make sure your filters are updated with MERV 8 and above. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=118.36s)]
*  And then lastly, when it comes to the air pollution around us, whether it's New York, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=121.24s)]
*  whether again it's on the west coast, go to airnow.gov, look for unhealthy levels, invest [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=125.32s)]
*  in air purifier in your bedroom. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=130.4s)]
*  If you're somebody with lung disease or heart disease, keep your refills on hand, Jonathan. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=132.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is such an important and dangerous story. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  And we'll certainly be watching all summer long. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Gupta, let's turn now to the COVID pandemic. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=142.83999999999997s)]
*  Certainly we know people in this nation, across the world, still battling long COVID. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=148.72s)]
*  But also give us an update as to where things stand now in terms of new variants, what sort [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  of infections levels are we seeing? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=156.88s)]
*  Where do we stand right now in this battle? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=160.6s)]
*  Much better place than when we were, Jonathan, when we used to have this conversation much [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=165.83999999999997s)]
*  more frequently. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=168.6s)]
*  People say that based on testing rates aren't high anymore, people have largely put this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=169.64s)]
*  on as something that they shouldn't worry about as much. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=174.72s)]
*  We do know that new variants exist, continue to be more transmissible, even if we don't [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=176.96s)]
*  talk about it, much more contagious. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=181.72s)]
*  Luckily, the vaccines continue to work, the therapeutics continue to work. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=183.72s)]
*  But case rates are high. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=188.12s)]
*  Of the tests that are done, case rates are quite high, actually remaining at the levels [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=189.6s)]
*  that we saw up to a few years ago. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=194.76s)]
*  There's still a lot of COVID-19 out there, especially if you're medically high risk, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=197.2s)]
*  something to take seriously because this continues to get more contagious. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, certainly vaccines still so important. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Gupta, lastly, and briefly, we played earlier in the show, Dr. Fauci being flat [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  out assaulted by some Republicans in Congress during hearings there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=212.6s)]
*  Just wanted to give you the floor for a moment to talk about what you defend, Dr. Fauci, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=216.92s)]
*  if you'd like, but also just remind viewers just about those early months of the pandemic, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=221.16s)]
*  just how fluid the situation was and how doctors and scientists tried their best and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=225.48s)]
*  frankly saved millions of lives. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, what I'll leave you with, I know we don't have a ton of time, is that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=231.56s)]
*  the vaccines have been estimated to save up to 1.2 million lives. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan, Dr. Fauci oversaw Operation Warp Speed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=240.28s)]
*  All the good work that went into saving all those seven figure lives was based on him [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=244.92s)]
*  and based on the work that was actually done here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=249.76s)]
*  So it's easy to forget it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=251.39999999999998s)]
*  It's easy to politicize it now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  But because of his work and his leadership, we're seeing a lot of averted deaths. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  And I think we missed that point as this issue has become so politicized. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, important words there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=262.92s)]
*  And in the months ahead, we'll certainly be checking back with you on the pandemic, but [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  also this summer heat and what we can do to stay safe. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  NBC News medical contributor Dr. Van Gupta, thank you as always. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5etVcuimYRE&t=272.8s)]
