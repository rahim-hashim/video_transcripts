# 'It's far tighter than most people expected': India counts votes after marathon election
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck)
*  Overseas now, India has begun to count the votes in its general election, which is widely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=0.0s)]
*  expected to result in a rare third term for its current prime minister, Narendra Modi. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  The process has taken six weeks, as votes were gathered from throughout the world's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=11.0s)]
*  most populous country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=15.0s)]
*  The Associated Press reports that roughly 642 million people voted in the general election, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=16.92s)]
*  equating to an average turnout percentage of about 66 percent. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  If Modi wins, he will become the second prime minister in India's history to serve three [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=27.6s)]
*  terms and the first in 60 years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=32.64s)]
*  Joining us now, international correspondent for The Economist, Avantika Chilkoti. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=36.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  I know you've been following you following Prime Minister Modi's career for years now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  You have a podcast dedicated to it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=48.8s)]
*  We're happy to have you join us this morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  So tell us what we know about the results so far. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=52.6s)]
*  It appears that Modi's party, the BJP, the BJP, is doing well, but not quite securing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=56.04s)]
*  the landslide that was expected. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=62.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's really, really interesting morning today because going through this campaign, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=64.16s)]
*  the BJP has really been talking the big talk. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=70.2s)]
*  This is a party that expected to have an absolute majority in parliament. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=75.16s)]
*  And throughout the campaign, there have been some questions about that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=79.44s)]
*  At some point, there was questions around voter turnout. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  As it's hot in the US right now, it's really hot in India. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=85.04s)]
*  And at that time, Modi was really amping up this Islamophobic rhetoric. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=87.84s)]
*  He was really sort of trying to turn out the Hindu nationalist base. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=92.56s)]
*  Exit polls came out on Saturday. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=96.72s)]
*  It seemed like it had worked. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=97.72s)]
*  It seemed like the Modi government was in for a massive victory. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=99.28s)]
*  And actually this morning, as the results come in, it's not looking good. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  It's far, far tighter than most people expected. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=107.92s)]
*  The opposition alliance is doing very well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=111.08s)]
*  It's not just the number of seats. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=113.24s)]
*  It's actually to do with the geographic spread. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=115.08s)]
*  If you think about the swing states you guys watch in the US, we have one big state in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=117.72s)]
*  India, Uttar Pradesh, UP. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  It's meant to be Modi's heartland and actually is running very, very tight. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=123.72s)]
*  It's sort of 10,000 votes between some of these seats. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=128.48s)]
*  So it's going to be a narrow victory for Modi, for a man who the entire government has been [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  centralized around him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=138.44s)]
*  There's a personality cult around him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=140.16s)]
*  It's going to be a very big change. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're certainly right. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=143.84s)]
*  A personality cult around Modi. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=145.28s)]
*  He is the state in many ways. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=146.88s)]
*  So assuming this holds, he does win, but perhaps more narrowly than expected. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  What lessons, what should we anticipate in the years ahead, both in terms of the continued [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=153.08s)]
*  push towards nationalism at home, but also India's place on the world stage? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=157.56s)]
*  So it's been two parts of Modi's vision for India, his offering. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  There's been this economic reform agenda. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=166.88s)]
*  He says he's a pro-business leader. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=168.88s)]
*  He's promising growth and to develop India. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=171.12s)]
*  And on the other hand, there's this Hindu nationalism, this sort of dangerous strident, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=173.68s)]
*  divisive politics. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=178.52s)]
*  And you see him as a leader play these two things up and down. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=180.04s)]
*  What this vote has said is, well, actually people aren't happy, in particular with the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=184.12s)]
*  economics. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  You've seen some estimates as much as 45% youth unemployment. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  You've got inflation that the poor are really, really complaining about this election period. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=192.88s)]
*  So you'll see that this economic agenda is slightly unraveling. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  And as he tries to navigate a coalition, this is not something that he's used to with a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  politician. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  How much can he continue his economic reform agenda? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  And will he choose to amp up and play up that dangerous Hindu nationalism? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  In terms of foreign policy, to be honest, I don't think much will change for India. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=215.48s)]
*  This country is in a geopolitical sweet spot for the US, for much of the West. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=218.76s)]
*  It's a completely invaluable counterweight to China. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=223.76s)]
*  And no matter what happens in the government, I think that will remain. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juBCRHjGck&t=226.64s)]
