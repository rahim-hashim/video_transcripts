# Biden campaign slams Trump on abortion access
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk)
*  We turn to politics now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump says he'll clarify his stance on abortion sometime next week. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=1.8s)]
*  At a campaign rally yesterday in Michigan, Trump was asked if he supported his home state [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=8.2s)]
*  of Florida's restrictive six-week abortion ban. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=13.66s)]
*  Mr. President, do you support the six-week abortion ban that the Florida Supreme Court [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=18.36s)]
*  just have held? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=22.64s)]
*  Trump's saying he'll make a statement next week. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=23.64s)]
*  President Biden responded on social media with a quote from Trump where he bragged about [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=37.44s)]
*  overturning Roe v. Wade, captioned with, quote, You already made your statement, Donald. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=42.16s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=49.84s)]
*  Good to see you, Julia. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  So, first of all, Trump's saying he'll have a statement next week is so reminiscent of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=55.68000000000001s)]
*  when he was in office and he was asked something he didn't want to answer. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  He'd say, Oh, we'll have a plan for you in two weeks, two weeks' time, two weeks' time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  And it would never occur. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=64.68s)]
*  So we'll see how long he can dodge this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=66.0s)]
*  And of course, abortion front and center again now because of what's happening in his home [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  state in Florida, that state's Supreme Court ruling that at least temporarily enforces [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=71.04s)]
*  ban and puts abortion access on the ballot again in that state in November. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=77.22s)]
*  So abortion, we know a big deal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=81.17999999999999s)]
*  Talk to us about how the Biden campaign plans to highlight it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=83.56s)]
*  And also, how do we expect Trump to try to navigate it? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=87.38s)]
*  Right, Jonathan, a very big deal, particularly in a state like Florida, a state where many [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=91.94s)]
*  of us were saying wasn't really going to be in play this election. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=97.44s)]
*  But now we're really starting to talk about it because of this issue of abortion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=101.06s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump understands this is a vulnerable issue for Republicans. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=104.9s)]
*  And you really just need to look at down ballot races and special elections across the country [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=109.5s)]
*  where we've seen in red states like Alabama, for example, or even that ballot measure in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=115.46s)]
*  Ohio last year where Democrats and abortion rights activists really campaigned and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=119.76s)]
*  were able to get victories on this issue. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=126.62s)]
*  So we know that Donald Trump has been very careful to navigate this in a post Roe versus [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=129.38s)]
*  Wade world. But right now he's really being put on the spot and delaying answering that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=134.98s)]
*  question is really only giving more, I guess, fodder and more ammunition in a way to his [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=140.9s)]
*  critics, Democrats and President Biden. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=146.86s)]
*  Now, the Biden campaign is full steam ahead on this issue. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=149.58s)]
*  They want to talk about this issue. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=153.02s)]
*  They want to make this front and center. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=154.62s)]
*  And while Democrats are optimistic about Florida, but temper that optimism saying that they [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  won't necessarily win the state on abortion, there is a feeling that this measure in Florida [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=162.7s)]
*  could very well pass. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=168.42s)]
*  And at the same time, Democrats could run up the score in Florida and sort of distract [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=170.1s)]
*  Republicans, making them spend more money on Florida because of the abortion issue and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=174.66s)]
*  essentially tying up their resources there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=180.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  Florida become very red in recent cycles, but if the GOP has to spend money there, that's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=184.1s)]
*  worth it in itself for Democrats. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=188.98s)]
*  So in your latest piece in the Hill, you report on how the Biden campaign is now starting [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=190.9s)]
*  to court Nikki Haley voters. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=195.78s)]
*  There have been some criticism. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=197.22s)]
*  They've been slow to do that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=198.1s)]
*  But how does abortion factor into those efforts, Julia? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=199.74s)]
*  Yeah, so in those efforts, it's interesting because when I was on the ground and particularly [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=203.82s)]
*  in New Hampshire, which Nikki Haley, she probably she did pretty well and she didn't win New [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=208.5s)]
*  Hampshire, but she came in second and was able to hold her own against former President [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=212.98s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=217.94s)]
*  There were a number of Haley supporters, Republican and independent that I chatted with, who said [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=218.94s)]
*  that they liked her stance on abortion, saying they liked that she said she wanted consensus [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=224.17999999999998s)]
*  on the issue, that this wasn't going to be decided at the federal level. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=230.1s)]
*  So she really took a step back as opposed to other Republicans like Ron DeSantis, who [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=234.62s)]
*  that six week abortion ban and question into law in Florida. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=240.18s)]
*  So I think a lot of Nikki Haley supporters might be more moderate on the issue as compared [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=244.46s)]
*  to Trump and Biden's campaign season opening there, particularly in the suburbs. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=250.58s)]
*  You know, over the past few election cycles, we've seen Democrats really run up the score [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=255.78s)]
*  with women, but also with suburban women in the suburbs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=261.22s)]
*  Abortion is an area where I think they feel they can do that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=264.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and you mentioned it. So key, Julia, suburban women. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=270.17999999999995s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about the Republicans ongoing struggles with that group. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=273.9s)]
*  So in terms of suburban women, we've seen Republicans struggling with that group, really [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  going back to 2018, the first election cycle, Donald Trump faced his first midterm cycle [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  as president. And the Republicans have continued to lose that group. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=291.54s)]
*  And when you look, you know, not only at the presidential level in 2020 when Biden was [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=296.7s)]
*  running against Trump, but in 2022, Republican Democrats were really able to run up the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=301.34s)]
*  score with the suburban women in various key states like Arizona, like Pennsylvania, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=307.34s)]
*  for example, 2020, Georgia, 2022 and Georgia Senate race, suburban women as well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=314.34s)]
*  So Republicans have been on the defense with this group, you know, mainly or one of the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=320.7s)]
*  main reasons is because of abortion. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=326.74s)]
*  We know that this group might have the tendency to sometimes lean more conservatively or [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=329.34s)]
*  somewhat right leaning when it comes to the economy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=334.86s)]
*  However, on these social issues and on Donald Trump himself, himself, you know, they're [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=337.26s)]
*  very much more likely to support Democrats or seem more likely to support Democrats. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=343.02s)]
*  So it's going to be an uphill climb for Republicans to cycle with this group. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=348.02000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate the analysis as always. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=352.54s)]
*  National politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester, thank you for joining us this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=355.06s)]
*  morning. Up next, we'll dig into Donald Trump's latest attempt to hijack Christian themes [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=359.1s)]
*  for his own political purposes and quest for power. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=365.62s)]
*  Elise Jordan will join us to discuss that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=369.66s)]
*  And then coming up on Morning Joe, the ex-president returns to the campaign trail with [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  stops in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=375.82s)]
*  And he once again railed against migrants and spread more election lies. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=379.17999999999995s)]
*  Plus, which battleground states now show President Biden and former President Trump in a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=384.9s)]
*  very tight race? We'll dig into those numbers and also ahead, actresses Gillian Anderson [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  and Billy Piper will be live in studio to talk about their upcoming Netflix film, Scoop. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geYlZczOuPk&t=395.58s)]
