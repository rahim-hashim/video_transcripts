# Why Pence believes he can paint a brighter future for GOP
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc)
*  Let's turn back to the 2024 campaign now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=0.0s)]
*  New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu has announced that he will not be making a run for the White [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=3.92s)]
*  House. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=8.88s)]
*  So we've taken the last six months to really kind of look at things where everything is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=10.88s)]
*  and I've made the decision not to run for president on the Republican ticket in 2024. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=14.52s)]
*  Obviously a lot goes into that decision, but it's been quite an adventure, but not the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=18.68s)]
*  end of the adventure by any means. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=22.84s)]
*  Governor Sununu went on to explain his decision in an op-ed for the Washington Post titled, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=25.88s)]
*  I'm not running for president in 2024. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=30.48s)]
*  Beating Trump is more important. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=33.72s)]
*  Governor writes in part this, our party is on a collision course toward electoral irrelevance [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=36.44s)]
*  without significant corrective action. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=42.36s)]
*  Current polls indicate Trump is the leading Republican candidate in 2024. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  He did not deliver on his promises to drain the swamp, secure the border and instill fiscal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=49.92s)]
*  responsibility while in office and added $8 trillion to our national debt. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=55.24s)]
*  Now he wants four more years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=60.32s)]
*  If he is the nominee, Republicans will lose again, just as we did in 2018, 2020 and 2022. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  Over the next few months, I will travel the country to bring on new voters, inspire the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  next generation and help grow our party. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  The stakes are too high for any of us to just sit on the sidelines. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=77.28s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics correspondent for Politico, Adam Ren. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=81.76s)]
*  Adam, good to see you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  So Governor Sununu is out, but the field has gotten pretty crowded. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  As we mentioned earlier in the show, former Vice President Mike Pence officially filed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=90.68s)]
*  his paperwork yesterday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  His campaign launch will be tomorrow. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  And this of course sets up a showdown with his former boss, Donald Trump. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=98.4s)]
*  Give us the Pence rationale. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=104.0s)]
*  What's his lane and how's he going to take on the former president? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=105.4s)]
*  Good to be with you, John. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=108.56s)]
*  The Pence folks see his lane as being the happy warrior in the race. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=111.16s)]
*  Right now, the frontrunners in the race are painting a pretty dark vision of the country. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=115.64s)]
*  People are coming after your families. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=121.84s)]
*  The world is an unsafe place. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=125.92s)]
*  And Pence really believes he can paint a brighter future for the GOP. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=127.72s)]
*  He's going to announce in Iowa, of course, and his campaign sees evangelical voter-rich [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=132.08s)]
*  Iowa as a place where he can really launch his campaign and connect with voters. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=137.32s)]
*  He's been there a lot already over the last two years. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=142.32s)]
*  He said he's going to visit all 99 counties. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=144.88s)]
*  And then he's going to head to New Hampshire, where he faces kind of a tougher path as a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  social conservative who advances a national ban on abortion. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  He's going to face a difficult path there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=159.64s)]
*  But in Iowa, he thinks he can really launch his campaign. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=161.56s)]
*  It should note that Pence was the only would-be candidate who actually hopped on the motorcycle [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=164.4s)]
*  in that Joni Ernst ride event from the other day. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=169.16000000000003s)]
*  How though is he going to take on Donald Trump, who of course he served so faithfully up until [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  the very end, only breaking with him on January 6th? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=178.0s)]
*  You know, John, he said that he's going to highlight the positive accomplishments of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  the Trump-Pence administration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=186.72000000000003s)]
*  He has dropped the Trump at times and talked about what he did as vice president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=189.8s)]
*  But I think it's really a matter of essentially calling out Trump by name on January 6th. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=196.0s)]
*  His campaign team believes that Trump faces some pretty difficult sledding when it comes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=204.12s)]
*  to his legal problems and that that could play a role in the race as things shake out. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=209.3s)]
*  At other times, Pence has been reluctant to take on Trump by name, calling him his former [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=215.82s)]
*  competitor. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=221.14s)]
*  He's focused on issues like reforming Social Security, cutting back spending on Social [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=222.14s)]
*  Security, and has called out his former running mate on issues of federal spending. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=227.06s)]
*  So we know that that's an issue where they disagree on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=232.82s)]
*  Also, of course, Ukraine. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=235.7s)]
*  When it comes to Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, Pence has really said that Ron [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  DeSantis is not a traditional economic conservative going too far in his battle with Disney. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=243.18s)]
*  And so Pence has said that he likes Walt Disney, not woke Disney. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=250.1s)]
*  So this is a former top radio show host. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=255.9s)]
*  He's pretty good with a one-liner, and I expect that to be part of his campaign. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=258.34s)]
*  So Adam, give us a sense of former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, not really focused [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=263.02s)]
*  on Iowa. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=267.46s)]
*  His attention is on New Hampshire. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=268.46s)]
*  That's where he tonight is going to announce his bid. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=269.94s)]
*  What is his path here outside of perhaps, as some of the party have suggested, that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=273.3s)]
*  he almost just exists as a flamethrower to try to take down other candidates? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=277.46s)]
*  He did it to Marco Rubio in 2016, maybe Trump this time around. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=281.78s)]
*  Yeah, it remains to be seen what his path is outside of New Hampshire. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=285.98s)]
*  He is sort of custom-built for New Hampshire, governor not far from a state of the way. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=290.9s)]
*  But he really is sort of the attack dog in this race. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=297.0s)]
*  Someone who can specifically litigate against Trump. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=299.86s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised to see him take on Pence as well and call out Pence for being [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=303.78000000000003s)]
*  what he might call him a hypocrite for enabling Trump all these years. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=307.82s)]
*  Of course, Pence famously took over the transition operation in 2016 from Chris Christie, who [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=312.42s)]
*  was running it until Pence was picked vice president. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=319.3s)]
*  So we could see some harsh words for Pence from Christie as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=321.58000000000004s)]
*  But yeah, Christie really relishes being the attack dog and is really kind of focused on [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=325.46s)]
*  litigating the case specifically against Trump in a way no other competitor seems to be comfortable [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=332.29999999999995s)]
*  with at this point in the race. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=338.5s)]
*  We should also note, of course, that Christie himself was very supportive of Trump up until [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  about January 6, even being part of his debate prep team. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=345.26s)]
*  National politics correspondent for Politico, Adam Wren. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=349.78s)]
*  Great stuff this morning. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=352.34s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLVCrrAKYZc&t=353.34s)]
