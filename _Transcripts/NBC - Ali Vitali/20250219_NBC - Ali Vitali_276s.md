# Trump signs executive order on IVF treatments
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ)
*  President Trump has signed an executive order calling for lower costs and expanded access [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to in vitro fertilization or IVF. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=5.64s)]
*  The order recommends reduced costs for accessing the decades old infertility treatment, which [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=8.72s)]
*  can range from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=13.24s)]
*  The treatment is often not covered by health insurers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=17.56s)]
*  The Department of Health and Human Services say more than 85,000 infants were born as [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=20.8s)]
*  a result of IVF in just 2021 alone. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  While campaigning, Trump promised to have the government or insurance companies cover [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=28.76s)]
*  the cost of IVF without specifying how that proposal would work. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=32.2s)]
*  Joining us now, reporter covering politics and reproductive health for the news publication [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=36.52s)]
*  Notice, Oriana Gonzalez. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=40.52s)]
*  Oriana, the White House is now calling this a first step in fulfilling that campaign promise [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=42.32s)]
*  from the president. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=47.6s)]
*  But talk about the significance of this order and what exactly it calls for, because to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=48.6s)]
*  my reading, it still doesn't lay out a plan for how this is going to go. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=52.92s)]
*  It just directs people to look into that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=56.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=59.12s)]
*  No, precisely. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=60.12s)]
*  So it falls short from that campaign promise that he made, as you were saying, to have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=61.12s)]
*  either the government pay for IVF or ensure or make sure that insurers are covering it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=65.32s)]
*  What this does instead is direct the domestic policy council to investigate ways to either [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=70.72s)]
*  make IVF more affordable and protected. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=76.68s)]
*  And what we're waiting for now is that that those policy recommendations from the domestic [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=79.6s)]
*  policy council will come in 90 days or within 90 days of the order being placed. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=84.28s)]
*  So that's really when we're going to have to see exactly whether how how those promises [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=90.0s)]
*  will be fulfilled. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=95.6s)]
*  Because you're such an expert on these issues. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=97.64s)]
*  How much can Trump really do on the cost of IVF? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=99.4s)]
*  And is he going to need Congress to help him on this? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=103.0s)]
*  That's I mean, that is the million dollar question, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=106.6s)]
*  Like force a mandate like the one that he was saying in his promise. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=109.08s)]
*  He does need Congress in order to be able to make that sort of promise that insurers [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=112.24s)]
*  are going to be required to do it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=117.36s)]
*  But what we've seen from the Trump administration in the first month is this, you know, decided [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=119.24s)]
*  to challenge the status quo. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=123.6s)]
*  So again, we're going to have to wait and see what the domestic policy council finds. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=126.22s)]
*  But when it comes to sort of like these policy mandates, whether insurers are required to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  cover or not, that's supposed to come from an act of Congress. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  And so far, to be honest, what I've heard from Republicans is that, well, at the time [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=138.24s)]
*  last week, they hadn't seen the proposal. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=142.5s)]
*  They believe that most of the conference in the Senate and in the House support measures [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=145.18s)]
*  to protect IVF. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  It's a pretty striking thing for Republicans to say, though, especially because I remember [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=152.82000000000002s)]
*  about a year ago, I was asking Nikki Haley, who at that point was running for the Republican [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  if a ruling in Alabama that assigned personhood rights to embryos created through IVF. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=163.48s)]
*  Did she agree with that? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  There were some Republicans who shared her positions that embryos are babies. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=170.83999999999997s)]
*  That was her quote. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump, of course, distanced himself from that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  But it really touched off this circle of Republicans having to respond to the fact that in some [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=177.64s)]
*  ways IVF is directly in contrast with their anti-abortion position. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, how have they reconciled that or have they? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=188.2s)]
*  I think at the time, they were really caught off guard with that Alabama ruling. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  So what we saw from Republicans definitely was scrambling to figure out how to respond [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=196.24s)]
*  to that, given, again, how reproductive health was such a big messaging tool for Democrats. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=200.36s)]
*  But what we're seeing now, I think, with Trump calling himself the father of IVF during [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=206.56s)]
*  the campaign trail, making promises about protecting IVF, about covering costs, is really [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=211.4s)]
*  Republicans in Congress falling in line with what he's saying. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's kind of, you know, it gets to the point of how much influence and power the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=220.6s)]
*  president has over Republicans in Congress. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  We shall see, though, exactly what happens in three months, once the—or within three [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=229.28s)]
*  months once those policy recommendations come in and whether Congress is required to act, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=234.16s)]
*  because that could be one of the recommendations that the Domestic Policy Council makes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=240.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be huge. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=244.32s)]
*  And it would mark some major shifts for Republicans if they're just willing to get on board with [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=246.36s)]
*  this now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  Oriana Gonzalez, we'll definitely have you back to talk about that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=254.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJvZTAIuKQ&t=255.68s)]
