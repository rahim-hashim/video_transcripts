# Congressman Says District Mixed On Impeachment | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og)
*  Well, I think it was a dramatic success in historical terms. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, it was the largest impeachment conviction vote in U.S. history. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=4.68s)]
*  It was by far the most bipartisan majority that's ever assembled in the Senate to convict [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=9.92s)]
*  a president, which has traditionally been a kind of partisan thing in American history. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=17.64s)]
*  We got seven Republicans. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=22.28s)]
*  And if you look at the 10 Republicans in the House who joined us, it was by far the most [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=23.76s)]
*  bipartisan decision and a complete repudiation of the president's conduct. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=29.14s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, it didn't reach the two-thirds majority in the Senate. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=35.9s)]
*  We're explaining this to foreign journalists who can't understand why he wasn't convicted [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  with a 57 to 43 vote, a 14 vote margin. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=44.82s)]
*  Well, you need two-thirds. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=47.7s)]
*  But I think that we successfully prosecuted him and convicted him in the court of public [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  opinion and in the court of history. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=54.84s)]
*  He's obviously a major political problem for the Republican Party. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=57.34s)]
*  And as long as he's out there attempting to wage war on American constitutional democracy, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=61.540000000000006s)]
*  he's a problem for all of us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=65.86s)]
*  I can completely understand why foreign journalists would have trouble wrapping their heads around [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=69.9s)]
*  this process. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=73.86s)]
*  That was lead House impeachment manager, Congressman Jamie Raskin, in an exclusive interview over [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=74.86s)]
*  the weekend with Meet the Press. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=79.06s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=80.98s)]
*  Congressman Lamb, it's great to see you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=83.78s)]
*  I'm not sure we've spoken at length since I was covering your special election race [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=86.58s)]
*  in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=91.86s)]
*  And I know some of the lines have changed since we last had that conversation, but you're [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=92.86s)]
*  still in a part of the state where you're likely hearing from a lot of voters who have [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  perhaps different opinions about what the House should have done about Donald Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=102.28s)]
*  And I'm interested to know what you are hearing from them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=107.66s)]
*  Do you feel like your constituents are anxious to move on from what happened on January 6th [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=111.42s)]
*  and away from the Trump era? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=117.78s)]
*  Or are they still angry and frustrated that he hasn't been held accountable? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=119.34s)]
*  I think it's a mix. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=124.86s)]
*  But for people who are in the middle or maybe a little bit right of center, I think there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=126.1s)]
*  was kind of a double burden in this trial to show why is impeachment necessary? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=130.86s)]
*  Why are you guys still focused on this? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=136.3s)]
*  It's over. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=137.94s)]
*  Do your job, legislate, bring us some more COVID relief aid or whatever. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=139.42s)]
*  And you showed Jamie's clip before I came on. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=144.54s)]
*  I just think he did an incredible job satisfying both burdens. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=147.3s)]
*  He continually returned to how serious this attack was on our democracy, everything that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=151.94s)]
*  it represented, why accountability is necessary. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=158.02s)]
*  And the result that he got of seven Republicans in the Senate and 10 Republicans in the House [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=161.5s)]
*  is unprecedented. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=166.4s)]
*  And it validates why we need to commit to our institutions and the democratic process, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=167.4s)]
*  because although it is slow and painful, we got real results at the end of the day. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=173.6s)]
*  And the nation, I think, understands better now what it is we're up against going forward. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  We were talking earlier in the show with Brez about all the security around the Capitol [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=184.16s)]
*  and also the personal security threats I know a lot of your colleagues are facing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=189.08s)]
*  What's that like behind the scenes for you? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=194.48s)]
*  Have you noticed an uptick in violent rhetoric directed at you? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=196.84s)]
*  And what do you think we do to try and ratchet that down? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=200.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as you probably remember from three years ago, I've had a fair amount of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  violent rhetoric directed at me from the first campaign I ever ran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=209.56s)]
*  So it hasn't been too different for me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=213.28s)]
*  To me, I think that it is significant, but it also carries with it a real risk, which [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=216.36s)]
*  is that we don't want the American people to believe we are more focused on ourselves [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=221.84s)]
*  internally and on our own security and needs than we are on them and their safety and security. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=227.56s)]
*  And I think one of the points that Jamie and others made throughout this trial was the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  way that an attack like January 6th poses a threat to everyone in this country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  If we don't respond to it and politics just becomes ruled by the most violent and the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  best liars, that's not going to work out for the average person in the middle class. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  The whole reason we have a democracy is to try to make sure the average person's interest [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  ends up being represented. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  And so I think it's sort of incumbent on all of us now, despite the fact that we have these [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=257.32s)]
*  new threats and security needs personally, to continue to show the American people that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=261.84s)]
*  this response we're making is about them and it's about their government, that we work [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=267.48s)]
*  for them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=271.8s)]
*  And that's a challenge in these times because of the misinformation that's out there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=272.8s)]
*  But I think the managers did a great job at it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=276.56s)]
*  That's a great it's a great point about the focus on folks who are so worried, have so [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=281.64s)]
*  many reasons to be focused on their own safety and security, economic and otherwise. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  Congressman, I have to ask you while I've got you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  We learned John Fetterman jumping into the Pennsylvania Senate race to replace Pat Toomey. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=291.79999999999995s)]
*  Are you considering running for Senate coming up ahead here? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  I will look at it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  I think for me, it's about the work. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=303.2s)]
*  I really feel lucky to get to serve in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=306.08s)]
*  and try to have an impact on some legislation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=309.2s)]
*  And I'll spend some time trying to figure out where can I do that most effectively and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  where can I help people? Thankfully, right now, I think we're doing a lot in the House. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=317.84s)]
*  This COVID-19 bill that we parked up through committee last week is significant. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=321.88s)]
*  It's really going to help a lot of people and I'm proud to be part of it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=326.84s)]
*  So, you know, my focus is there at the moment. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=329.12s)]
*  Does Chuck Schumer want you to run? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=334.28s)]
*  You have to ask him that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=336.84s)]
*  I haven't spoken to him about it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  All right, Congressman Conor Lamb, thank you very much. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  We really appreciate you getting up early here, for sure. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you very much for being with us and have a great rest of your week. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWmCTh-8Og&t=347.96s)]
