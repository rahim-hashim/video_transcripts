# McCarthy supports expunging Trump's impeachments
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0)
*  Welcome back. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he supports the resolutions to expunge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's impeachments. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=6.4s)]
*  the measures last week. Trump of course was impeached not once but twice during his time [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=11.56s)]
*  in office. The first was in a 29-day attempt to shake down Ukraine for political dirt on [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=16.56s)]
*  Joe Biden. Trump was then impeached again in 2021 for his actions ahead of and on January [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=22.12s)]
*  6th and the insurrection. McCarthy told NBC News that Trump should never have been impeached, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=28.84s)]
*  citing the Durham report, which raised questions about the FBI's investigation into the Trump [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=33.64s)]
*  campaign's ties with Russia. Take a listen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, the news channel, the proposal by Ms. Greene and Stefano are expunging from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=41.64s)]
*  the record, and is that something that House should really be doing? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=48.28s)]
*  Well, this is great. This is a great question because now we find out with Durham and the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  others that the impeachment never should have happened. We find when Durham came to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=57.24s)]
*  do it... In what way does Durham indicate the impeachment [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  shouldn't have happened? Exactly what he said, that they said they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=64.84s)]
*  shouldn't have gone forward with it based upon the information that they had, that they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=67.72s)]
*  knew the information wasn't true. Donald Trump wasn't impeached on anything [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  related to Durham using the somebody he had framed and using impeachment in January 6th. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=74.36s)]
*  So nothing to do with Durham. Now calm down. They started at the very beginning. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=78.04s)]
*  Okay, are you done asking questions so I can answer? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=83.32s)]
*  He asked the question. You both interrupted on that basis. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=87.08s)]
*  So I'll answer all your questions all the time, but don't interrupt me when I'm answering. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=89.72s)]
*  Okay? Is that a fair way to do it? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=93.0s)]
*  So when you find out what happened, they moved impeachment to end it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=97.88s)]
*  They accused the President Trump at the very beginning of Russia collusion. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=103.32s)]
*  You found from every action of what they did, especially adding ship lines to the American [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=108.6s)]
*  public, I think it is appropriate just to look at it from the floor. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=113.08s)]
*  And you should expect this to be... Kevin McCarthy, calm, cool, and collected, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=115.8s)]
*  as always. Joining us now, former aide to the George W. Bush White House and State Departments, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=121.0s)]
*  Elise Jordan. She's of course an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=125.72s)]
*  So Elise, I'm not even sure you can expunge impeachments. We'd have to bring up some lawyers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=128.84s)]
*  There you go. So that's that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=134.44s)]
*  But let's talk about the politics of it. What's the point here? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=136.28s)]
*  And is this going to win the Republican Party a single independent vote next year? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=140.68s)]
*  I mean, of course not. It won't win a single independent vote, but that's not who they are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=145.32s)]
*  pandering to. They're pandering to an audience of one, Donald Trump, and then two, to the Republican [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=150.28s)]
*  primary electorate. And it's unfortunate there are so many things and so many problems that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=156.2s)]
*  GOP policymakers in the House could address. But instead, they're wasting time on just this... [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  It's just a show. It's just a farce, and it's stupid, and a complete waste of time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=167.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to imagine this going much beyond a headline or two here. But it does, to your point, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=172.36s)]
*  show just the tightness still, the grip that Trump has on this party. And we looked at some [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=177.56s)]
*  poll numbers a little earlier on the show that since the second indictment, this one, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=183.4s)]
*  the federal indictment, his popularity among Republicans has only gone up. His lead over [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=188.44s)]
*  DeSantis has only grown. As voters have gotten to be a little more familiar, Republican primary [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=193.32s)]
*  voters, with DeSantis, he hasn't really popped. He peaked a little bit too early. And then you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=198.52s)]
*  have Donald Trump, who the support is there. It never really faded that much to begin with. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=203.8s)]
*  And the fact that he is perceived as under attack by the deep state, it only serves to further [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=209.64s)]
*  strengthen him. And we have just seen those numbers continue to go up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=215.72s)]
*  Yeah, and he gave a big speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference this weekend, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=218.76s)]
*  and the grievance and the sort of martyrdom was a big part of that. And that's obviously [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=222.28s)]
*  always been a huge part of his political persona. But at the same time, the poll suggests [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=226.2s)]
*  that even though his numbers with Republicans have gone up, that more and more voters overall, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  including Republican voters, are saying that, well, we do worry, though, that he could have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=235.64s)]
*  trouble winning a general election. And that's been the issue the whole time. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=240.44s)]
*  Well, absolutely. It seems to be something that's not much concern to Donald Trump right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=244.52s)]
*  He'll fight, perhaps, through another means. You look at how he still never conceded the 2020 [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=249.72s)]
*  election. He very well could just make this scorched earth and just make this all about [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=256.6s)]
*  sowing distrust among the electorate about the validity of any election result. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=262.52s)]
*  And depressed vote turnout, there's a lot that could be done. File so many lawsuits that it just [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=266.84000000000003s)]
*  overheats the tenor so much that you look at Republican voters who are already distrusting [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=273.32s)]
*  the system because of what Donald Trump has purported over these last couple of years. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=280.28s)]
*  They really aren't going to trust the system if he goes fully scorched earth. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=285.8s)]
*  The poll suggests that he and President Biden are in a tight race, Biden slightly above, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=289.8s)]
*  in a potential general election matchup. The White House is trying to do something pretty [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=294.6s)]
*  clear here, subtle but clear. And they're just kind of keeping their head down. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=299.0s)]
*  The president, they've announced a week's worth of economic events, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=302.28s)]
*  including a major speech in Chicago on Wednesday. They're also, of course, subtly pointing to the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=305.4s)]
*  situation in Russia, saying, hey, it's been President Biden's leadership on the world stage [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=311.08s)]
*  that helped create this chaos here. Can you imagine what it would be like if Donald Trump [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=314.52s)]
*  had been in charge? Do you think this is the right approach here for the Trump White House [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=318.52s)]
*  at this moment in the campaign? I actually think that playing up the economy is a good thing for [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=322.44s)]
*  Joe Biden right now. I frankly expected we would be in a deep, deep recession right now, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=327.08s)]
*  and I'm surprised that things are humming along the way that they are. And if this holds into [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  the reelection year, it's a very good thing for him. It makes it harder for Donald Trump to beat [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=336.44s)]
*  him. You go back to our voters also going to be reminded of just the general chaos of Donald Trump, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=341.0s)]
*  and that was one of the reasons that you saw some independents shift over, shift back to Biden. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=347.24s)]
*  And we're going to see just full-on chaos from now until 2024. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=351.88s)]
*  And just like in 2020, that poll suggests voters who kind of dislike both candidates are still [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=357.48s)]
*  breaking for Biden, and that could be the difference. Elise Jordan, stick around for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=362.92s)]
*  Morning Joe. Thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRc4r1NiAE0&t=367.88s)]
