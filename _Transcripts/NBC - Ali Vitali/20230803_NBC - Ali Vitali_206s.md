# Obama promises to help Biden win reelection in 2024
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo)
*  Welcome back. Former President Barack Obama is gearing up for a bruising election season, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=0.0s)]
*  and he says he's committing to help in any way he can to secure President Biden another [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=5.44s)]
*  term in office. That commitment came when Obama made a trip to the White House to have [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=10.56s)]
*  lunch with Biden back in June, according to three sources familiar with the meeting, The [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=14.76s)]
*  Washington Post first broke. Obama and Biden had a private lunch during which they discussed [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=18.96s)]
*  the 2024 election and particularly the surprising and resilient strength of former President [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=25.32s)]
*  Trump's base. Obama reportedly cited the increased political polarization of the country [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=31.0s)]
*  and stressed he was not concerned about Biden or the strength of his candidacy, but rather [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  his worries are about Trump's continuing grip over the Republican Party. Joining us now, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=43.08s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning columnist and associate editor of The Washington Post, MSNBC political [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=49.32s)]
*  analyst and our dear friend Eugene Robinson. Great to see you this morning. Let's start there [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=54.76s)]
*  with that meeting. It has been a source of, let's be candid, some frustration among Democrats that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=59.0s)]
*  President Obama doesn't do more in election cycles. The Obama team pushes back and says, look, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=64.12s)]
*  he plays the role of the closer, that his appearances have so much power because he only [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=70.36s)]
*  shows up in those last couple weeks and drives home big events, really turns out the vote, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=76.84s)]
*  whips up the enthusiasm. What do you make of how Obama has contributed to democratic efforts so [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=81.96s)]
*  far and do you agree with his worries about the strength of Trump? Well, number one, I think the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=87.32s)]
*  headline from that meeting is that Obama's not going to just come in to pits the ninth inning. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  He's going to be, you know, more of a middle reliever and a closer. He's coming in early and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=97.96s)]
*  I think that's significant news for the Biden campaign because obviously Barack Obama is a major, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=105.64s)]
*  major political force, especially in the Democratic Party, but also with independence, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=114.36s)]
*  with people who remember the Obama years as normal and better than the Trump years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=121.88s)]
*  And so I think that's good news for President Biden. You know, as far as his concerns about [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=129.56s)]
*  the polarization, the continuing strength of Trump within the Republican Party, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=136.68s)]
*  I don't think that's new. I think Joe Biden probably understands that, certainly as well as, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=143.16s)]
*  or probably better than Barack Obama at this point. After all, he has run against Trump [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=149.08s)]
*  and beaten him, but it is significant that this major, major figure in our politics is going to be [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=155.64s)]
*  involved early and often. You know, Obama, the nation's most popular Democrat, perhaps rivaled [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=163.88s)]
*  only by his wife, Michelle. And I think it is interesting, even a few months ago, there almost [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=169.0s)]
*  seemed to be a little bit of overconfidence among some people in Bidenland about their chances of a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  rematch against Trump. That's changed a little bit. I think they now realize, hey, look, we like our [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=178.04s)]
*  chances, we like our record, but Trump could win, and this is going to be a lot of work. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwUo_BSAkUo&t=182.04s)]
