# What's At Stake In Pennsylvania Following Supreme Court's Ruling
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0)
*  Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, The Washington Post reports that frustration is growing among Democrats about perceived inaction from the top of the party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Post writes, quote, To an increasingly vocal group of frustrated Democrats, responses by party leaders have been strikingly inadequate to meet a moment of crisis. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=12.0s)]
*  They criticize the notion that it is on voters to turn out in November when they say Democrats are unwilling to push boundaries and upend the system in defense of hard won civil liberties. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=22.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=32.0s)]
*  I want to get to what more the Democratic Party could do in a minute, Congresswoman, but I just came back. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=36.0s)]
*  I spent the day yesterday in Pittsburgh with an abortion provider who is pointing out how critical Pennsylvania now is in this abortion battle. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=40.0s)]
*  She's already seeing a flood of extra people coming in from Ohio, West Virginia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=50.0s)]
*  But Pennsylvania itself could lose its right to abortions in these midterm elections if the Democrats don't keep the governor's mansions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=54.0s)]
*  What are the stakes in in Pennsylvania at the moment? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=64.0s)]
*  The stakes are extremely high. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=68.0s)]
*  I'm glad to be with you this morning. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=70.0s)]
*  I actually spoke with Governor Wolf yesterday about this and other issues. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=72.0s)]
*  Thanks to Governor Wolf, he has been the backstop to protect women and girls' rights to their private health care decisions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=77.0s)]
*  We have a Republican-led Senate in Pennsylvania legislature, Republican-led House. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=85.0s)]
*  I was there for six and a half years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=92.0s)]
*  Over and over, they would try to introduce half bills that would restrict a woman's right to her own private decisions around health care. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=95.0s)]
*  So without Governor Wolf, we would be in a very sorry state. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=104.0s)]
*  But I do want to remind folks in Pennsylvania, abortion is legal in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=108.0s)]
*  But to your point, it is critical, this governor's election, that we elect Josh Shapiro because Josh Shapiro, who is currently our attorney general, has consistently upheld a woman's right to privacy and her health care choices. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=114.0s)]
*  Doug Mastriano, the election denier, who famously or infamously sold tickets to and participated in the January 6th insurrection, hears nothing for women's rights, does not even believe in abortion services and care in the event of the extreme cases of incest or life of the mother. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=128.0s)]
*  So everything is on the line. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=150.0s)]
*  We have to elect Josh Shapiro governor to be that veto pen, to be that backstop. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=152.0s)]
*  Critically important, as you know, is our Senate race here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=158.0s)]
*  Senator Toomey is not seeking reelection. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=162.0s)]
*  John Fetterman is running and is the Democratic nominee. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=164.0s)]
*  He, too, will protect a woman's right to choose. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=168.0s)]
*  We have to pick up at least two more Democratic senators to break through the filibuster in the Senate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=170.0s)]
*  So all eyes will be on Pennsylvania for elections up and down the ballot to continue to protect a woman's right to choose. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=177.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania really has become the front line in the abortion battle. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=184.0s)]
*  But to that point that the Washington Post is talking about amongst progressives, that there's some frustration that Democrats are just being told, look, this is on you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=188.0s)]
*  You've got to turn out and vote in November. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=197.0s)]
*  And that's pretty much all we can do. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=199.0s)]
*  Is that is that a fair criticism of the administration? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=201.0s)]
*  Could more be being done here in Washington? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=204.0s)]
*  I'm not sure that it's a fair criticism of the administration. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=207.0s)]
*  It is a reflection of the times we are in. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=211.0s)]
*  I talk to voters all week and long at rallies and yes, to a person, we're tired. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=214.0s)]
*  But elections matter. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=220.0s)]
*  This is exactly when it is important that we not fatigue, that we not give up, that we not lose hope. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=222.0s)]
*  Because really simply this is a legislative matter and we need to make it that you know, back in September, daddy, the House, the U.S. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=228.0s)]
*  House cast protection of Roe v. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=236.0s)]
*  Wade, the codification of Roe v. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=239.0s)]
*  Wade. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=241.0s)]
*  We now simply have to stand with that decision and make sure that the Senate will actually uphold it, too. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=242.0s)]
*  We are the legislative branch. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=249.0s)]
*  This corrupt Supreme Court with three members being seated by the most corrupt criminal president the United States has ever seen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=251.0s)]
*  They must not have the last word on our rights. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=261.0s)]
*  And what they've done when you think of how cynical it is, they claim to have sent this back to the states. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=265.0s)]
*  And as I said, it's still legal here in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=272.0s)]
*  Please don't anybody be misguided there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=275.0s)]
*  They sent it back to the states. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=279.0s)]
*  What they did was to say that our health care choices, my daughters and my granddaughters health care choices are now in the hands of politicians. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=281.0s)]
*  How cynical we must never let that happen. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=290.0s)]
*  And when when in the Washington Post reporting and you've got some progressives saying that the party leadership could be more creative or push more boundaries. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=294.0s)]
*  Is there anything Democratic leadership? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=304.0s)]
*  Are there any tools at the party's disposal that it could use that are not being used at the moment beyond getting out the vote? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=307.0s)]
*  I hope that the administration will continue to speak loudly and firmly against this decision by the Supreme Court. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=316.0s)]
*  We'll continue to talk about what we need to break through is the filibuster where minority rule keeps us in just in terrible straits. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=326.0s)]
*  Frankly, the founders never anticipated that a minority would govern the day. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=336.0s)]
*  And so I hope the administration will continue to speak out, do anything in its power by way of executive orders to protect women's rights. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=343.0s)]
*  This decision really, it is so sickening and corrupt. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=353.0s)]
*  It really relegates women and girls to second class citizen status. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=358.0s)]
*  The administration must continue to say that and say we will never stand for it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=363.0s)]
*  Strong language. Congresswoman Madeline Dean from Pennsylvania. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=368.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=371.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM_IEL_eiD0&t=382.0s)]
