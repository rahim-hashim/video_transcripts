# Marco Rubio and Mike Lee endorse Trump after dissing him in 2016
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds)
*  Welcome back. More congressional Republicans are coming out in support of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's presidential campaign, even those who were against his candidacy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=4.36s)]
*  back during the 2016 race. Ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Senator Marco Rubio of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=9.28s)]
*  Florida and Senator Mike Lee of Utah both endorsed the former president [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=15.48s)]
*  with Rubio arguing, quote, it's time to get on with the work of beating Biden and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=20.16s)]
*  save America. Lee urged his voters to cast their ballots for Trump, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=24.68s)]
*  regardless of whether they agree with everything he says or not. But [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=29.52s)]
*  interestingly, both were singing a decidedly different tune back in 2016. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=33.92s)]
*  Take a listen. If anyone spoke to my wife or my daughter or my mother or any [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=39.4s)]
*  of my five sisters, the way Mr Trump has spoken to women, I wouldn't hire that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=44.64s)]
*  person. I wouldn't hire that person, wouldn't want to be associated with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=51.64s)]
*  that person. And I certainly don't think I'd feel comfortable hiring that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=56.58s)]
*  person to be the leader of the free world. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=61.54s)]
*  Donald Trump has been perhaps the most vulgar. No, I don't think perhaps the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=65.42s)]
*  most vulgar person ever aspire to the presidency in terms of how he's carried [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=69.22s)]
*  out his candidacy. There is no way we're going to allow a con artist to take [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=72.82s)]
*  over the conservative movement. And Donald Trump is a con artist. He [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=76.78s)]
*  doesn't sweat. He doesn't sweat because his pores are clogged from the spray [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=80.22s)]
*  tan that he uses. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=83.62s)]
*  Donald is not going to make America great. He's going to make America orange. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=86.58s)]
*  How things have changed. Joining us now communication strategist and former [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=100.66s)]
*  aid to house speakers Ryan and Boehner, Brandon Buck. He is an MSNBC political [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=105.22s)]
*  analyst. Brandon, good to see you. I mean, it's not even a surprise. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=110.18s)]
*  Republicans come running back to Trump. Those who once were critical of him. So [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=114.58s)]
*  very few have stayed steadfast in opposing him. But you know, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=118.58s)]
*  congressional endorsements sometimes matter, and a whole bunch of them have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=122.58s)]
*  come out for Trump in recent days, including these two who once opposed [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=125.62s)]
*  him. What do you make of these? The timing of these endorsements? What kind [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=129.82s)]
*  of messages to send? But really, what does it tell us about the party? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=133.54s)]
*  Yeah, a few things. I mean, I don't think in congressional endorsements [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=137.28s)]
*  themselves matter that much. What they tell you, though, is that these are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=140.5s)]
*  politicians who do polls in their in their states or their districts, and they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=143.42s)]
*  see what I think all of us are seeing, that this is Donald Trump's party still, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=146.94s)]
*  and there's no real use in fighting it. We've had a primary here where Ron [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=150.26s)]
*  DeSantis, I think, wanted to move us past Trump and give you a lot of what Trump [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  is, maybe a little less crazy, a little more boring. And voters don't want that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=158.89999999999998s)]
*  And you got Nikki Haley, who maybe wants to go back to a party that we had 10, 15 [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  years ago. Voters don't want that. And that's what these senators and House [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=167.89999999999998s)]
*  members are seeing, that this is where the party is firmly still a Trump party. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=172.46s)]
*  Doing it at this late date, I think, basically tells us what we're going to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=177.74s)]
*  find out tonight, that this primary is over. It was probably over before it began. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  There's not a real competitive primary here. They understand that Nikki Haley and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=184.94s)]
*  Ron DeSantis had their shot. It's not going to work out. And so they're trying [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=188.78s)]
*  to get ahead of that. Yeah. And let's let's spend a moment on on that idea [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=192.02s)]
*  that certainly there's been a lot of coverage about the jockeying about who's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=196.22s)]
*  in second, who's in third. And we're going to spend time on that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=200.54s)]
*  But but there has been this sort of overarching thought throughout that there [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  really wasn't a primary here. Trump's up huge. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  Like, that's going to be our takeaway tonight, no matter who finishes second, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=209.54s)]
*  no matter whether DeSantis can move on to New Hampshire or South Carolina or not. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=212.34s)]
*  It's really that Trump won and Trump's probably going to win big. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=216.18s)]
*  And I know there's some turnout concerns because of the weather. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  But just do you see anything other than that being the takeaway tonight? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  Is Trump in a rout? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  He's going to win big without even having to do real campaigning. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=228.82s)]
*  And this is a primary unlike we've ever seen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  He didn't do any debates. He's barely showed up in Iowa. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=235.18s)]
*  Ron DeSantis has basically lived for a few months and he's going to to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  to smoke him in the caucus. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=241.98s)]
*  So, yeah, you talk usually about who, you know, who comes in comes in second, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  maybe who comes in third out of Iowa. That's if it's close. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=248.62s)]
*  This is probably not going to be anywhere near close. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=252.34s)]
*  And so at this point, you have to ask the question to certainly Ron DeSantis, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=254.62s)]
*  but even Nikki Haley, if she looks good in New Hampshire, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=258.54s)]
*  what is your plausible case for winning the nomination coming out of here? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  If you're losing by 30 points in Iowa [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=266.66s)]
*  and you're going into Nevada and South Carolina, where polling shows [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  you're doing even worse there, how do you continue asking donors for money? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=273.02000000000004s)]
*  How do you look at this party and think what you represent [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=277.22s)]
*  is actually what they're looking for? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=280.3s)]
*  Trump won without even having to really do much of anything. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=282.06s)]
*  So let's talk about the very, very narrow path that Nikki Haley might have, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  because I think she is the one candidate who has at least a little bit of momentum [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=289.34s)]
*  and at least a plausible, plausible, if unlikely, scenario. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=293.06s)]
*  And that would be she did push the second tonight, you know, a distant second, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=297.02s)]
*  but but had a descent as DeSantis campaign more or less goes away after that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  She then, with the help of Chris Christie dropping out, maybe she then she wins [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=304.7s)]
*  and then has the buzz and the talk, like the consolidation of the never Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=309.02s)]
*  forces surround Haley with a few weeks before South Carolina. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=312.7s)]
*  But isn't the problem with that plan, what you just said, that though Haley, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=317.02s)]
*  South Carolina is her home state, she's distant, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=321.58s)]
*  distant in the polls behind Trump there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=325.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's she obviously represented there, but it's it's it's Trump country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=327.62s)]
*  It is it is the deep south. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=331.46s)]
*  It is where Trump base of support is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=333.09999999999997s)]
*  So the idea that she could turn that around, I don't really see that as plausible. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=336.38s)]
*  I mean, campaigns end when you run out of money usually. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=342.06s)]
*  And I just don't know how she turns to people and makes a case that she is now [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=345.54s)]
*  going to to flip this flip this state or any other state, frankly. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=349.62s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump has basically a national operation [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=354.26s)]
*  without having to really do much of anything. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=357.02s)]
*  These people have invested so much time and effort in these early states. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=358.74s)]
*  The idea that they can build out an operation from here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=362.42s)]
*  We remember when Joe Biden was able to turn around his fortunes in South Carolina. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=365.02s)]
*  That's when the whole party, the Democratic Party, turned [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=370.58s)]
*  and the establishment came around and rallied to his base. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=373.7s)]
*  Jim Clyburn bailed him out. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=376.34s)]
*  There's no establishment base to bail out Nikki Haley. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  There's no savior who can endorse her at this point and turn things around for her. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  So there were there are there are surprises that happen. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  There are upsets that happen. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  But we would be talking about an upset that we have never seen. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=389.73999999999995s)]
*  And there really just is no structure in place to create one. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPEolAaP-Ds&t=392.7s)]
