# Michigan's Sixth Congressional District Race Heats Up | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 25, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg)
*  On November 3rd, Michigan, you better vote for me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=0.0s)]
*  I got you so many damn car plants. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=3.64s)]
*  That was President Trump in Michigan earlier this month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=5.84s)]
*  And joining us now, someone else who's on the ballot in that state, John Hoadley, a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=12.64s)]
*  three term Michigan state representative. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=16.84s)]
*  He's considered the front runner in the highly contentious race for Michigan's sixth U.S. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=19.32s)]
*  congressional district, a longtime Republican stronghold currently occupied by 17 term incumbent [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=23.96s)]
*  congressman Fred Upton. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=29.88s)]
*  John, good morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=31.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for getting up early with us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=34.76s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about your district. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=35.76s)]
*  This is a place where, as we noted, a longtime Republican stronghold, but it's been changing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=39.64s)]
*  a little bit, perhaps a lot in terms of who lives there, what they care about. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=45.16s)]
*  And I'm particularly interested. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  You were endorsed by Joe Biden, who actually gave a speech, came under some criticism for [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=52.08s)]
*  a speech he gave that seems to support Fred Upton back before the last round of elections. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=56.56s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit about that Joe Biden endorsement and whether you think you might [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=63.6s)]
*  have a better shot this time of defeating Fred Upton with that help. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=68.88s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  It's so good to be here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=74.0s)]
*  And absolutely. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=75.0s)]
*  Southwest Michigan is changing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=76.0s)]
*  So my district is six counties in southwest Michigan from Kalamazoo, where I represent [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=78.38s)]
*  now as a state legislator over to Lake Michigan, down to Indiana and up to just south of Grand [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=82.88s)]
*  Rapids. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's one of the least gerrymandered districts in the state because the Republicans [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  in the legislature couldn't move Indiana or Lake Michigan. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=94.64s)]
*  And this is a district that has been rapidly trending towards the Democrats. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=97.96s)]
*  We're seeing a demographic change here and we're seeing people who want to see change [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=102.52s)]
*  in the type of politics and policies that their leaders are voting for. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=106.56s)]
*  Fred Upton has been in the seat for almost 34 years now and he has a track record of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=111.88s)]
*  voting against health care. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=117.8s)]
*  I'm someone that thinks that more people should have health care. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  And with this being a health care election, that makes a big difference. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=123.16s)]
*  And one of the things that has changed is that with Joe Biden's vice president, Joe [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=127.14s)]
*  Biden's recent endorsement of my run for Congress, it's just yet another example of where all [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=132.28s)]
*  the pieces are coming in line. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=138.72s)]
*  Congressman Upton was criticized previously because he sent out mailers that used some [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=141.32s)]
*  of vice president's words that may have implied an endorsement. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=146.6s)]
*  So this time it is crystal clear. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=149.96s)]
*  Vice President Joe Biden knows how important this race is for me to win and hold Democratic [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=152.48s)]
*  control of the Congress, but also how important this race is to make sure that Michigan as [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=158.2s)]
*  a whole votes blue. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=162.34s)]
*  So Michigan obviously narrowly did go for President Trump last time around and there [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=166.36s)]
*  has been, we joke a lot about Democrats being anxious about things on a national level, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  but there is definitely a little bit of hand wringing going on about the way the Biden [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=175.96s)]
*  campaign is running this time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious though, what your view is on President Trump. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  There obviously were a lot of Trump supporters in Michigan last time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=185.36s)]
*  He touched a nerve in appealing to people, especially who feel left behind by the way [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=188.28000000000003s)]
*  the economy has trended. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=193.52s)]
*  If you win in November and the president wins his election, do you see a world in which [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=197.24s)]
*  you can work with a President Trump come January? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=202.58s)]
*  As a state legislator, I've had to work in minority control in the legislature for the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=209.0s)]
*  last few years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  I've worked both with Democratic governors and Republican governors. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  At the heart of why I run to serve is because we need to put people in community at the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  center of those decisions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=222.88s)]
*  I want to make sure that anyone who's ready to get to work to help the district that I [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=225.04s)]
*  represent, our country, our state, that they're going to have a good person to work with and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=231.6s)]
*  me. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=235.92s)]
*  And here's the reality though. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=236.92s)]
*  Unfortunately, many of President Trump's policies have not helped us here in Southwest [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  And at times when congressmen could have stood up to actually take a stand on things like [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  health care that people in Southwest Michigan desperately need, he voted time and time again [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=251.84s)]
*  to take away health care. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=257.8s)]
*  We all know that there is an active Republican lawsuit that would dismantle the Affordable [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=260.48s)]
*  Care Act. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=265.52s)]
*  This seems to be something Congressman Upton would support because he literally had the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  Upton Amendment named after him that would have led to the dismantling of the Affordable [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=270.48s)]
*  Care Act but for Senator McCain's historic no vote. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=274.9s)]
*  So this is a ballot where voters in Southwest Michigan know that we need to see real change [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=278.76s)]
*  in this district and it's got to be focused on real working class people, the people that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  have been left behind by so many of President Trump's policies that have been supported [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=290.44s)]
*  by Brett Upton. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  All right, very, very quickly before I let you go, we've talked about Republicans and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=301.08s)]
*  Spartan or Wolverine? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=302.08s)]
*  Listen, I'm a graduate of Michigan State University. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  So go Spartans. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=307.52s)]
*  Not a partisanship one can change midway through an election or any other time in your life. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  John Holdley, candidate for Congress in Michigan's 6th District. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=316.08s)]
*  Thank you very much for getting us up early with us this morning. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anHVWbo1mVg&t=319.28s)]
