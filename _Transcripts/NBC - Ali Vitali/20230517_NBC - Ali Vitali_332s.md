# Trump, DeSantis spar over Florida's six-week abortion ban
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo)
*  Welcome back. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appears ready to finally draw some political [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=0.0s)]
*  battle lines with Donald Trump. One of them? Over abortion. It all started earlier this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=5.92s)]
*  week when the former president called Florida's six-week abortion ban harsh. That of course [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=10.68s)]
*  is the ban that Governor DeSantis recently signed into law. Trump said in an interview [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=16.68s)]
*  on Monday, quote, if you look at what DeSantis did, a lot of people don't even know if he [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=21.52s)]
*  knew what he was doing. But he signed six weeks and many people within the pro-life [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=27.22s)]
*  movement feel that was too harsh. During the CNN town hall last week, Trump declined to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=31.74s)]
*  detail what kind of federal action he would take on abortion if he were to be elected [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=38.06s)]
*  president again. DeSantis reacted to Trump's comments yesterday. Take a listen. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=42.26s)]
*  Protecting an unborn child when there's the detectable heartbeat is something that almost [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=49.46s)]
*  probably 99% of pro-life or support. It's something that other states like Iowa under [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=55.74s)]
*  Governor Kim Reynolds have enacted. And I think that as a Florida resident, you know, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  he didn't give an answer about would you have signed the heartbeat bill that Florida did [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=68.08s)]
*  that had all the exceptions that people talk about. The legislature put it in. I signed [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=74.04s)]
*  the bill. I was proud to do it. He won't answer whether he would sign it or not. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=78.76s)]
*  Trump responded to that by calling into Newsmax last night saying, I'm the one who got rid [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=84.86s)]
*  of Roe versus Wade. Joining us now, politics reporter for Semaphore, Shelby Tackett. Shelby, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  thanks for being here this morning. So let's talk about the politics of abortion here for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=96.78s)]
*  these two men. It's certainly a test. Trump is clearly trying to thread some sort of needle, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=101.3s)]
*  and it's not clear if he's doing it well. Do the DeSantis camp think this is an issue [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=107.62s)]
*  that can help them in the GOP primary? Yeah, I've talked to a lot of DeSantis allies and even [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=111.22s)]
*  some of his team members. And I think the big thing here is they believe that DeSantis will [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=115.78s)]
*  be successful against Trump if he hits him from the right. And so certainly a six week abortion [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=121.82s)]
*  ban at this point is hitting Trump from the right on the issue. Whether that works remains to be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=126.9s)]
*  seen. But that's certainly there. I believe going to be there, the crux of their campaign [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=133.3s)]
*  against the former president. It is interesting how DeSantis is taking on Trump from the right [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=139.58s)]
*  on a whole host of issues. And though the risk of that, of course, is that may end up backfire, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  hurting him in a general election were he to be the GOP nominee. But there's certainly the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=148.10000000000002s)]
*  rivalry between DeSantis and Trump has heated up. We expect DeSantis to jump in officially soon, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=152.34s)]
*  next couple of weeks. And you've got some new reporting about a battle over some endorsements. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=157.62s)]
*  Tell us about this crazy story. Yeah, so the endorsement battle has been heating up for [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=162.94s)]
*  weeks. Obviously, a few weeks ago, the former president really took it to DeSantis as he was [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=167.66s)]
*  here in Washington, D.C., and announced a whole slew of Florida endorsements kind of as a, you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  know, well, I'm winning in your home, in your home state. And the Florida governor hit back pretty [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=181.46s)]
*  quickly this weekend in Iowa with a impressive list of Iowa endorsements and then also in New [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=188.42s)]
*  Hampshire yesterday. And the New Hampshire one was really interesting because all of a sudden, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=194.02s)]
*  some of the lawmakers who were on Governor DeSantis' list started saying, no, I'm actually [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=199.5s)]
*  endorsing the former president. And so there was this kind of battle between, okay, well, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=205.86s)]
*  who's endorsing who? One woman endorsed both of them at the same time. The other woman said, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  oh, no, Ron DeSantis is the super PAC supporting Ron DeSantis is just is playing games. And I'm [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=217.1s)]
*  actually supporting Trump. But then the super PAC came out with a piece of paper showing that she [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=225.66s)]
*  had also endorsed the Florida governor. And so it's just a complete mess on the endorsement front [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=231.01999999999998s)]
*  at this point. And these are to be clear, not national names, but in local politics, particularly [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=237.14s)]
*  in a state like New Hampshire, they carry some weight. But I'm pretty sure you're not allowed [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=242.14s)]
*  to endorse two people at once. So the race likely going to get more crowded soon. We mentioned DeSantis, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=245.82s)]
*  but Senator Tim Scott next week, I believe he's jumping in. We expect the vice president Pence [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=251.57999999999998s)]
*  will at some point walk us through your covering the Republican field so closely, just the shape [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=257.26s)]
*  of this and where these candidates think they can gain some momentum. Yeah, I mean, I think it [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=261.82s)]
*  depends on the candidate. So Tim Scott is probably going to be actually pretty similar to Mike Pence [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=266.7s)]
*  in the sense that he's going to be running on kind of this evangelical, very conservative, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=273.42s)]
*  social conservative message. And then you have Ron DeSantis, who's about to get in the race, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  who, as we just said, is going to be hitting Trump and probably some of the other lawmakers on the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=282.62s)]
*  right to every issue. So I think the bottom line in this race is, A, it's about to get pretty [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=287.26s)]
*  crowded. But B, it's going to be a race of who can get further to the right on various issues [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  against someone like Trump. We don't know yet if Trump will participate in the first [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=299.58s)]
*  Republican debates, which are slated for this summer. Politics reporter for Semaphore, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=304.78s)]
*  Shelby Tackett, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=309.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDOW2E5foo&t=329.58s)]
