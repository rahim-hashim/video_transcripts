# Trump claims Jan. 6 insurrectionists were 'set up' by Capitol police
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=0.0s)]
*  At his rally in Las Vegas yesterday, Donald Trump once again suggested that he would pardon [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=2.74s)]
*  the January 6th insurrectionists in a second term. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=7.28s)]
*  He deemed those insurrectionists hostages, victims, and warriors. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=10.98s)]
*  He also accused the Capitol Police, many of whom were brutalized during the attack, of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  setting up the rioters to be arrested. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=21.78s)]
*  We're going to do a lot of things. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=26.14s)]
*  We're going to look very strongly at J6. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=27.76s)]
*  Those people, there has never been people treated more horrifically than J6 hostages. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=29.66s)]
*  Those J6 warriors, they were warriors, but they were really more than anything else. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=37.76s)]
*  They're victims of what happened. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  All they were doing is protesting a rigged election. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=43.9s)]
*  That's what they were doing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=46.7s)]
*  And then the police say, go in, go in, go in. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=49.34s)]
*  Go on in, everybody, go on in. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=52.46s)]
*  What a setup that was. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=55.019999999999996s)]
*  What a horrible... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=56.7s)]
*  Joining us now, the host of the podcast, on brand with Donnie Deutsch. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=58.34s)]
*  Donnie Deutsch, making his way too early debut. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=62.82s)]
*  We will have him back frequently going forward. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=65.62s)]
*  15 years on the morning, Joe, working my way to this scene. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=67.86s)]
*  You finally made it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=70.7s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=71.7s)]
*  Made the big time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=72.7s)]
*  So Donnie, let's just start here with Donald Trump. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=73.7s)]
*  This is not a new refrain, him praising the January 6th insurrectionists, but now calling [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=76.34s)]
*  them heroes and contrasting them with the capital police, just a new low. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=83.22s)]
*  And also using the word hostages, you know, with what's going on in Israel, we've got [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=89.3s)]
*  hostages and what we all know all too well and how sadly, but to call these guys hostages [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=92.86s)]
*  ridiculous and the J6, all of a sudden now it's a thing. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=96.98s)]
*  He's branded it J6 and that the police said, come on in, come on in. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=100.32s)]
*  It's just as if videotape never existed. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=104.58s)]
*  It's as if we've never saw footage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=107.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=108.62s)]
*  It's just, it's just amazing how he can defy any sense of reality and his followers believe [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=110.38000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  And J6, the shorthanding it that way seems another moment where he's speaking to this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  like bubble, this ecosystem on the right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=120.02000000000001s)]
*  Expect this video to be played a lot between now and the election. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=123.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's, it's been a few years and we've got to just continue to refresh people's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  memories and when you see it, you just wonder how can anybody vote for this side, for this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=131.74s)]
*  who relishes these people, who calls these people champions, who calls these people heroes [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=137.46s)]
*  and patriots and victims and hostages. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=141.62s)]
*  And then you're staring at this and you go, what planet am I on? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=144.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=146.98s)]
*  And it's going to be really important for the Biden campaign and other Democrats to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=147.98s)]
*  just remind people what the Trump years were like, including how they ended. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=150.34s)]
*  The Biden, President Biden was in France for several days last week and his team really [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=155.42s)]
*  set about creating an implicit contrast with Donald Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=160.3s)]
*  Biden was there for all the D-Day events, praising alliances. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=164.18s)]
*  We know Trump has tried to sabotage NATO and other American alliances. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=166.7s)]
*  You know, President Biden reiterating commitment to Ukraine. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=170.22s)]
*  We know that Trump frequently backs Russia and not Kiev. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=172.74s)]
*  And then even yesterday, the President Biden was at the World War One cemetery that Trump, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=177.7s)]
*  when he was in office, skipped a ceremony there because it rained. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=182.14s)]
*  So do you think this kind of messaging, though, is breaking through? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=185.54s)]
*  Well, the Biden campaign is going to be about contrast. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=189.06s)]
*  They've been very, very clear about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=191.54s)]
*  It really lifts it up side by side. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=192.9s)]
*  One guy who is serious, one guy who is stands for all the kind of gravitas and all the great [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=195.14s)]
*  things that America is all about, and another guy who's about negativity and tearing it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  down. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=204.7s)]
*  And I think you're going to see a lot of this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=205.7s)]
*  One side talks about how America sucks and the other side talks about elevating America [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  and the greatness of America. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=211.26s)]
*  And I think that's a message that's going to resonate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=212.26s)]
*  So you're obviously an expert on branding and advertising and breaking through. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=214.06s)]
*  There was no doubt. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=217.14s)]
*  It was noted by several of the Biden camp in Wilmington, noted to me over the weekend [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=218.14s)]
*  that this Biden trip did break through. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=221.14s)]
*  But they acknowledge a lot of that is because, of course, the eyes of the world were going [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=223.06s)]
*  to be on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=226.06s)]
*  So they were very pleased how front and center the president was. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=228.08s)]
*  But talk to us about the challenge they're going to have keeping him front and center [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=231.22s)]
*  going forward. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=234.5s)]
*  Look, they have to. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=235.5s)]
*  You know, the American public has a great sense and a great sniff test. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=236.5s)]
*  And if all of a sudden he's not around and they're hiding him and they go, OK, oh, they'll [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  do certain kind of events and we're going to coddle him this way, he's got to be out [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=242.86s)]
*  there and he's got to be out there aggressive and front and center. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  This all, of course, leads up to June 27th in the debate, which is going to be huge. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  So president back on the world stage in just a few days. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=253.5s)]
*  He heads to Italy in the G7 later this week. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  So let's talk about about that debate. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's still three weeks or so off or two and a half weeks off. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=260.06s)]
*  He's got time to prepare. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=263.97999999999996s)]
*  What are some of the things you think he needs to accomplish that night? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=265.5s)]
*  I think two things have got to happen. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=267.9s)]
*  First and foremost, and it's not a close second, and this happened in the State of the Union. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=269.58s)]
*  He's got to answer the question of, is he too old? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=272.97999999999996s)]
*  Is he not there? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=275.94s)]
*  Does he not have his punch anymore? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=276.94s)]
*  Has he lost his fastball? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=277.94s)]
*  So a lot of it is going to be, I don't want to say substance over style, but he's going [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=279.02s)]
*  to have to come off as full of vigor and ready to go and answer that one, oh, well, you know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=283.5s)]
*  he's too old. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=290.14s)]
*  And just answer that off the bat the same way he did State of the Union. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=291.14s)]
*  And the second thing, and this is why this style plays to his favor without an audience. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=293.38s)]
*  It's really about content and it's really about who's got a better grip on things. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=299.68s)]
*  And I think Trump does not have the bells and whistles around him. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  So I think this plays to Biden. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=306.14s)]
*  But first and foremost, he's got to come off full of piss. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=307.18s)]
*  And as a last beat, you know Donald Trump for years here in New York. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=309.94s)]
*  He's got to sit for a probation officer interview today, something that, of course, he deeply [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=313.38s)]
*  detests. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  Just talk to us about how you think he'll take that and what sort of impact, you know, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=319.66s)]
*  sentencing month off, how is that weighing on him going forward and how that may impact [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=323.52s)]
*  what he says? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=327.26s)]
*  I think it is weighing on him. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=328.26s)]
*  And I think that obviously the sentencing is going to be interesting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=329.42s)]
*  I mean, most people don't think he's going to get prison sentenced, neither do I. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, you know, all this just just eats away at him. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=336.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm probably he'll be sitting there like this today at the probation meeting, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=339.1s)]
*  like we know his his court stance. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=341.98s)]
*  But he certainly ain't loving this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  And but the good news is he's back on the campaign trail saying the things he says. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=346.22s)]
*  So I think the great news about the trial was a guilty verdict and he's back out on [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=349.94s)]
*  the streets. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=354.82000000000005s)]
*  And the Biden team thinks that as well. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=355.26s)]
*  They think that actually the trial sheltered him. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=356.62s)]
*  Yes. And now that he's out and about, Americans will be listening to him again. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=358.58000000000004s)]
*  We turned off by what he says in the biggest moment for that to happen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=361.42s)]
*  The debate underscoring your point, just how large that looms. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=364.18s)]
*  Donnie Deutsch, thank you so much. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=367.06s)]
*  We will talk to you again a little later this morning on Morning Joe. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoRrqmFcms&t=368.26s)]
