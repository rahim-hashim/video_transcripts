# Democrats weigh strategy to counter Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA)
*  I have to tell you, I just watched President Trump's news conference. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen, it's one thing for Internet pundits to spew off conspiracy theories. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=11.32s)]
*  are still being recovered and families still being notified. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=18.0s)]
*  It just turns your stomach. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=22.68s)]
*  That was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer yesterday not mincing words in his reaction [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=25.84s)]
*  to President Trump's comments suggesting diversity programs somehow caused Wednesday night's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=29.78s)]
*  deadly collision involving a passenger jet and military helicopter. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=34.06s)]
*  Joining us now, Washington correspondent for Spectrum News Kevin Frey. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=38.54s)]
*  Kevin, talk about how Democrats, we heard Schumer there, but are talking about Trump's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=42.06s)]
*  recent comments and the way that he's really stepping out of line with procedurally the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=47.86s)]
*  way that these kinds of investigations are done. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  Typically, all these updates come from the NTSB, obviously not. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=54.78s)]
*  Well, not even that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=58.22s)]
*  When you think of these tragedies, there's typically a very clear cut way that things [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=59.66s)]
*  proceed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=64.38s)]
*  The president usually comes out and provides a unifying message. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=65.38s)]
*  Think of Ronald Reagan after the Challenger explosion, Bill Clinton after Oklahoma City. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=67.78s)]
*  The list goes on trying to pump the brakes on any speculation and then allowing things [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=72.68s)]
*  to play out while at the same time trying to unify the country, essentially playing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=78.3s)]
*  the role of consular in chief. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=81.66s)]
*  That did not really happen beyond the first maybe three minutes of yesterday's press conference [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=83.8s)]
*  before we devolved over into conspiracies and conjecture about what may or may not have [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=87.30000000000001s)]
*  happened without any evidence to back it up. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=92.54s)]
*  So you've seen Democrats really latch on to this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=95.06s)]
*  They have, you know this certainly well, have faced some scrutiny from even within their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  ranks over the past week or so that they're floundering and there's a deluge of news and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=102.62s)]
*  there's so much happening. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  And what are we doing? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  This is one area where they clearly very easily were able to fall in line. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=108.14s)]
*  And you saw Senator Schumer there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=112.06s)]
*  You saw Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and rank and file below them going on the attack, basically [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=113.74s)]
*  saying how dare you try to make this about race, about women, about equity. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  This is a tragedy of colossal scale. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  So as Democrats are trying to figure out the way that they respond, one of the ways that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=127.1s)]
*  we've reported on and I know you're covering this as well is that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=131.22s)]
*  Schumer who also happen to be New Yorkers and thusly very in your wheelhouse are talking [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=135.62s)]
*  about not swinging at every ball basically, but when the ball is what we saw yesterday [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=140.14s)]
*  from the White House press briefing room, you absolutely have to swing at that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  Oh, I mean it was like right over home plate and I shouldn't be devolving into sports metaphors [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=148.61999999999998s)]
*  because it's everything from the OMB memo to asking federal workers to take buyouts [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  to then of course the president himself coming in the briefing room. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=159.98s)]
*  What I thought was the most illustrative thing that Jeffries has said over the last three [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=162.77999999999997s)]
*  months or so was in the weeks right after the election, he said to our colleague Paul [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=166.04s)]
*  Kane with the Washington Post, essentially, I'm not going to spend the next four years [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=171.44s)]
*  responding to every thing that this president does. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=177.28s)]
*  I'm not going to be reacting to every tweet and truth social post. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  And part of that is the Democrats have decided at least this go around. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=185.2s)]
*  We're focusing on a message. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=188.6s)]
*  What does the president do as opposed to what does the president say? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Now you have to respond when the president says things like yesterday, but they've really [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=192.88s)]
*  honed in on this economic message, believing that's the major takeaway from the 2024 election [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=197.0s)]
*  that they're here to support working families and so forth. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=202.44s)]
*  And so when it comes to the funding freeze from earlier this week, that plays right into [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=205.14s)]
*  that message that they can say that this president is more concerned about freezing up funds [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  so he can give, as Schumer described it the other day, Rob Peter to pay the billionaires. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=214.84s)]
*  And he's not concerned about you in the middle class. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=221.4s)]
*  So this is an area where they have now been able to really hone in on that message and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=223.24s)]
*  not to say take the bait, but essentially take the bait when Trump has thrown it up [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=229.8s)]
*  into the air. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  And I will say I was even sent an ad this morning from one of the main house super PACs [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  that's going to be going up on the air with an economic related message. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=238.76s)]
*  A lot of focus on things like price of eggs, cost of milk. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=242.6s)]
*  Those were central to the 2024 election. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=245.82s)]
*  I was wondering as I watched the press conference yesterday from the White House, if Republicans [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=248.68s)]
*  would, even privately, because we know that privately they sound differently than they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=253.56s)]
*  do publicly, but if they were unnerved by what we saw at the podium yesterday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=257.92s)]
*  We certainly really haven't seen much of it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=263.32s)]
*  Notably, I think maybe silence is the thing that speaks more so than otherwise. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=265.64s)]
*  You saw, I think, some of the typical Republicans you might expect, like Susan Collins, Lisa [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=269.88s)]
*  Murkowski coming out and kind of expressing some what exactly was he doing, discomfort's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=274.8s)]
*  going on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=280.08s)]
*  But we've not seen a lot of animated pushback. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=281.08s)]
*  And some of that is just illustrative of the fact that the Hill has transformed in the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  past eight years into much more of a party that's more or less willing to go along with [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=290.16s)]
*  And also on top of that, DEI was part of the conversation for a vast majority of the Republican [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=291.16s)]
*  Party during the 2024 cycle. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=295.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was a key point, actually. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=297.64s)]
*  I think what we're seeing so early on in this administration is almost as if the four [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=300.12s)]
*  years in between the two Trump terms didn't happen because the private conversations that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=305.56s)]
*  I've had with Republican lawmakers are exactly what they were. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=309.6s)]
*  The anxiety, the consternation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=312.88s)]
*  And we picked up right where we left off with the I didn't see that tweet. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=314.36s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=317.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=318.52s)]
*  When you ask about exactly Hill reporters coming ready with the receipts once again, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=319.52s)]
*  Kevin Frey bringing the receipts to us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=322.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNQ_tqnehA&t=324.76s)]
