# Trump demands Harris be ‘investigated,’ calls for Biden to reclaim 'rightful place’ on ticket
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4)
*  Back to politics now and former president Trump wants president Biden to return to the race [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=0.0s)]
*  and become the Democratic nominee. And at Truth Social Post yesterday Trump wrote in part this, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=5.76s)]
*  Kamala should be investigated and forced off the campaign and Joe Biden allowed to take back his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=11.6s)]
*  rightful place. Parentheses he got 14 million primary votes, she got none. This latest screed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=17.36s)]
*  all stems from the vice president's recent interview with 60 Minutes and Trump's false claims [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  the program was edited to Paris's benefit. Before the interview even aired Trump backed out of his [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=29.2s)]
*  own scheduled appearance with 60 Minutes providing a winding list of reasons why he has posted about [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=36.48s)]
*  this repeatedly in recent days. To Arizona now multiple Republican lawyers who were involved [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=42.16s)]
*  in the party's election litigation efforts in the past are keeping their distance this time around. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=48.08s)]
*  This comes amid growing concerns over Republican Senate candidate Carrie Lake's history [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=53.68s)]
*  of questionable fraud claims. Joining us now to break this all down our resident Arizona expert, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Vaughn Hilliard. Vaughn so good to see you this morning. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=65.2s)]
*  So let's let's start there in Arizona these lawyers staying away from this election integrity [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=70.08s)]
*  effort give us the backstory and tell us why they're choosing to keep their distance. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=75.44s)]
*  Right I've been in Arizona for about the last week just got back here to New York and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  one of the things that I was finding was that Carrie Lake is very much the Carrie Lake of 2022. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=82.96s)]
*  She nearly lost her governor but she is already laying the foundation claiming that there are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=87.84s)]
*  efforts underway using overseas ballots for examples to cheat and keep her from winning [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  the U.S. Senate keep Donald Trump from winning the state of Arizona but part of that that I found was [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=97.92s)]
*  that there's right now no Arizona Republican lawyers that are there ready to defend or bring [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=103.2s)]
*  any of these cases on her behalf here. I talked to three of them who were involved previously in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=109.76s)]
*  election cycles in 2020-2022 and of course the RNC has built up this election integrity operation [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=115.6s)]
*  so that they could keep the fraud from happening on the front end instead of [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  litigating it on the back end so they say but right now those Republican lawyers told me that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  they have stayed away because of Carrie Lake's penchant to raise fraud claims yet of course [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=130.32s)]
*  lawyers can't just bring frivolous lawsuits. One of her own lawyers is facing not only financial [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=136.0s)]
*  penalty but it's currently suspended because of lawsuits in which she claimed to the Arizona [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=142.48s)]
*  Supreme Court that tens of thousands of ballots were fraudulent in the 2022 gubernatorial election [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=147.2s)]
*  so right now they brought in a high-powered California attorney RNC committee woman Harmeet [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=152.48s)]
*  Dhillon but they're currently looking for local counsel because it's local counsel that actually [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=157.12s)]
*  has someone bring the lawsuits so really right now it's lawyers saying we don't have the fraud that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  Carrie Lake is already claiming. So give us an update with that as the backdrop give us an update [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  as to where things stand in this race between Lake and Democrat Ruben Gallego. Right she's facing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=169.44s)]
*  the congressman from the heart of Phoenix really the bluest district you'll find in Arizona and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  right now polling has shown her significantly down to Ruben Gallego anywhere from five to ten [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  percentage points and of course Democrats have won the last three U.S. Senate races there and for [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=185.44s)]
*  you know Ruben Gallego he was a longtime progressive member of the progressive caucus up on Capitol Hill [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=191.12s)]
*  he has really sort of you know expanded his political you know representation and saying [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=196.32s)]
*  that he's there to appeal to Republicans and independents and the part for Carrie Lake is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=203.44s)]
*  she's currently underwater to Donald Trump and we're seeing this in many of the battleground [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  states not just Arizona where these Senate candidates Republicans want to take back the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  Senate but their candidates are actually behind where Donald Trump is in the question in these [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=215.28s)]
*  final two weeks at what point does Donald Trump throw those Senate candidates off the cliff because [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=219.2s)]
*  he sees his own polling so close in those states and those Republicans are not viewed in quite the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=223.36s)]
*  same fond light that even he is in some of these key states. We also raised some questions about [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  maybe that the polling is as accurate as it needs to be and certainly Arizona would appears to be [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=232.4s)]
*  Trump's best battleground state at the moment but still within the margin of error. We got to leave [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=236.4s)]
*  it there but Vaughn we're going to talk to you again a little later on Morning Joe NBC News [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  correspondent Vaughn Hilliard. Thank you. We will revisit Vaughn a little later. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=243.44000000000003s)]
*  you [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7733IVQzv4&t=253.36s)]
