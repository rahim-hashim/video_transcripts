# Sen. Susan Collins announces support for Tulsi Gabbard
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw)
*  The Senate Finance Committee will vote today on whether to advance the nomination of Robert F. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=0.0s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services Secretary, the fate of Kennedy's bid could [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=4.32s)]
*  fall upon Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Senator Cassidy, a medical doctor, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=8.8s)]
*  is a member of the Finance Committee and chairman of the HELP Committee, the other panel that held [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=14.0s)]
*  a hearing for R.F.K. Jr. last week. And Cassidy has openly struggled with Kennedy's nomination, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=18.8s)]
*  specifically when it comes to his past conspiracy theories about vaccines. Meanwhile, another of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=24.16s)]
*  Trump's cabinet picks just picked up a key endorsement ahead of her committee vote later [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=29.52s)]
*  today. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has announced she will vote in favor of Tulsi [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Gabbard for director of national intelligence. She explained her decision to reporters yesterday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=38.64s)]
*  After extensive consideration, conversations with her in my office, attending the hearing, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=45.04s)]
*  questioning her there, and listening to her in the closed session, I decided to vote that I will [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=54.0s)]
*  vote for her. I believe she's committed to strengthening our national security. And [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=62.56s)]
*  I questioned her extensively about her views on Edward Snowden, and I am now satisfied that she [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=72.4s)]
*  will not seek in any way to have him pardoned, which was a question that I answered in open session. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=82.32s)]
*  Also yesterday, the Senate voted to confirm Chris Wright, a secretary of energy. Eight Democrats [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  voted in favor. The Senate also narrowly voted to advance Pam Bondi's nomination to be attorney [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  general to a full chamber vote. Joining us now, former communications director for Republican [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=102.16s)]
*  Senator Cory Gardner, Annalise Keller. We also have Jonathan Cot. He's a former senior advisor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  to Democratic Senator Chris Coons. Guys, thanks for joining. Annalise, I'll start with you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=111.84s)]
*  What do you make of the difficulty that Cassidy clearly is struggling with here publicly in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=116.0s)]
*  regards to RFK's nomination? Does he ultimately come around? You know, I think he is ultimately [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=122.48s)]
*  going to come around, Ali, but I think he has a lot on the line here. He is up for reelection, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  which I think should not be lost in this conversation. He has, of course, voted to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  impeach President Donald Trump, and that is part of the reason that he's facing a tough primary [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=136.96s)]
*  challenger. He's facing a former congressperson who's running against him. So I think all of that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  weighs heavy on his mind. But, you know, when you're watching the committee hearings, something to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=147.12s)]
*  think about too is these are not the only, this five minute exchange is not the only conversation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=151.52s)]
*  that they're having with these nominees. There is so much written materials. There are meetings, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=157.12s)]
*  phone calls, their teams are communicating. So I think, you know, it also just comes down to whether [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=163.28s)]
*  or not he feels comfortable that RFK Jr. has answered a lot of the vaccine issues that he's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=167.84s)]
*  concerned about. The public questions, I imagine, match a lot of the private ones. But for someone [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=172.32s)]
*  like Susan Collins, who's relying in that statement on the private conversations that she had to help [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=178.0s)]
*  her get to yes with Tulsi Gabbard, we know that not being able to call Edward Snowden a traitor was [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=183.52s)]
*  one of the key things that stuck in the crawl of a lot of Republican senators. What could Tulsi [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=188.72s)]
*  Gabbard have said that assuaged this, even from someone like Collins, who helped write the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=193.44s)]
*  legislation to create the post that Gabbard is now likely to be confirmed to? I have no idea what [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=197.2s)]
*  could have been said in that setting, given how poorly she performed in the open setting and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=202.32s)]
*  couldn't answer the softball questions that Republicans were lobbing up for her. And you're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=207.36s)]
*  right. Most of these five minute segments are for show. They're to get clicks online. They're to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=212.16s)]
*  raise money to your followers. You have these private hour-long, two-hour, three-hour-long [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=218.32s)]
*  conversations with these members. And a lot of the Trump nominees have completely flipped their [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  positions on previous statements they've made. Cash Patel, all of a sudden, has no recollection [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=228.48s)]
*  of any of these podcasts that he regularly appeared on. Tulsi Gabbard didn't seem to back [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=233.68s)]
*  down from any of her previous really troubling statements. So I don't know what she told Senator [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=239.76s)]
*  Collins privately, but it was enough to get her the vote. And that one vote probably means she [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=245.28s)]
*  is going to be in charge of our national intelligence, which is really troubling. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  And there are certainly those private conversations that sound so different than the public ones, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=255.36s)]
*  especially when some of these folks get to yes. Can you talk about the dissonance that you've [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=260.24s)]
*  heard? You worked on the Hill for a long time in Republican circles. I mean, there is a difference. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=264.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. I mean, there is additional information that they're requesting. I mean, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  they're going through trying to figure, trying to really get evidence of what they're claiming in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=276.0s)]
*  some of these conversations that are more public. They're trying to say, can you back some of these [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=283.68s)]
*  things up? And a lot of it, while I would like to say a lot of it comes down to them being able to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=288.4s)]
*  back up some of these changes, I think a lot of it is politics. And it's what's going to happen to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=295.2s)]
*  you in your reelection. We've seen some of these other members that are struggling with that. Not [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=301.68s)]
*  only Cassidy. I mean, we saw what happened with Tillis, with Hegseth. I think all of those things, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=307.52s)]
*  this is not happening in a vacuum. And there are other pressures that these senators are having to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=312.0s)]
*  weigh. Yeah. I think you're right to bring up the politics piece here, because the 2026 senators [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=316.4s)]
*  also happen to be a lot of the names that we talk about during the course of will they or won't they [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=321.36s)]
*  get to yes in this process. For example, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa during the initial Hegseth phase, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  she's up in 2026. There were threats of a primary Tom Tillis in North Carolina. You've also got Susan [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=330.24s)]
*  Collins in Maine and others. Cassidy in Louisiana. How much is the politics palpable here, Pat? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  The politics is almost the number one issue for a lot of them. And it's unfortunate that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  we've gotten to a point where being primaried is probably the toughest part of winning a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=346.64s)]
*  reelection fight for a lot of these members, especially in MAGA, especially in MAGA. And [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=352.24s)]
*  a call from Mike Davis, Steve Bannon or Elon Musk is the most terrifying thing any of these senators [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=356.8s)]
*  can get knowing that means a primary challenge is coming and they don't want to face that. So I think [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=363.52s)]
*  it is looming over them. No matter what they say, they have to look two years ahead and say, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=369.36s)]
*  do I want to spend the next two years trying to raise a hundred million dollars and fend off a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=374.4s)]
*  primary challenge and then have to go head to head in a purple state against a well-funded, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=379.2s)]
*  moderate candidate after I've gone so far to the right? That's not easy. Is there a limit to those [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  threats, though? Can you only threaten someone with a primary for so long or does everyone actually [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=390.08s)]
*  just say the threat is too great? I'm just going to say yes to everything. Yeah, I think there's a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=395.52s)]
*  limit. Sure. I mean, something else to think of. When it stops working. I guess that's right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=399.36s)]
*  Or, you know, some of these members have said that they're thinking about retiring, too. I mean, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  there you have McConnell, for example, who I think has been fascinating to watch through all of this. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=410.88s)]
*  You know, he is someone who I don't necessarily see his votes as voting against Republicans or, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=416.32s)]
*  you know, he's obviously been a party loyalist. I see him as more just I'm out here voting my [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  conscience. No one is really behind the scenes. He's kind of going rogue, just doing, you know, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=427.92s)]
*  voting, you know, however he thinks he should. Which McConnell has become sort of McConnell's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  worst nightmare as someone who so steadfastly kept Republican senators in line all those years. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  He is a fascinating profile and he's laid out that national security is sort of the umbrella [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=443.12s)]
*  under which he's operating and parsing through his votes. So I think it's going to be a fascinating [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=448.8s)]
*  profile for someone like McConnell, but a really interesting conversation. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=454.24s)]
*  Us Democrats are really going to enjoy the next two years of Mitch McConnell. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=456.88s)]
*  We've been waiting for this and it's going to be fun. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=460.48s)]
*  Words I never thought I'd hear. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=462.8s)]
*  Words I never thought I'd say, but I'm grabbing the popcorn and I'm enjoying it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=464.64s)]
*  All right, Kot, save popcorn for me, Annalise Keller, and Jonathan Kot. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you both for joining us this morning. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=471.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhsdZyz_uw&t=484.24s)]
