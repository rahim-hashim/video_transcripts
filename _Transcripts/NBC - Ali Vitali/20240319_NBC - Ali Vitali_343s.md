# Congress reaches tentative deal on government funding
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressional leaders have reached a deal on funding the government for the rest of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=3.4s)]
*  the fiscal year. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=6.8s)]
*  Two sources familiar with the talks say negotiators have an agreement in principle for the homeland [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=8.38s)]
*  security portion of the package. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=13.18s)]
*  That had been a real sticking point. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=14.92s)]
*  The rest of the legislation had been agreed to at the end of last week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=16.54s)]
*  The DHS funding had been contentious for both sides as the clock ticked towards Friday's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  deadline. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Before ending to two sources, Democrats were pushing for additional border security funding, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=25.639999999999997s)]
*  while Republicans wanted more cash to go towards the agency's core mission, without elaborating [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  as to what that is. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=36.0s)]
*  Joining us now, congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael Schnell. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=37.8s)]
*  Michael, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=41.72s)]
*  So first of all, just tell us a little bit more about the deal, but also what hurdles [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=44.56s)]
*  still remain between now and the deadline on Friday? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=48.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=51.44s)]
*  Hey, Jonathan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=52.44s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=53.44s)]
*  What we know right now about this agreement is that there is a deal on the table, that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  deal in principle, as you mentioned, between congressional leaders to fund the Department [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=58.0s)]
*  of Homeland Security through the end of the fiscal year. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=62.08s)]
*  And this was sort of the final puzzle piece to the package of bills that's needed to avert [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=64.88s)]
*  a partial government shutdown on Friday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=69.24s)]
*  The deals are still being, the details are still being worked out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=71.6s)]
*  Crucially, the legislative text is still being written. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=75.12s)]
*  So there's going to be some time until we see the particulars here, but there's still [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=77.96s)]
*  a host of hurdles in terms of averting that shutdown. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=81.26s)]
*  The deadline, of course, is Friday at midnight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=84.5s)]
*  Conservatives have been very adamant in the House that they need at least 72 hours to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=87.7s)]
*  review any legislation that comes to the floor for a vote, particularly appropriations bills, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  especially as conservatives oppose these government funding bills we have heard, very vocal opposition. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  With that 72 hours, if you factor that in, if text is released by Friday, by Wednesday, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=104.62s)]
*  we could be looking at a Friday or Saturday vote just in the House. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=110.34s)]
*  And then the Senate is its own, you know, bag, can of worms where you need 100 senators [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=113.82s)]
*  to sign on, unanimous consent to speed up the process. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=118.16s)]
*  Jonathan, as we know, you really don't get 100 percent agreement on anything in the Senate [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=121.02s)]
*  these days, let alone a government funding bill. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=125.14s)]
*  It's going to be tough. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=127.34s)]
*  Yeah, certainly good progress, but not done yet. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=128.34s)]
*  Michael, let's look forward, though, a little bit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=131.38s)]
*  If indeed this does get done, the government stays open. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  The House has suggested that they'll move towards maybe some Ukraine funding next. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=138.57999999999998s)]
*  And you've got some new reporting on that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  What do you have? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=143.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=144.1s)]
*  Speaker Johnson on a number of occasions has suggested, indicated that once government [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=145.1s)]
*  funding is wrapped up, and remember, we are five and a half months into fiscal year 2024, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=149.42s)]
*  so it should be wrapped up soon, conventionally speaking, the House would move to tackle Ukraine [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=154.06s)]
*  aid, which is, of course, bedeviled lawmakers in the House for months. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=159.14s)]
*  It's been a very politically prickly topic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=162.94s)]
*  Jonathan says he's going to attack it head on. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=165.73999999999998s)]
*  But that raises a whole host of questions of how exactly the House will go ahead with [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  sending additional aid to Ukraine. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=173.1s)]
*  Of course, Speaker Johnson has thrown cold water on a number of occasions at that Senate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=174.82s)]
*  foreign aid bill, which included aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and Taiwan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  We've seen them, the House conservatives, throw cold water on that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=186.73999999999998s)]
*  So Johnson told Senate Republicans last week that he plans to move ahead with the Ukraine [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=190.22s)]
*  aid bill, but it's going to look very different from the Senate bill. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=194.72000000000003s)]
*  He also then told Politico in a subsequent interview that this bill will be standalone, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=197.52s)]
*  which means it won't hitch a ride on government funding or another must pass bill. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=202.36s)]
*  And crucially, Jonathan, he said he expects it to be moved under suspension of the rules, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  which is a fast track process that requires two thirds support for passage, which essentially [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=210.28s)]
*  means you're going to need buy in from Democrats. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  And of course, we've heard Johnson on a number of occasions say Ukraine must be paired with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=216.36s)]
*  border security. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  That begs the question of how does he expect to form a package that includes the Ukraine [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=222.18s)]
*  aid and border security and still get Democrats on board? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=226.18s)]
*  It seems that the more he talks about his expectations for this package, Jonathan, the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=229.36s)]
*  more questions it raises. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=233.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's certainly the White House pushing for this Ukraine funding for quite some time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=234.34s)]
*  And Michael, lastly, you mentioned border security. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=237.86s)]
*  Democrats are really going on the offensive right now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  It's part of this deal that's hoped that should be worked out this week, but also they're [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  trying to make it part of the upcoming campaign. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=247.22s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about that push. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen in poll after poll, Jonathan, recently in recent months when talking about [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=251.34s)]
*  the 2024 election, that voters are most concerned and interested about the border and immigration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  It's surpassed the economy in a number of polls. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=261.06s)]
*  It's surpassed abortion and women's reproductive rights in a number of these surveys. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=263.54s)]
*  So we've seen both parties try to go on the offensive when they discuss the topics of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=267.38s)]
*  border security and immigration reform. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=271.22s)]
*  Of course, for months we've seen Republicans do this really hammering at the Biden administration [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=273.1s)]
*  for the situation at the southern border. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=278.3s)]
*  But we've also seen Democrats try to use this topic to their advantage, particularly [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=279.98s)]
*  in New York 3 last month, where we saw Congressman Tom Swasey notch a win, flip that district [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  from red to blue, largely because he went on the offensive about immigration reform, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=290.38s)]
*  saying that the Senate bill should have been passed, saying that Democrats should attack [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  this issue head on. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=298.86s)]
*  So as we see voters become increasingly concerned about immigration, about the border, expect [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=300.18s)]
*  both parties to try to make gains on that and really capitalize it on the campaign trail. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=305.9s)]
*  Yeah, the Biden re-election team believes the same. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=311.78s)]
*  I think we'll hear from the president about this very topic when he heads to Arizona this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=313.78s)]
*  week. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=317.74s)]
*  Congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael Schnell, thank you as always. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=318.74s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WBM06SqdM&t=321.78s)]
