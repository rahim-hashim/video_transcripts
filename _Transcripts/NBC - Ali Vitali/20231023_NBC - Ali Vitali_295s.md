# Nine Republicans join House speaker race
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog)
*  We turn now to the nation's capital where the House Republicans battle for a new speaker [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=0.0s)]
*  is dragging into a third week and has taken yet another twist and turn. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=5.44s)]
*  This morning there are nine, nine candidates vying for the position. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=11.32s)]
*  All of them declared their bids after Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio dropped his bid late last [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=16.4s)]
*  week following three failed House floor votes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=22.56s)]
*  That wasn't really his choice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=25.08s)]
*  The Republican conference voted behind closed doors to dump him. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  Jordan out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  Here's what happens next. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=32.76s)]
*  A GOP candidate form is set for this evening. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  Then an internal conference vote is scheduled for tomorrow morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  Following that, interim speaker Patrick McHenry has said his intention is to move to a floor [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=42.12s)]
*  vote as soon as Tuesday, so maybe in the afternoon tomorrow. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=46.84s)]
*  The fiasco has left many Republicans frustrated, including Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=51.56s)]
*  who is calling the dysfunctional drama embarrassing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  I want a speaker in the chair so we can move forward and get over my issues, my committee [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=62.96s)]
*  of war and peace. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=67.56s)]
*  It's too dangerous right now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=69.22s)]
*  The world's on fire and this is so dangerous what we're doing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  And most importantly, it's embarrassing because it empowers and emboldens our adversaries [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=74.84s)]
*  like Chairman Xi, who says democracy doesn't work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=80.52s)]
*  Joining us now, congressional correspondent for the New York Times, Luke Broadwater. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Luke, good to see you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=89.88s)]
*  He's not wrong. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=91.52s)]
*  Embarrassing, dysfunctional, chaotic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=92.44s)]
*  Pick your word. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=94.16s)]
*  We're now a third week without a speaker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=95.44s)]
*  So talk to us about some of these candidates who have put their names forth. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=97.12s)]
*  Is there a favorite in the mix? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so nine candidates have submitted their names to run for speaker. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  If you had, you know, probably the front runner is Tom Emmer, the Republican whip from Minnesota. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=111.48s)]
*  He is in leadership. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=120.28s)]
*  He has the endorsement of former speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=121.84s)]
*  He is the former campaign chair for House Republicans. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=126.4s)]
*  And a lot of people credit him for the fact that Republicans took the House in the last [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=130.08s)]
*  election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=135.8s)]
*  And so he he has inroads both with the conservatives and the more mainstream candidates of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  party. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=143.36s)]
*  But he does have one big problem. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=144.36s)]
*  And that is that Donald Trump doesn't seem to support him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  And Donald Trump's allies are against him already. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=149.84s)]
*  Steve Bannon, who is a close ally of Donald Trump, has been campaigning against Tom Emmer [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  on the radio. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=159.0s)]
*  And remember, you only need four House Republicans to object to your candidacy and you can't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=160.48s)]
*  become speaker. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=166.04s)]
*  The margins are so close. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=167.04s)]
*  So it looks like a very tough task for Tom Emmer to get the votes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=168.76s)]
*  But I would say right now he's probably the front runner. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=174.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=176.48s)]
*  So let's walk through the next couple of days. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=177.48s)]
*  As you rightly point out, it's a tough task for anyone. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=181.48s)]
*  Emmer has some opposition. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  Even if he falls short, someone else steps up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=187.2s)]
*  Do we really think this is going to happen? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=189.44s)]
*  Like by tomorrow night, are we going to have a speaker or is this going to spill on for [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=191.04s)]
*  days or another week? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=194.28s)]
*  I'm very pessimistic about the Republicans chances to get a speaker. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=197.8s)]
*  We've seen the after throwing out Kevin McCarthy, who had 96 percent support of the conference, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=203.64s)]
*  Steve Scalise, the number two Republican, couldn't get it done. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=209.92s)]
*  Then Jim Jordan, a favorite of the hard right, who's the judiciary chairman, couldn't get [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=213.24s)]
*  it done. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=217.84s)]
*  So there's a couple other candidates. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=219.28s)]
*  There are other candidates in this race. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=221.12s)]
*  But I'm very pessimistic about the effect, about the chances for House Republicans to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=223.24s)]
*  come to 217, which is the amount of votes they need. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=228.52s)]
*  And that's just extraordinary considering not just the lack of speaker prevents the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=231.32s)]
*  U.S. from fully helping Israel or Ukraine, but also the government's poised to shut down [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=235.68s)]
*  again in just a couple of weeks. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=239.6s)]
*  Real quick, last one. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=241.52s)]
*  If this does indeed, if you're right and they don't get a speaker these next couple of days, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=242.52s)]
*  for a coalition style speaker with the Democrats helping out? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=246.44s)]
*  I think with each passing day, it becomes more likely that you could put in the temporary [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=252.04s)]
*  speaker Patrick McHenry. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=256.28s)]
*  But again, the conservative wing of the party is very much against that idea. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=258.48s)]
*  But as the pressure continues and we get nearer to a shutdown, that does seem more and more [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=262.48s)]
*  likely. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=267.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=268.44s)]
*  Really good stuff this morning from congressional correspondent for the New York Times, Luke [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=269.44s)]
*  Brawbauter. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=272.2s)]
*  Luke, always good to see you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=273.2s)]
*  We'll talk to you again down the road. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGhm44GLPog&t=274.2s)]
