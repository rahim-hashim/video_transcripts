# Trump's allies help him get around gag order
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI)
*  I'm here for the simple reason to show support for a friend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=0.0s)]
*  Luckily, the president's supporters should know that he's actually in great spirits despite [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=3.84s)]
*  the circumstances of this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=8.16s)]
*  I'm here today to represent and to pay my respects to what President Trump is going [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=9.56s)]
*  through. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=14.6s)]
*  It's a tough time for him. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  That courtroom is depressing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=17.68s)]
*  This is New York City, the icon of our country, and we've got a courtroom that's the most [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=19.96s)]
*  depressing thing I've ever been in. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=26.0s)]
*  Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on Republican candidate for the president of the United [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=28.4s)]
*  States this year. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=34.72s)]
*  That's all this is. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=35.72s)]
*  Republican candidate for president of the United States is going through mental anguish [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=36.72s)]
*  in a courtroom that's very depressing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=42.04s)]
*  Very depressing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=44.9s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=45.9s)]
*  Some of Donald Trump's allies joined him in New York yesterday for his criminal hush money [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  trial. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=51.32s)]
*  Outside of court, they said what Trump can't because of the gag order in place on the former [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=52.32s)]
*  president. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=57.72s)]
*  You just saw both Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio and Senator Tommy Tomberlowe of Alabama said [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=58.92s)]
*  they're just there to support a friend, but both then criticized Trump's former fixer, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=64.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=69.0s)]
*  Vance also attacked the judge's daughter, repeating unfounded claims made by the former [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=70.0s)]
*  president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=75.28s)]
*  Joining us now to talk about this spectacle, senior columnist for the Daily Beast, Matt [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=76.28s)]
*  Lewis. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Matt, good morning to you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=84.28s)]
*  It was noted early in the first days of the trial that Trump didn't really have any supporters [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  there at all, not even the members of his family. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  That's changed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=91.76s)]
*  Eric Trump has been there a few times now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=92.76s)]
*  And now some bold-faced political names have also started to show up in recent days. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=94.4s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=100.0s)]
*  Why are they there? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=103.0s)]
*  Are they just trying to further curry favor with the man who, I guess, could be president [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=104.0s)]
*  again? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=108.4s)]
*  Well, look, I think it's making the best out of a pretty bad situation. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=109.4s)]
*  And as you noted, Donald Trump was able to launder his attacks on the judge, the witnesses, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=113.92s)]
*  so that he doesn't directly violate the gag order. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=121.64s)]
*  That's one reason for them to be there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=124.56s)]
*  I also think it does show action, activity, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=127.4s)]
*  You've got Joe Biden, who is right now not doing great in the polls. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=131.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump, people are coming to New York to kind of curry favor with him [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=136.88s)]
*  and to pay homage to him and kiss the ring. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=142.48s)]
*  Some of these people are hoping to be ambassadors or maybe even a running mate for vice president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=145.48s)]
*  So he's stuck in New York. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=151.3s)]
*  It's probably a smart move for him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=153.6s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit more about the trial. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=155.68s)]
*  You've got a new piece in the Daily Beast with the headline, Michael Cohen is no hero. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=157.28s)]
*  Cohen, of course, the former fixer who testified yesterday, back to the stand in just a few [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=161.96s)]
*  hours' time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=166.52s)]
*  Tell us about what you wrote. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=168.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=169.84s)]
*  Look, obviously, Michael Cohen is the star witness in this trial. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=170.88s)]
*  I think there's even a potential that this may be the only trial we get before the election [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=174.32s)]
*  and maybe it will be the one that takes Donald Trump down. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  And if you don't like Donald Trump, that's all good news. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=182.28s)]
*  I just want to caution my friends in the media and the Never Trump movement and the quote [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=185.0s)]
*  unquote resistance, however they define themselves, that Michael Cohen is not a good guy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=189.6s)]
*  This is someone who worked for over a decade for Donald Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=195.22s)]
*  According to testimony he gave to Congress, he attacked something like 500 people on behalf [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=199.34s)]
*  of Donald Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=206.46s)]
*  Now it seems that Michael Cohen is on some sort of a rehabilitation tour. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=207.86s)]
*  He's got a podcast. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=212.62s)]
*  He's got books. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=213.94s)]
*  He's pitching a reality show. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=215.74s)]
*  And I think this is his maybe opportunity to parlay that into something, his 15 minutes [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=218.48s)]
*  into something even bigger. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=223.7s)]
*  So look, if he can be helpful to this cause, by all means, cheer him on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=225.06s)]
*  If you're rooting for Donald Trump to be finally taken down, I don't think we should make Michael [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=231.1s)]
*  Cohen into a hero. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=236.94s)]
*  And that would be the one outcome of this that I think would be negative. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=239.26s)]
*  He's not a hero. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=243.58s)]
*  He's a bad guy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=244.78s)]
*  And I think he'd still be working for Donald Trump as his fixer if things had gone differently. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=245.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=250.62s)]
*  He has more or less said as much. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=251.62s)]
*  And certainly he has real credibility issues, which we know the defense will try to take [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=253.18s)]
*  advantage of in the days ahead. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  Matt, let's talk about the state of the race. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=258.38s)]
*  You mentioned the polls. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  There was a series of New York Times, Santa College battleground state polls yesterday [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  that were pretty favorable for Trump, although certainly those in the blue wall states, very [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  close race, margin of error, and depending on other surveys, Biden up in a few. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=271.16s)]
*  But we are seeing a trend here that, you know, whether the margins are a little fluid, but [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=275.5s)]
*  down in the sun belt, Georgia, Arizona and even Nevada, Trump showing real strength, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=280.0s)]
*  Biden weakness. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=285.32s)]
*  Give us your overall sense of the picture here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=286.32s)]
*  I think it's gloomy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=288.84s)]
*  The sun belt is gloomy if you were Joe Biden. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=290.68s)]
*  And Jonathan, I think what's really concerning here is that if you look at some of the Senate [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=294.36s)]
*  races, the Democrats running for the U.S. Senate are running ahead of Joe Biden. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=298.76s)]
*  So that suggests to me like this isn't like a polling error. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=305.32s)]
*  This isn't a, you know, some sort of a structural problem with the sampling. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=309.1s)]
*  This is a Joe Biden problem. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=314.7s)]
*  And it's too late now to change horses in the middle of the stream or whatever that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=317.1s)]
*  old cliche is. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=321.94s)]
*  Democrats, it's going to be Joe Biden. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=323.38s)]
*  I don't know how they turn it around. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=326.7s)]
*  This is a Joe Biden problem. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=329.2s)]
*  I guess acceptance is the first step. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=330.7s)]
*  Democrats, be aware. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=333.06s)]
*  This is not, it's not a poll problem. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=334.58s)]
*  It's not a Democrat problem. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=337.38s)]
*  It's a Joe Biden problem. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=338.82s)]
*  So let's link these two topics together. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=340.38s)]
*  As you said, maybe this is the only trial that happens right now in the election. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=342.58s)]
*  Let's say Trump is convicted. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  And maybe this trial is not as serious, quote unquote, as some of the other legal problems [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=349.38s)]
*  he faces, but it's still a conviction. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=353.52s)]
*  Do you think that's going to matter at all? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=355.05999999999995s)]
*  I do think it would matter. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=357.17999999999995s)]
*  Look, I think if you're Joe Biden and if you're Democrats, you shouldn't bank on that outcome. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=358.61999999999995s)]
*  We have no idea actually. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=363.97999999999996s)]
*  I was going to take it would be one juror for a hung jury. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=365.38s)]
*  But I do think it would matter. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=370.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, I say, pray as if it all depends on God, work as if it all depends on you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=372.46000000000004s)]
*  Biden, this should not factor into the calculus or the strategy of Democrats. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=377.38s)]
*  But if it happens, if there is a conviction, then that's good news for you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=381.66s)]
*  Yeah, Democrats not banking on it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  But even if it just moves the race at a margins and a race this close, a point or two, that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=388.62s)]
*  might make the difference. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=392.58000000000004s)]
*  See your columnist for The Daily Beast, Matt Lewis. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=393.78s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  We'll talk to you again soon. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppFhggF08WI&t=397.09999999999997s)]
