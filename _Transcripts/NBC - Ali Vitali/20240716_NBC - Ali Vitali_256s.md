# Trump makes first appearance since assassination attempt
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c)
*  Let's begin with Vance. We just played a lot of that public criticism. So take us behind the scenes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=0.0s)]
*  How did Trump make the choice to go with Vance? What does that say? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=6.32s)]
*  And how did he get by all the nasty things Vance once said about him? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=10.96s)]
*  Well, we know that he was, Donald Trump had narrowed down his field basically to J.D. Vance, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=16.8s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio from Florida and Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=23.28s)]
*  He told his sons last week that he was leaning toward his elder sons, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=27.2s)]
*  Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., that he was leaning toward Doug Burgum. And that is when, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=32.08s)]
*  according to our sources, they threw a little bit of a fit and told him that he shouldn't pick [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=38.08s)]
*  Burgum. And as one source described it, basically said to him, J.D., J.D., J.D. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=42.24s)]
*  Over the course of the last several days, Trump informed Doug Burgum and Marco Rubio that it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=49.44s)]
*  wasn't going to be them actually informing them yesterday. And Rubio had gone to see Trump on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=56.4s)]
*  Friday. In fact, Trump had conversations with all three of them last week. And in the case of Rubio, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=63.68s)]
*  Rubio himself brought up objections to being vice presidential candidate because he was worried [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=70.96s)]
*  that it might cause legal problems for Trump in terms of the Constitution saying that electors [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=78.32s)]
*  can't vote for a president or vice president from the same state. It's complicated stuff. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=86.08s)]
*  But basically, Rubio went to Trump and said, hey, I know what the problem is. I don't want [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=89.12s)]
*  to be blamed or held responsible for this. I think he knew he wasn't going to get it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=92.0s)]
*  Bottom line here is, as Kellyanne Conway put it to us, Donald Trump got back to where he started [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=95.6s)]
*  in terms of picking Vance. Now, as far as getting past some of those things that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=101.52s)]
*  J.D. Vance has said way back when, Trump likes nothing more than the zeal of a convert. I don't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=106.48s)]
*  think that's unusual. It would have been impossible for him to find someone, including [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=112.4s)]
*  Rubio and Borgam, who hadn't said bad things about him in the past. In the case of Vance, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=116.64s)]
*  some of them are pretty bad, comparing him to Hitler, obviously, very, very much in that vein. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=120.48s)]
*  But in 2016, J.D. Vance was trying to sell a book. In 2024, he's trying to sell [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=126.56s)]
*  himself as a populist vice presidential candidate. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=131.6s)]
*  Yeah. We'll certainly have more on this pick later in the show. But it's a pure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=133.84s)]
*  MAGA selection, one that some Democrats think may open the door a little bit and help their [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=137.6s)]
*  ticket. So, John, we also, of course, we've been playing some video here, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=142.96s)]
*  Donald Trump making this appearance last night at the RNC, his first public appearance since the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=147.12s)]
*  shooting at the rally, bandage on his ear. Tell us a little bit more about the crowd reaction and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=152.64s)]
*  just the overall feeling to this point after day one of the RNC. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=157.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you would always expect any candidate coming into a convention full of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=161.68s)]
*  the delegates that are pledged to nominate them for the presidency and others who came to witness [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=168.32s)]
*  it, who aren't delegates, to get a rousing ovation, to get a standing ovation, to have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=174.16s)]
*  energy and excitement. And then, of course, you pile on top of it the concern that the folks here [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=179.36s)]
*  had for and many Americans who are not here had for Donald Trump, you know, with the near, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=184.24s)]
*  I guess called a near miss, the close call of the assassination attempt on Saturday and, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=192.0s)]
*  you know, him coming into the arena and pumping his fist, you know, recreating the moment [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=197.44s)]
*  right after a bullet pierced his ear. You know, it was electric inside the arena. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=204.88s)]
*  These are people who very much love Donald Trump. We're happy to see him [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=212.16s)]
*  safe with the reminder of the bandage on the ear in terms of the first day of the Republican [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=216.0s)]
*  convention. Otherwise, pretty much like you expect conventions to go. People are excited to be here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=221.04s)]
*  All right, NBC's Jonathan Allen, live for us from Milwaukee. Thank you so much. I'm sure we'll talk [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRri6762_c&t=227.12s)]
