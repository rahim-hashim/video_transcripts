# Republicans react to major election losses
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8)
*  As we turn back to politics, Republicans are reacting to their continuing trend of election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=0.0s)]
*  losses. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=5.48s)]
*  That continued on Tuesday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=6.48s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump blamed the loss of David Cameron, whom he endorsed for governor [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=7.48s)]
*  of Kentucky, on Senator Mitch McConnell. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  In the Truth Social Post, Trump wrote in part this, Daniel Cameron lost because he couldn't [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=15.44s)]
*  alleviate the stench of Mitch McConnell, adding, I moved him up 25 points, but the McConnell [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=20.3s)]
*  relationship was too much to bear. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=25.28s)]
*  Republican presidential candidate, Governor Ron DeSantis, acknowledged GOP's poor performance [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=27.96s)]
*  across the board while highlighting his state's big GOP wins back in 2022. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=31.44s)]
*  Three GOP sources told NBC News that candidates are now being encouraged to make clear to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=37.4s)]
*  voters that they do not favor a national ban on all abortions in order to win competitive [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=42.44s)]
*  races next year. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  But just yesterday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he plans to eventually reintroduce [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=52.32s)]
*  his 15-week national abortion ban proposal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=58.88s)]
*  Democrats know that abortion is going to shape next year's election as well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=63.52s)]
*  I've got some new reporting out about how the White House views Tuesday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=66.08s)]
*  Great night for Democrats. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=70.12s)]
*  Unclear what it precisely means for President Biden, but it's pretty clear that 2024 is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=71.12s)]
*  going to be shaped by Biden's record, yes, but perhaps more so Donald Trump and his ongoing [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  legal trials as well as abortion. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=82.0s)]
*  Trump and abortion on the ballot box, that's probably good for President Biden. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=84.84s)]
*  That's what Democratic aides think anyway. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=89.36s)]
*  Joining us now, politics reporter for Semaphore, Dave Weigel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=91.88s)]
*  He is in Miami on the heels of the Republican debate there last night. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=95.56s)]
*  Dave, thanks for getting up early for us this morning. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=99.4s)]
*  Let's start with abortion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=101.84s)]
*  It seems like those Republicans on stage really didn't have any consensus as to how they'd [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=103.4s)]
*  handle abortion legislation going forward. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=107.68s)]
*  How panicked is the party right now that this is going to keep being a losing issue for them? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  Quite panicked, and I think it's significant. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=118.2s)]
*  It was a question I was asking some campaigns last night. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=119.76s)]
*  Significant that most of the Republican primary vote, if you add up Donald Trump's numbers [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=122.36s)]
*  and you put them together with Nikki Haley's numbers, he could advocate for Ramoswami, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=126.72s)]
*  is for candidates who don't want to sign a federal abortion ban, who don't think in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=131.32s)]
*  Haley's case that it's feasible that it's going to happen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=135.36s)]
*  In Trump's case, just dodge the question. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=138.32s)]
*  In Ramoswami's case, say, for federalist reasons, he doesn't want to sign one. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  This is something that the one section of Republican base, a dominant section of the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=146.2s)]
*  base, has wanted, and it has not played out in the primary as a litmus test issue. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=150.0s)]
*  These election losses emphasize that, I think, accelerate that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=156.48s)]
*  There is a lack of confidence among Republicans that you can run on this issue and win. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  In Kentucky, you were mentioning there, Democrats played down Cameron just perfectly. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=166.08s)]
*  He was defending Kentucky's full abortion ban with no exceptions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=171.16s)]
*  Very late in the campaign, for the first time, said he supported some exceptions if the legislature [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=175.64s)]
*  would introduce them, which it wasn't going to do. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=180.72s)]
*  Same thing was happening in Ohio. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=183.84s)]
*  They're just poleaxed on this issue. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=185.44s)]
*  So it's, I think, a real factor that the best-performing Republicans right now in this primary say [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=187.14s)]
*  they don't want to go there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=192.44s)]
*  They want to avoid that issue and run on something else. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=193.44s)]
*  So let's talk about Governor Haley there for a minute. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  Lots of analysis this morning suggests she fared the best last night, as she has done [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=198.84s)]
*  perhaps in the other two debates as well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  But I mean, Dave, the polls are such that she is so, so far behind. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=205.28s)]
*  Do you think there's a sense here, though, that she is making a good claim to the mantle [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=209.76s)]
*  of the top Trump alternative? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=213.72s)]
*  That is the goal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=218.48s)]
*  One chorus I heard a little bit last night, before and after the debate, was supporters [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=220.16s)]
*  of Haley saying it's really time for Tim Scott to go. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  There needs to be some sort of consolidation behind her as a Trump alternative because [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=227.16s)]
*  she performs the best in New Hampshire and she is performing the best at any Trump alternative [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=231.16s)]
*  in South Carolina. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=237.2s)]
*  And they're in a bind right now because, especially after Kim Reynolds' endorsement of Ron DeSantis, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=238.2s)]
*  Haley is not second place in Iowa. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=243.72s)]
*  It's a real dilemma if you want Trump to be slowed down on his way to the nomination. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  She is not the second place in Iowa. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=251.72s)]
*  She is in third. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=254.24s)]
*  There's typically three tickets out of Iowa, that's true. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  But it's hard for everyone to game out this primary and say how Nikki Haley could come [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=258.48s)]
*  in third in Iowa and then beat Trump. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=262.36s)]
*  There is no precedent for it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=265.72s)]
*  So, yes, there is a chorus saying time to consolidate behind her if we want to slow [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=267.04s)]
*  this guy down. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=270.88s)]
*  That is tempered by the reality I just talked about and the polling that says if it got [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=272.2s)]
*  down to her one on one in Trump, she would lose 20, 25 points. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=277.04s)]
*  DeSantis would lose by a little bit less. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=282.28s)]
*  Their problem is that Trump is popular in the base for all sorts of reasons that are [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  discussed across this network. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and as we've noted, some of these polls suggest that this candidate's second, voter's [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=290.44s)]
*  second choice candidate is Donald Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  So even if DeSantis were to jump out, let's say, some of those backers would go to Trump [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=297.52s)]
*  and not Haley. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  It's great, national political correspondent for the Washington Post, for Semaphore, formerly [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=302.67999999999995s)]
*  of the Washington Post, at Semaphore, Dave Weigel, thank you so much for joining us this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=306.96s)]
*  morning live from Miami. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=310.64s)]
*  We appreciate that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNRj5OYyrg8&t=312.0s)]
