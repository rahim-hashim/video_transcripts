# Bernie Sanders warns Trump laying the groundwork to deny 2024 results
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c)
*  Over the weekend, Trump indulging in a baseless conspiracy theory about President Biden at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=0.0s)]
*  the DNC. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=5.28s)]
*  He's going to walk into the room and he's going to say, I want my presidency back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=6.28s)]
*  And falsely suggesting large Harris crowds were AI-generated fakes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=11.92s)]
*  So that was some of NBC's reporting earlier this week about Donald Trump's false claim [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=16.36s)]
*  about AI-generated crowds. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=22.2s)]
*  That claim struck Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont, as particularly ludicrous and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=25.06s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=30.86s)]
*  According to the Senator, if Trump can convince his supporters that thousands of people who [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=32.66s)]
*  attended a televised rally don't even exist, it won't be hard to convince them that the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=36.22s)]
*  election results in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan and elsewhere are fake and fraudulent. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now, Chief White House correspondent for the New York Times, Peter Baker. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=47.5s)]
*  Peter, good morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  It does seem like Trump is laying groundwork here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=52.86s)]
*  These comments, as Senator Sanders mentioned about AI, also his belief that switching Biden [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=56.78s)]
*  for Harris atop the ticket is unconstitutional. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=62.82s)]
*  Let's be clear, there's nothing in the Constitution about that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=66.02s)]
*  It seems like he's already preparing for another big lie. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=69.1s)]
*  Yeah, he seems increasingly detached from reality and yet there may be strategy behind [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=72.26s)]
*  it, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=77.66s)]
*  to once again convince his voters that something untoward happened in order to explain a defeat. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=79.66s)]
*  And that's something, of course, he can't accept. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=87.62s)]
*  He can't accept the idea that anybody could possibly beat him, especially, I think, Kamala [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=89.34s)]
*  Harris. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  And so he has to find a way to explain it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  He started this in 2020, let's remember, not after the election when his results came back [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=97.38s)]
*  in, but actually in May, I think, of 2020, he began telling people any result other than [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=102.86s)]
*  his victory would be a sign of a rigged election, would be a cheat, in other words. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=107.42s)]
*  This is his pattern going back years and years and years. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  He's never lost a contest that he acknowledged that he lost. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=116.38s)]
*  He constantly comes up with conspiracy theories and made up versions of reality. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=119.46s)]
*  And what he's doing here, clearly, is laying the groundwork. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=124.34s)]
*  It actually suggests that he feels the heat and is feeling, you know, that he may not [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  be able to pull this off in November. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=132.42s)]
*  Yeah. And on that, we've seen a wave of polls that are all trending toward the vice [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  president's way. And to be clear, we're still several months from Election Day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=138.34s)]
*  This is just a snapshot. But there's no doubt that Democrats have momentum. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  And, Peter, I'm curious your take here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  It's striking that how Trump continues to be flailing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  He hasn't found any real successful attack line against Harris or a way to make this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=150.66s)]
*  race about the issues that would be better for the Republican side. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  No, he's a very I think he's frustrated. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=159.5s)]
*  A lot of Republicans are watching this with great concern, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=161.22s)]
*  They're seeing a candidate who's making stuff up, who is focused on the last candidate [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=164.14s)]
*  so the candidate is actually facing at the moment, who doesn't seem to be, you know, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=169.26s)]
*  getting a traction on his campaign against her. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=174.34s)]
*  There's plenty of avenues of attack. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=177.62s)]
*  Democrats have been prepared, ready, expecting him to go after her on the border, on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  inflation to try to tie the toughest aspects of the Biden-Harris record around her neck. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=186.9s)]
*  And yet instead, he seems to be kind of wandering off in this, you know, old fashioned, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=193.42000000000002s)]
*  very, you know, kind of tire reel of complaints that he has been making now for nine, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=199.38s)]
*  ten years, and actually accentuates the contrast because the contrast that she wants [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=206.1s)]
*  to draw is a generational one. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=211.22s)]
*  It's fresh versus old. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=213.22s)]
*  It's new versus stale. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=215.5s)]
*  Even though she is the incumbent vice president, she's running in effect as a [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=217.34s)]
*  change agent against a guy who for much of the public has been around for a long [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  time and many people, according to polls, are tired of. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  That's an extraordinary inversion of what the dynamic had been just a few weeks ago. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=228.54000000000002s)]
*  And, Peter, so on that, I've got some new [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  reporting this morning about President Biden coming to terms with the idea that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  he's no longer the top of the ticket, but still harboring some frustration at some [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=238.98s)]
*  top Democrats, particularly House Speaker Pelosi, to a lesser extent, former [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=242.42s)]
*  President Obama and Majority Leader Schumer. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=246.94s)]
*  Let's get your insights on that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=250.06s)]
*  And does it threaten at all [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  democratic unity they're trying to project at next week's convention? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, of course, he's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=258.86s)]
*  going to be there at the convention on Monday night. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=260.22s)]
*  That's when he's speaking instead of Thursday night. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=262.9s)]
*  It's a bit of a demotion, obviously. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=264.78s)]
*  And then he's going to leave. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=266.46s)]
*  And that will no longer be Joe Biden's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=267.42s)]
*  convention at that point, it will be Kamala Harris's convention and Kamala Harris's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=269.1s)]
*  party. And you can only imagine how he's feeling and you're doing good reporting on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=272.98s)]
*  exactly that. I mean, and we're not seeing him very much in public. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=277.06s)]
*  He has five months left of his presidency. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=280.78s)]
*  He has a lot of things on the plate. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=283.46s)]
*  He's obviously working on Middle East [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  peace. He's trying very hard to get that ceasefire deal landed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=288.46s)]
*  But beyond that, he has been relatively out of sight. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=291.3s)]
*  He went to New Orleans yesterday and he'll go to Maryland tomorrow for the first [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=296.3s)]
*  joint appearance with Kamala Harris. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=300.26000000000005s)]
*  And then basically he's going to retreat. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  He's going to take some vacation time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=303.26000000000005s)]
*  He's going to spend some time outside of the public spotlight. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=305.3s)]
*  In some ways, of course, you could argue [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=308.74s)]
*  that he's trying to cede the stage to Kamala Harris to give her a lot of room to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=310.22s)]
*  make her own case, to define her identity. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=315.06s)]
*  But on the other hand, I think you're right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=317.62s)]
*  I think he's of course, he's unhappy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  Of course, it's a painful moment. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=320.5s)]
*  It stings to have people that you thought were your closest allies, people like [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=321.86s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama, seemingly in his view, of course, pulling the rug [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=325.18s)]
*  out from under him. And it's not surprising that that would be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=329.82s)]
*  a particularly painful moment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=333.86s)]
*  And one note on Pelosi, the president certainly frustrated with her, but also [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  said he's told allies he understands why she did what she had to do. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=338.94s)]
*  She's ruthless because she always puts the party first. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  Chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, Peter Baker. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=344.9s)]
*  Peter, thank you as always. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=347.18s)]
*  We'll talk to you again soon. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=348.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpfwJq5NO1c&t=355.14s)]
