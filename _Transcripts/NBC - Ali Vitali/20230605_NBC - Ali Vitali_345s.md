# Inside the complicated reality of being America's oldest president: NYT
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E)
*  Welcome back. A new report in the New York Times highlights growing questions about President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden's age as he seeks re-election. The new piece states this, Mr. Biden is the chief executive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=5.44s)]
*  of the world's most powerful nation and has just embarked on a campaign asking voters to keep him [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=12.64s)]
*  in the White House until age 86, drawing more attention to an issue that polls show troubles [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  most Americans and is the source of enormous anxiety among party leaders. The paper goes on [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=24.4s)]
*  to report that some officials in the Biden administration acknowledge they make what they [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  consider reasonable accommodations not to physically tax the president. That includes [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=35.12s)]
*  scheduling most of his public appearances between noon and 4 p.m. and leaving him alone on weekends [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  as much as possible. At the same time, the president has said that age is a legitimate issue, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  but maintains his longevity is an asset, not a liability. In fact, he went on to tell guests [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=52.32s)]
*  at the recent White House Correspondents Association dinner, quote, you say I'm ancient, I say I'm wise. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=58.24s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the authors of that extensive piece, Chief White House [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=67.2s)]
*  Correspondent for the New York Times, Peter Baker. Peter, thanks for joining us this morning. This [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=71.04s)]
*  is a significant storyline. As much as White House officials like to publicly poo poo it, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=76.08s)]
*  polls suggest that age is a top concern among voters, including Democrats who really like [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  President Biden, who like the job he's done, that they say, well, we worry he's too old to do it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=88.88s)]
*  again. So talk to us a little bit more about how the White House and the campaign, how they plan to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=93.6s)]
*  approach this issue as the president plans to face voters again. Yeah, I mean, we wanted to do this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=98.08s)]
*  piece is kind of go look at the actual reality, get past the rhetoric and the, you know, the easy [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  jokes and all of that and look at what's real. Right. And what's real, what's not. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=110.4s)]
*  And what I think we've found is, is, of course, a more complicated reality, which is you have a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=114.48s)]
*  president who is, in fact, very experienced, probably the most experienced person ever to hold [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  the office. And he showed just last week with this debt ceiling deal, that he's able to still [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  bring people together and pass complicated legislation. Even Kevin McCarthy is Republican [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=128.8s)]
*  antagonist. The speaker of the House said he was very tough, very, very on top of this negotiation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=133.52s)]
*  At the same time, we saw on the very same day that the Senate passed that bill, he fell, of course, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=139.92s)]
*  at the Air Force Academy. Looked very embarrassing, a bad optic, the kind of optic that White House [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  aides really cringe at and are worried about. Not that anybody could fall. Anybody can fall. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=148.64s)]
*  You could trip over a sandbag, whether you're 50 or 80. But it's a bad look when you're 80, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=153.2s)]
*  because it raises the questions that they don't want to have to focus on. And that question is, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=157.76s)]
*  of course, not just how he is today, but how he would be all the way until the end of the second [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=162.0s)]
*  term if he were to have it. Now, are they going to make accommodations for him? You haven't seen [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=166.48s)]
*  him, as you pointed out with Darlene, a few minutes ago. You haven't seen him making a particularly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  vigorous campaign schedule yet. They say he will have that. He has been, of course, traveling [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=175.2s)]
*  internationally. Pretty arduous trips. I was with him just a few weeks ago in Japan. They plan to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=181.12s)]
*  show him to be as vigorous as possible, but make the case that it's the accomplishments that matter [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  more than, you know, is his gait slowing and can he sometimes momentarily forget a word or a name [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=193.28s)]
*  or something like that. Yeah. And White House officials and leading Democrats alike point to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=200.08s)]
*  his record and say, look, he's doing a terrific job. But Peter, take us behind closed doors. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=204.0s)]
*  Party leaders, whether Democratic donors, prominent Wall Street Democrats, what are they saying [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=209.6s)]
*  privately? How big of a concern is the president's age and what the alternative could be? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=215.2s)]
*  Well, it's the concern I hear all the time. I don't think I ever speak with any Democrat who [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=220.8s)]
*  doesn't raise that issue. Not that we raise it, they raise it. You know, and I know that there are [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=226.24s)]
*  people in the White House and around, but if I would like to suggest a creation of the media [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=230.56s)]
*  or the Republicans, it's really not. I hear from almost every Democrat I talk to. You know, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=234.64s)]
*  there was a dinner recently, it was told about between, you know, former governors and senators, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=239.28s)]
*  all of whom are roughly in Biden's generation, all of whom thought, no, he shouldn't be running [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=245.44s)]
*  his two. You know, he's too old at this point. There, you know, is the Wall Street, you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=250.32s)]
*  major figure we talk to who said every single donor for the Democratic Party they speak with, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=257.2s)]
*  in fact, brings this issue up. The White House gets calls from local officials asking about the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=263.04s)]
*  president's health. I mean, it's a constant concern among Democrats. Again, as you point out, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=268.24s)]
*  rightly, they all, for the most part, like the president, he's got strong support within the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  party. They think he's doing a good job. They like his policies. They're just concerned about [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=276.64s)]
*  where this goes from here. And as you point out, rightly, it's the alternative. This is the issue [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=280.32s)]
*  because they don't perceive an obvious alternative. Kamala Harris is the vice president. A lot of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  people like her, but she hasn't, in fact, convinced many top Democrats that she's ready for, you know, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  for the job if, in fact, it comes to that. And that's a concern. Who then would step up should [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=294.64s)]
*  they have to think about a plan B? Yeah. And it's unavoidable that age will be a major issue in this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=300.0s)]
*  campaign. We should note Donald Trump, the leading Republican, he's only a couple of years younger [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=304.8s)]
*  than Joe Biden, but other Republicans in the field decades. So we will, of course, be following this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=308.56s)]
*  And you're right. This is a storyline, even if the White House and some Democrats don't want to hear [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=314.48s)]
*  about it on Twitter. Chief White House correspondent for the New York Times, Peter Baker, thank you for [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=318.32s)]
*  the reporting and for being with us this morning. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meplfgxdR6E&t=323.04s)]
