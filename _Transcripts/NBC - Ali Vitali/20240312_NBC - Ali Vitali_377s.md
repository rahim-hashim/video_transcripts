# 35 percent didn't see, hear or read Biden's State of the Union
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo)
*  Polling suggesting that President Joe Biden's state of the union address didn't break through to most Americans at least not yet in the latest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=0.0s)]
*  ABC News IPSA survey 35 percent of adults say they didn't see hear or read the speech [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=7.4s)]
*  That's more than the 29 percent who say it was better than expected and the 12 percent who said it was worse than they expected [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=13.08s)]
*  TV ratings though up from a year ago as for Biden's handling of key issues his approval numbers are still low [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  But they have ticked up slightly since an October poll his biggest improvement comes on the topic of abortion up from 39 percent to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=26.8s)]
*  47 percent the only issue where Biden's approval rating has gone down since October [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=34.52s)]
*  This is handling of the Israel Hamas war which has dropped from 41 percent to 30 percent [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=39.2s)]
*  There have been a few nationals polls zone recent days that now have him up over [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=44.36s)]
*  Donald Trump within the margin of error joining us now why house reporter for politico Eli Stokols [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=48.56s)]
*  He's also the co-author of the West Wing playbook newsletter a must-read every afternoon Eli good to see you this afternoon [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=54.48s)]
*  So let's talk about how the White House feels after the state of the union a lot of buzz [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=60.28s)]
*  I felt like they took the age issue head-on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=64.48s)]
*  Followed up with some campaign travel these poll numbers are sort of middling but not unexpected. What are you hearing? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=67.44s)]
*  Well, I think inside the White House John as you know [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=74.72s)]
*  They feel pretty good about the way that came off and at least settling some of the nerves within the Democratic Party [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=76.84s)]
*  About Biden's vitality an ability to stand up an argument through November would they like to see the polls? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=81.91999999999999s)]
*  Showing a bigger bounce [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely, but you know, I think that they know this is a long haul to November the campaign in Wilmington [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=90.64s)]
*  They are just starting to really press their financial advantage over the Trump campaign [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=97.88s)]
*  Just starting to launch TV ads sort of highlighting the Biden record while also drawing sharp contrast with Trump [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  So it's going to take time to sort of press their advantage they believe and and really, you know within the White House [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=107.76s)]
*  There are also some questions about whether approval ratings are really the best measurement of where the president stands or whether he has a good [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=114.5s)]
*  Chance to win reelection. I'm thinking back to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=121.24s)]
*  2022 after Emmanuel Macron won the reelection in France his then chief of staff Ron Klain tweeted, you know [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Oh look a president can win reelection with a low approval number [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean there's an understanding that approval rating now in American politics given how polarized everything is given how crabby people are [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=133.54s)]
*  You know, I think that there's just a sense that approval rating may not be the best metric [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=141.02s)]
*  It's hard to get your approval rating much over 40% these days [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=145.9s)]
*  Once you've been in office for any stretch of time. Yeah good point about the approval ratings and the nation's crappiness [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=148.98s)]
*  So Eli we just indicated there that the president has seen his approval rating slip on his handling of the Israel Hamas war [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=155.18s)]
*  We've a lot of that is from members of his own party who think he's not doing enough to help the civilians there in Gaza [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=161.06s)]
*  Not pushing Israel enough, but we've got some new reporting [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=167.44s)]
*  We broke last night about how there will be a red line with Rafa [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=169.94s)]
*  And if Israel goes into raw feel a full-scale invasion that President Biden very well may consider conditioning military aid to that nation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=174.58s)]
*  Which they have not done so far [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=181.78s)]
*  tell us about what we were the thinking behind that and also just the both the big picture political ramifications of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=183.3s)]
*  President Biden potentially [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=190.14s)]
*  Changing tactics there in his handling of Netanyahu in the war [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=192.3s)]
*  Well, this has been become a political liability for the president. He's not controlling the war on either side, but as the American [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=196.06s)]
*  Commander-in-chief there is some influence that you would think that that Biden would have over Israel a really important ally [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=203.46s)]
*  But at this point that has not been the case Netanyahu is prosecuting the war however [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=210.04s)]
*  He likes and we have seen Biden sort of ratchet up the rhetoric going back a month or so [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=214.32s)]
*  When he first said Israel's campaign in Gaza was over the top and we have kind of seen the the slow [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=219.2s)]
*  Ratcheting up of the rhetoric now talking about [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=225.44s)]
*  Red lines Netanyahu pushing back saying he doesn't really care about Biden's red line [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  His red line is not having another October 7th attack [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=232.64s)]
*  You know so it seems like they are really talking past one another and it would be remarkable if Biden decided [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  To condition aid on on whether or not Israel sort of scales back its operation [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=242.72s)]
*  I don't know. You know the White House wouldn't really go further than what what Biden said in his interview on Sunday [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  Or on Saturday rather with Jonathan Capehart, so I don't know how [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=255.56s)]
*  Likely we are to see this in the coming weeks, but there's a real sense [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=260.59999999999997s)]
*  That this is hurting the president politically you can't just wish this war away [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not just going to disappear by the fall [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=269.68s)]
*  It is a real problem, and it's a problem beyond just Michigan with younger voters [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=272.4s)]
*  And so I think there's an awareness of that and at least rhetorically you're seeing the president recalibrate a little bit whether they go further with [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=277.32s)]
*  Actual you know changes in policy toward Israel which would be a dramatic step [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=284.76s)]
*  You know I think a lot of that does depend on sort of how things go after Ramadan [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=289.2s)]
*  What this potential new Israeli offensive looks like and Eli lastly staying with foreign policy very briefly leaders of Poland will be at the White House [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=292.76s)]
*  Today to talk about the Ukraine war what does the White House hope to get out of this meeting? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think just to show unity [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=305.84s)]
*  I mean Poland obviously would be the most affected NATO ally if Russia were to ever expand the war beyond Ukraine [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=307.64s)]
*  To two leaders in Poland who are on opposite sides domestically but on the same side with Ukraine [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=313.28s)]
*  And they come to Washington a time when Ukraine aid is stuck [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=319.0s)]
*  And so I think they are trying to show a united front even as the Ukraine the pro-ukraine coalition in the West [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=321.96s)]
*  Seems to be a little bit stuck in the mud and I think you know between the Ukraine's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=328.48s)]
*  Story and the Israel story [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=333.84s)]
*  We are seeing an American president who had big ambitions to reassert American leadership on the on the world stage [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=335.88s)]
*  And we're seeing at this point that that looks increasingly challenging and hard to do given the politics [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=341.6s)]
*  Here and also the politics in Europe [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=348.44s)]
*  Terrific stuff as always from White House reporter for politico our friend Eli Stokos Eli. Thank you very much and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=351.08s)]
*  You [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRc4IRT6_zo&t=363.44s)]
