# Trump calls for government shutdown over unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s)
*  Donald Trump is now calling for a government shutdown over unsubstantiated claims of voter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=0.0s)]
*  fraud. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=6.08s)]
*  The former president said late last week that Republicans in Congress should shut down the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=7.44s)]
*  government if Democrats don't agree to legislation barring non-citizens from voting. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Which we note again, that's already illegal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=19.0s)]
*  Trump continues to claim without evidence that many non-citizens voted in the past presidential [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=23.92s)]
*  election. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=29.2s)]
*  The comments come as Congress faces a deadline by the end of the month to pass a spending [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=30.68s)]
*  bill to prevent a partial government shutdown. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional Investigations reporter for the Washington Post, Jackie Alamani. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=39.36s)]
*  She is also an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=44.66s)]
*  Jackie, good to see you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=47.4s)]
*  So let's talk about this idea of a government shutdown. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  First of all, Trump's claims, they're nonsensical. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=53.32s)]
*  There are already laws in place to prevent non-citizens from voting. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=56.0s)]
*  How are Republicans reacting to his demand? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=60.28s)]
*  Yeah, John, you already have Speaker Mike Johnson pandering to former President Donald [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=64.0s)]
*  Trump as we get close to election day, trying to attach what Democrats are calling this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=70.4s)]
*  poison pill, the SAVE Act, to any sort of continuing resolution that needs to be agreed [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=75.32s)]
*  the month or else we could have a potential government shutdown. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=81.16s)]
*  That being said, the politics around the SAVE Act, even though voting as a non-citizen [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=86.24s)]
*  is already illegal in the U.S. and this is sort of a fear tactic, as Democrats are calling [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  it, try to scaremonger ahead of the November election, there were five Democrats that voted [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=100.0s)]
*  for this in July. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=105.4s)]
*  The bigger problem for Republicans here is that Mike Johnson doesn't have the 218 votes [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=108.1s)]
*  that he needs from Republicans to get through any sort of continuing resolution, at least [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=112.74s)]
*  in this moment. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=117.62s)]
*  They're still, as we've talked about really for the last two years of this Congress, there's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=118.62s)]
*  still not enough Republicans who want to vote for any funding at all, even though it's just [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=123.82s)]
*  bootstrapping the government until really next March, when Republicans are hoping that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=128.1s)]
*  Donald Trump will already be in the White House. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  So beyond Trump's threats, there are others on the far right in the GOP here also potentially [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=135.14s)]
*  pushing for a shutdown. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=139.94s)]
*  I mean, that just seems like terrible politics. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=141.7s)]
*  Just two months ahead of an election year, Republicans likely would take the blame for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=144.5s)]
*  a shutdown. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=148.1s)]
*  What are the chances this could happen? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=149.1s)]
*  How nervous are some of the GOP that it could? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=150.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=153.82s)]
*  You make a really good point. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=154.82s)]
*  And I should also note that this proposal is also dead on arrival in the Senate and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=155.82s)]
*  at the White House and would never ultimately make it through. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=160.74s)]
*  We get kicked back to Republicans to deal with all over again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=163.42000000000002s)]
*  But there are a handful of moderate Republicans who are already worried about their electoral [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  prospects, especially in the wake of Joe Biden passing the torch to Kamala Harris and all [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=172.10000000000002s)]
*  of these numbers at a state level really reshifting and jiggering that this is a bad electoral [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=177.9s)]
*  tactic, especially causing a shutdown right before the election. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=183.34s)]
*  That being said, I think we're going to see the sort of rigmarole that we usually see [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=188.64s)]
*  when it comes to a government shutdown, which is eventually, even though there's going to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=192.64s)]
*  be very limited time, Republicans and Democrats will sit down at the table. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  But they're going to have to pass 12 different bills, which is going to be quite a bit of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  a lift. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  They'll come back next week and hopefully pick this up ASAP. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  So yeah, you just mentioned Congress about to return after its August recess in for only [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=211.44s)]
*  a short time before heading out onto the campaign trail. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=215.88s)]
*  What else has to get done here? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=219.32s)]
*  Oh, there's there's quite a number of things. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's it was sort of starting already to feel like a lame duck session, but there's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  actually some some big ticket items that need to be done other than funding the government. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=229.16s)]
*  There's the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Reauthorization Act. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=233.32s)]
*  So for the first time since 2014, this massive package that already made it through the House [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=237.8s)]
*  and now needs to get kicked back from the Senate to to to actually vote on the final [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=242.8s)]
*  package. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=250.44s)]
*  We're told that the Senate is expected to have a markup of that final package around [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=252.12s)]
*  the rules that dictate the way workers are treated in the workplace. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=257.44s)]
*  That is going to to be expected at some point in November. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=262.28s)]
*  That's something that I think Republicans and Democrats realize is a priority to at [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=266.56s)]
*  least get done before November. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=270.16s)]
*  And Jackie, let's turn to November and indeed the battle for both the House and Senate. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=272.32s)]
*  What's the latest the party insiders are telling you as to where they think this will go? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=276.96s)]
*  Who will have control of those two chambers? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's really interesting because I know when everyone left for the summer, as you [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=284.96s)]
*  know, as we repeatedly discussed, people were in a state of panic over over Joe Biden. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=291.2s)]
*  It was after his disastrous debate performance and the the numbers and the polling that that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  were seeing the downstream effects of Biden's impact on members at the bottom of the ticket [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=301.44s)]
*  were not good. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  That has has completely changed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=308.96s)]
*  We're going now into a Congress where Democrats are seeing a renewed source of hope and energy [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=311.23999999999995s)]
*  to to potentially recapture the Democratic majority in the House and maybe maybe maintain [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  that majority in the Senate. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=322.96s)]
*  That being said, there are a number of tight races that we're watching closely from from [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=325.2s)]
*  you know, Montana, especially in the Senate, to to as as we repeatedly discuss this, this [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=331.52s)]
*  very tight margin in the House. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=340.55999999999995s)]
*  Republicans have a five seat majority there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=343.08s)]
*  There are a number of people who are running for reelection in these swinging moderate [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=346.11999999999995s)]
*  districts who are who do still maintain a lead. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=351.4s)]
*  But the Democrats are are planning on now running with Kamala at the top of the ticket [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=355.68s)]
*  and are feeling much more positive about their prospects. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=363.04s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. Odds are both houses decided by razor thin margins. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=365.84s)]
*  You [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ShS2RebP-s&t=384.88s)]
