# Trump poised to dominate Super Tuesday as Haley makes last stand: WaPo
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4)
*  The Supreme Court ruled today that Donald Trump could stay on the ballot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=0.0s)]
*  No, I think that was important. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=6.58s)]
*  We don't ever want some elected official in a state or anybody else saying who can and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=10.38s)]
*  can't be on a ballot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=16.52s)]
*  This is America. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=17.64s)]
*  This is America. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=18.64s)]
*  Look, I'll defeat Donald Trump fair and square, but I want him on that ballot. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=19.64s)]
*  That was Nikki Haley in Texas yesterday weighing in on the Supreme Court ruling that Donald [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=28.26s)]
*  Trump can stay on Colorado's primary ballot. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=32.36s)]
*  Joining us now, national political reporter for the Washington Post, Hannah Knowles. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=35.46s)]
*  Hannah, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=39.54s)]
*  So you've got a new piece that has the headline, Trump poised to dominate Super Tuesday as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=40.82s)]
*  Haley makes her last stand. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  So let's start there with Haley. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=47.660000000000004s)]
*  She has, throughout this process, vowed to stay in through Super Tuesday. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=50.24s)]
*  Super Tuesday has arrived. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  She's not expected to win many, if any, contests today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=56.74s)]
*  So if that's the case, what happens to her next? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=60.88s)]
*  That is the question. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=63.74s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people who think maybe she could drop out pretty soon after [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=64.94s)]
*  this, but she hasn't announced anything. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=70.94s)]
*  So what are her sources, what are her advisors saying in terms of, you know, it's a truism, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=73.7s)]
*  right, that these campaigns, they stay afloat as long as they have the money to do so. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=78.38s)]
*  We know some of her big donors have backed away, but does she have enough cash to keep [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=83.7s)]
*  going for a while? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Were she to choose to? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  That is the interesting thing, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=90.74s)]
*  I mean, she, a number of people have made that point. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=91.74s)]
*  Usually the campaign would run out of money at this point, and Nikki Haley still has donors [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=94.86s)]
*  who, you know, they want to see her fight and they want to see her sort of carry the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=99.34s)]
*  banner for that old guard, like Reagan wing of the party that's still around despite the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=103.08s)]
*  Trump takeover. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=108.32s)]
*  But I just, I can't imagine what she would gain from going further at this point. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=110.64s)]
*  What would be the rationale if she were to go forward, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=116.36s)]
*  That, you know, we know that Trump's criminal trial, the one in New York, starts in now [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=119.28s)]
*  under three weeks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=124.08s)]
*  Is the idea that she could just stay around just in case something were to happen there [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=125.7s)]
*  or some other sort of unexpected event that could derail Trump? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=129.76s)]
*  There is a case for, you know, stick around and collect delegates as long as you can to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=134.52s)]
*  be sort of that person who could swoop in if something happens. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=139.96s)]
*  But that's also looking less and less likely, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=143.88s)]
*  Because we're seeing that we might not have, you know, a lot of these trials could get [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  delayed until after the election. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=151.22s)]
*  And so it's looking less likely that Trump could have that moment of legal derailment. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=153.06s)]
*  So Hannah, you've been writing about how Haley, though she's only won the one contest, the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  one in Washington, D.C., she's put up pretty good numbers in others. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=161.36s)]
*  She's pulled in a significant percentage of the vote in some contests. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=164.58s)]
*  I'm thinking Iowa, I'm thinking New Hampshire, I'm thinking particularly South Carolina. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=167.56s)]
*  Talk to us, if you will, about the implications for what that could mean for Republicans and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=172.0s)]
*  namely Donald Trump's success in November. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=176.72s)]
*  Yeah, so she'll point out that her best showing so far was in New Hampshire. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=179.04s)]
*  She got 43 percent. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=183.2s)]
*  And that's not, you know, a tiny minority is what she says. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=184.46s)]
*  She says that this is a sign that Donald Trump has work to do if he wants to win over that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=188.36s)]
*  particularly independents and college educated voters. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=194.56s)]
*  But at the same time, it actually looks like the Republican coalition is more united right [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  now behind Trump than the Democratic coalition is behind Biden. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, even though Biden is cruising in the primary, he kind of in some ways has [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=208.68s)]
*  more to be nervous about right now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=213.02s)]
*  So talk to us a little bit more about Trump, some of the vulnerabilities that Republicans, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=215.06s)]
*  those that don't see as potential liabilities for the former president in November. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=220.92s)]
*  Well, they would point to the 91 felony charges against him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=226.28s)]
*  They would point to just what he says every day. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=230.27999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is not someone who is has the posture of I am trying to unite the big tent [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, every day he says stuff that alienates a certain group. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=241.11999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we just discussed with our last guest, Susan DelPersio, about how he said he doesn't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  want the Mitt Romney or his supporters. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=249.5s)]
*  Well, those are exactly the kind of votes you need in what will be a tight, tight election. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=250.94s)]
*  National Political Reporter for the Washington Post, Hannah Noles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=256.82s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning on this Super Tuesday. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=258.82s)]
*  And of course, we will have complete coverage all day long and tonight of the election results. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=261.9s)]
*  An important moment here in the 2024 campaign. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOIDec-Fq4&t=266.66s)]
