# 'The last great hope': CIA Director enroute to broker Israel-Hamas hostage release deal
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0)
*  Good morning, Mark. Let's start with the discussion on hostages. CIA Director Manuel is in route to try to broker a deal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=0.0s)]
*  He's become one of President Biden's most trusted hands in this matter. What do we think happens here? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=8.8s)]
*  Hamas and Israel, they're still, as we just noted, they're not in agreement yet as to what needs to get done. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=14.64s)]
*  What's your analysis? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=20.72s)]
*  So, Jonathan, I think this is the last great hope for some kind of deal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=23.279999999999998s)]
*  I don't believe that CIA Director Bill Burns, Mossad Director David Barnea, the Qatari Prime Minister, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=28.4s)]
*  as well as the Egyptian Intelligence Chief, plus even reportedly the Israeli Shin Bet domestic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=35.6s)]
*  internal service director, Ron Navarro, I don't think they would all descend upon Europe if there [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=40.16s)]
*  wasn't some kind of hope. So what does this mean now? In essence, the deal that Israel has put [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=43.6s)]
*  for perhaps a one to two month ceasefire, and then you have this release of hostages, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=49.36s)]
*  you know, over 130 actually less are unfortunately alive. I think there's 20 or 25 bodies that Hamas [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  has, but in return Israel would release security prisoners, but that's it. And so the real sticking [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  point is that Israel does not want to have a cessation in hostilities. So I think this meeting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=67.92s)]
*  is designed in essence because of the presence of both the Egyptians and the Qataris. This meeting [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=72.80000000000001s)]
*  is designed to put pressure on Hamas to accept what for them would be a limited deal, but this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=77.28s)]
*  is it in terms of red lines for Israel. I don't think they will ever agree to a permanent cessation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  in hostilities. So really interesting development. And again, the meeting should take place probably [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=85.84s)]
*  this weekend in Europe. I think France was the location that I heard. Yeah, Paris, a likely [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=90.4s)]
*  option there. Certainly Israel has not always taken the United States advice as to how to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=95.76s)]
*  conduct themselves during this war. Let's shift to the Red Sea now and the role that China could be [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=100.88s)]
*  playing. Jake Sullivan, as noted, meeting with the foreign minister there, you know, and it's been [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=105.36s)]
*  pointed out that the Red Sea shipping, that any kind of hindrance there actually impacts China even [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=110.56s)]
*  more than the United States. So it would seem logical that they would play a role. Talk to us [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=115.2s)]
*  about whether you think that Beijing will step up their efforts, but also just what does this tell [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  us big picture about potentially improving relations between the United States and China? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=123.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is a really good move because the issue of kind of the Red Sea is not the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=129.44s)]
*  Houthis, you know, per se. This is the idea of keeping the international economy going. It's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=134.72s)]
*  keeping shipping lanes open. And China has a lot in its favor that they would want this to continue. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=139.68s)]
*  So, you know, the idea that we're going to engage the Chinese is smart. China could put some pressure [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=147.92s)]
*  on Tehran. And Jonathan, as we've talked many times before, anytime the U.S. and China are talking, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=153.2s)]
*  that's better than where relations were in the past. Will this have an effect, perhaps? But it's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=157.84s)]
*  the right move by the administration, and I'm glad to see that this is occurring. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=162.24s)]
*  And Mark, very briefly, as we know the border talks in Congress have bogged down, meaning [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=165.68s)]
*  aid not getting to Ukraine. Give us your brief analysis. Just how dire is the situation going [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=170.8s)]
*  for Kiev as they're running out of ammunition? Well, the Ukrainians have been very clear that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=174.88s)]
*  this is really serious right now. They are running out of ammunition. And so, you know, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=179.36s)]
*  the notion that domestic kind of issues in the United States is prohibiting aid getting to Ukraine, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=183.12s)]
*  in my view, is a kind of someone who was a foreign policy practitioner. This is appalling. This is [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=189.92s)]
*  the reputation of the United States. And there is a deal on the table right now that all sides could [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=194.96s)]
*  agree to. But unfortunately, the House Republicans pressured by former President Trump are going to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=200.48s)]
*  reject this. And at the end of the day, this is the reputation of the United States on the line here. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=205.44s)]
*  And of course, this could cost some Ukrainian lives. This is really serious. And you can only [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=210.4s)]
*  hope that somehow this will be resolved. But I'm not so sure. And we've heard from senior [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=214.88s)]
*  lawmakers in recent days that if America fails to follow through on its commitment to Ukraine, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  the rest of the world will never take us at our word again. Retired CIA Officer Mark Palmoropoulos, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=223.92s)]
*  thank you for starting us off this morning. We really appreciate it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=228.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk8vaIV6U0&t=244.88s)]
