# Several GOP lawmakers say they support IVF treatments
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU)
*  Republican lawmakers are divided over the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling that embryos can be considered children. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=0.0s)]
*  The governors of Georgia, Tennessee, and New Hampshire, to name a few, have all said they support IVF treatments, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=7.0s)]
*  this despite signing restrictive anti-abortion measures in their states. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=13.0s)]
*  In the GOP-led House, several New York representatives have denounced the ruling. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=18.0s)]
*  Don Bacon of Nebraska told Axios he does not support restrictions on the treatment. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=22.0s)]
*  South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace also criticized it, saying the nation should do more to protect IVF. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=27.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Nikki Haley appears to be toeing the line between supporting and criticizing the court's decision. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=33.0s)]
*  Earlier this week, Haley told NBC News she believes embryos are babies, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=40.0s)]
*  but is now clarifying that comment, saying parents need to have options. Take a listen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=45.0s)]
*  One, you want to make sure that embryos are protected and respected in the way that they're supposed to be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=52.0s)]
*  Two, you want to make sure that parents have the rights to make those decisions with their doctor as they go through in what they're going to do. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=58.0s)]
*  And we want to make sure, whatever we do, that we have plenty of opportunities and availability for fertility treatments to go forward. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=66.0s)]
*  We don't want fertility treatments to shut down. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=75.0s)]
*  We don't want them to stop doing IVF treatments. We don't want them to stop doing artificial insemination. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=78.0s)]
*  We want to make sure that people are able to have these blessings. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=83.0s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Ali Vitale, who is on the ground in South Carolina, covering the state's primary, which is being held tomorrow. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=87.0s)]
*  Ali, you were also the first one who talked to Nikki Haley about the ruling on Wednesday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=97.0s)]
*  What do you make of the evolution of her comments? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=102.0s)]
*  I think it makes sense, given the way that people initially latched on to the comments that she made to me, Jonathan, saying that embryos to her are babies. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=104.0s)]
*  That was in response to a question I asked her just broadly about the ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court and treating these IVF made embryos as children, giving them those protections. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=114.0s)]
*  Haley was clear that her view is that embryos are babies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=125.0s)]
*  But now what we're watching is her try to say that that's her personal view and that she wants the policy to make it easier for families to have conversations with their doctors, patients to have conversations with their caregivers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=129.0s)]
*  Here's the problem with that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=141.0s)]
*  We've seen this in the post-Obs era, the idea that patients want to have these kinds of candid, sensitive, nuanced conversations with their doctors about their reproductive care. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=143.0s)]
*  In this case, we're talking about IVF treatments, the idea of wanting to have a child. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=153.0s)]
*  But in the post-Dobbs era, what we've seen is that those conversations become more difficult because it's harder to have conversations about women's reproductive health writ large. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=158.0s)]
*  The more there are rules and regulations provided around this, the more difficult it becomes for a position like Haley's to actually come to fruition. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=168.0s)]
*  And I pressed her on this in real time, Jonathan. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=177.0s)]
*  I asked about the possible chilling effect that views like the courts in Alabama could have on the actual practice of this health care for IVF. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=180.0s)]
*  And Haley said that it needs to be treated sensitively and in a nuanced position. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=190.0s)]
*  But again, it's new that she's coming out now and saying that the policy has to keep that in mind because candidly, in this post-Roe, post-Dobbs era, that's not always been the case. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=194.0s)]
*  And we have heard from time and again, patients and providers both who don't know the kind of care they can seek, who don't know the kind of care they can get, whether it's around abortion. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=204.0s)]
*  And now that same confusion being applied to IVF, we also saw that same confusion around access to the abortion pill, otherwise known as Mifprisstone. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=214.0s)]
*  All of this is now being called into question because of things that courts have decided. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=223.0s)]
*  So, Allie, President Biden's campaign has squarely gone after Donald Trump for this ruling in Alabama, saying it's one of the ramifications of the Dobbs decision. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=228.0s)]
*  Trump himself, silent on the matter, sort of unlike him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=237.0s)]
*  Do we have any sense as to where he and his campaign will come down on this? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=241.0s)]
*  And just more broadly, how is this going to play politically as 2024 approaches? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=245.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's been silent on the matter. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=252.0s)]
*  And I think you and I both know that that's a rarity, as you point out, but also be probably a new sign of what they're trying to do with this version of the Trump campaign. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=253.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=263.0s)]
*  Trump campaign 3.0 at this point. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=264.0s)]
*  They want him to be slightly more disciplined. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=266.0s)]
*  He has in the past taken credit for putting together the Supreme Court and the overturning of Roe. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=269.0s)]
*  But on this one, he's being more quiet. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=275.0s)]
*  In part, it's because he doesn't necessarily do interviews in venues that will ask him tougher questions like this, but also because I think his campaign realizes this is a really tough issue. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=277.0s)]
*  You're watching Republicans who are being asked about this now struggle to find the line. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=288.0s)]
*  Senator Tommy Tuberville yesterday, for example, of Alabama, struggling to figure out how he would or if he would regulate the regulate positions around access to IVF through the lens of an anti-abortion posture that most Republicans have taken. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=293.0s)]
*  So I do think that this is yet another instance of going on the policy merry-go-round and watching the ways that Republicans will struggle on this. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=309.0s)]
*  That's probably why Trump's been quiet. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=317.0s)]
*  And it's the thing that you and I probably hear about both from Republican operatives for the general. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=319.0s)]
*  Abortion is going to be such a tough issue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=323.0s)]
*  And this is another reminder of why. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=326.0s)]
*  It certainly is. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=328.0s)]
*  And we'll be following it every step of the way. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=330.0s)]
*  NBC News, Capitol Hill correspondent, Ali Vitale. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=332.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=334.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyMpOXKbCGU&t=347.0s)]
