# Speaker Johnson meets with Trump at Mar-a-Lago
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE)
*  Speaking of Trump, he hosted House Speaker Mike Johnson in person for the first time [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=0.0s)]
*  just days after Johnson publicly backed Trump for president. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  Two sources familiar with the meeting tell NBC News that the two men gathered last night [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=10.06s)]
*  at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=14.46s)]
*  Speaker Johnson essentially broke with tradition when he backed Trump for president because [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=18.78s)]
*  congressional party leaders typically hold back from endorsing a candidate until after [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=23.86s)]
*  a presumptive nominee is established. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=28.96s)]
*  But of course, in 2020, it was Johnson that led an amicus brief that was later signed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  by 100 Republicans in support of a Texas lawsuit that sought to invalidate the election results [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=37.04s)]
*  in four battleground states won by President Joe Biden. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=44.32s)]
*  Johnson cast his lot with the big lie then and is doing so again. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ujHBfsmBnE&t=48.2s)]
