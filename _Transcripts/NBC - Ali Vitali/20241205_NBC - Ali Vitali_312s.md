# House committee to meet to discuss next steps in Gaetz report
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4)
*  The House Ethics Committee is expected to meet today to discuss next steps after it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=0.0s)]
*  previously declined to release its report on former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=4.9s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Sean Casten of Illinois is looking to force a vote to release the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  years-long investigation into accusations against Gaetz. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Those claims involve sacks of the minor and illicit drug use. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=20.46s)]
*  Gaetz, who was Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general before withdrawing his nomination, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=24.68s)]
*  has denied all wrongdoing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  He's also resigned from Congress. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=31.16s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC political analyst Juanita Tolliver. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=33.56s)]
*  Juanita, good to see you. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=37.24s)]
*  Let's talk about this debate here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=38.6s)]
*  Why do you suppose Congressman Casten has deemed it so important to release this report? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=40.96s)]
*  And what big picture can this tell us, perhaps, about the state of the Republican Party and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=46.92s)]
*  who Donald Trump had wished to put in power? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=53.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  I think that big picture moment is a key motivation for Representative Casten as he continues [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=58.12s)]
*  to push for this resolution that he wants to bring to the House floor for a vote to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=63.28s)]
*  release this report. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=68.92s)]
*  I think he's also motivated by the tensions that have been previously reported from the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=69.92s)]
*  House Ethics Committee, which let us remember the context of the ending of their last meeting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=74.0s)]
*  and their last vote on this, after which the report was not released. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=79.44s)]
*  Representative Gaetz said there was a consensus to not release the report. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=82.68s)]
*  Representative Susan Wilds, a Democrat, felt the need to call him out for that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  She called it a betrayal of the process. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=90.92s)]
*  Knowing that they're going back in that meeting today, I think Representative Casten is trying [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  to apply pressure again to the Ethics Committee to release this report, because in his mind, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  it's something that needs to be discussed as this is who Donald Trump wanted to lead [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=102.92s)]
*  the DOJ, as well as the reality that Gaetz may have future political aspirations. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  I do appreciate you mentioning that this is a years-long investigation, because this has [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  been something that the House Ethics Committee has been probing for three years, and it extends [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=116.84s)]
*  to include questions about bribery or acceptance of gifts, as well as misuse of campaign funds. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=121.64000000000001s)]
*  And so one of the other key themes that Casten has been emphasizing is standards within Congress [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=127.68s)]
*  and what members of Congress are expected to do as leaders and representatives in this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=134.88s)]
*  And whether or not that standard is something that the Republicans believe should be upheld [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  as well as emphasized in whatever is included in this report that prompted Matt Gaetz to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  exit Congress as abruptly as he did last month. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, now I think that's a good point. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=153.56s)]
*  It's an effort to try to restore and enforce some sort of norm, some sort of guidelines [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=154.96s)]
*  when Donald Trump, of course, tries to barrel through most of them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  So on that same idea, Juanita, give us your read here on, you know, look, Trump, he won. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=164.56s)]
*  He won the popular vote this time around as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  Republicans control both houses of Congress. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=172.8s)]
*  So in a sense, he walks the door with a lot of momentum. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=174.96s)]
*  He'd be unstoppable. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=177.36s)]
*  But we are seeing Republican senators stand up to him, at least a little bit. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  John Thune, majority leader. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=183.12s)]
*  We saw them, they pushed back on the Gaetz pick. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=184.8s)]
*  Gaetz had to give it up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  We're now seeing a lot of resistance to Pete Hegseth as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  Are you reading in, should there be signs of hope here that Republican senators and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=192.24s)]
*  just the institution of the Senate are willing to do their part? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think the Gaetz situation was uniquely interesting because he had minimal friends [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=201.24s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  He'd made a lot, he'd ruffled a lot of feathers over the years and had a lot of people who [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  were not supportive of him generally. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=211.96s)]
*  So I think his ouster was different from what we're seeing with Hegseth. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=214.56s)]
*  And so it remains to be seen if Republican senators are going to stand up to Donald Trump [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=218.0s)]
*  or some of these highly unqualified candidates he's putting up as nominees for key cabinet [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=221.56s)]
*  positions. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=226.44s)]
*  The other reality is on Capitol Hill, especially in the House of Representatives, Republicans [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=227.44s)]
*  are working with a minuscule margin of leadership here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=231.84s)]
*  And so when you consider that they can only afford to lose potentially one vote in the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  next Congress to get anything done, I think it reemphasizes the fact that yes, Donald [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=241.08s)]
*  Trump won the election. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Republicans won the House, but they do not have a mandate from the nation, especially [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  as it applies to different agenda items, whether that's repealing the Affordable Care Act or [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=251.28s)]
*  gutting government funding, which Trump would need Congress to approve in terms of his [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  government efficiency agenda, as he so calls it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=260.52s)]
*  And so that margin, I think, is something that will also come into play when he tries to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=263.72s)]
*  influence Congress, as well as when members of Congress, especially Democrats, potentially [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  make their own demands. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=273.2s)]
*  I'm looking at House Minority Leader Hawking Jeffries, especially in that moment when [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=274.36s)]
*  Republicans at some point are going to have to come to House Democrats for support on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=278.72s)]
*  a range of issues, whether that's funding the government or anything else. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no question there, particularly considering how tiny the Republicans margin is in the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  House. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tks3h16wpN4&t=291.28000000000003s)]
