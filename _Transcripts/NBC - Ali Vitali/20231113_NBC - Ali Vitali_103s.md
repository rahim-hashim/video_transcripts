# Defense to begin presentation in New York fraud trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY)
*  With the latest in a legal case that could wipe out Donald Trump's business empire here in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, the former president's legal team will begin to present its defense in the New York State $250 million civil fraud trial. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=7.0s)]
*  The state attorney general's office rested its case last week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=16.0s)]
*  Trump and his namesake company are accused of defrauding New York State numerous times by knowingly using false financial records to receive better loans and deals. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=20.0s)]
*  Trump's legal team is expected to argue that a disclaimer clause in the financial documents frees the company from any liability. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=33.0s)]
*  Trump attempted to pull out that document while on the stand last week, but the judge stopped him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=42.0s)]
*  The judge, Arthur Engorin, already found the Trump organization liable for fraud before the trial even began. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=49.0s)]
*  The Hill reports in his ruling ahead of the trial, Engorin rejected the defense's argument about the disclaimer clause by noting another part of that same passage reads, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=57.0s)]
*  Donald J. Trump is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statement. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=68.0s)]
*  Donald Trump Jr. is expected to take the stand again today for the defense. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=75.0s)]
*  His father is expected to testify again at some point. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaDxoO5B4yY&t=79.0s)]
