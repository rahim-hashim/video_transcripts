# Title 42 expires amid influx in border arrivals
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o)
*  We begin with a new overnight. The pandemic era immigration policy known as Title 42 has officially expired. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=0.0s)]
*  Already we're seeing a massive influx of migrants at the southern border. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=7.36s)]
*  Homeland Security officials say illegal border crossings topped 10,000 per day this week, the highest levels ever. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=11.96s)]
*  The Biden administration is urging those seeking entry into the United States to use lawful pathways. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=20.8s)]
*  We are clear-eyed about the challenges we are likely to face in the days and weeks ahead and we are ready to meet them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=30.0s)]
*  I want to be very clear. Our borders are not open. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=37.12s)]
*  People who cross our border unlawfully and without a legal basis to remain will be promptly processed and removed. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=41.64s)]
*  According to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, there are 24,000 border patrol agents and officers at the southwest border, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=51.36s)]
*  as well as thousands of troops, contractors and asylum officers. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=60.72s)]
*  On Capitol Hill, Republicans say the White House isn't doing nearly enough to secure the southern border. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=66.48s)]
*  The Biden administration's reckless policies have created chaos on our southern border. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=75.08000000000001s)]
*  President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have proven they are either incapable, unwilling or uninterested in defending and maintaining our borders. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas will be a guest with us later today on Morning Joe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=96.48s)]
*  Joining us now live from El Paso, Texas, NBC's Bre Jackson. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=103.64s)]
*  Bre, good morning. Title 42, of course, expired just a few hours ago. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=108.52s)]
*  What are you seeing so far where you are? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. Well, things are pretty quiet here so far. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=119.8s)]
*  So as you can see behind me, we have the border fencing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  This is the border between El Paso and Mexico. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  There have been some law enforcement agents here as long as we've been here early this morning, but it's been a fairly quiet morning. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=129.44s)]
*  But we have seen a lot of migrants coming through El Paso over the past couple of days that we've been here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=137.0s)]
*  And they've come for various reasons from what we've heard when we've talked with them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=142.84s)]
*  Some are coming for a better life. Some are coming for family. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=147.28s)]
*  But the situation here, it has gotten increasingly. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  We've seen migrants coming through this area throughout the week. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=154.96s)]
*  The mayor has told us that he is expecting this to be a challenge as they do expect more people to cross the border. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=157.92s)]
*  So one woman I spoke with at a local shelter here, she says she traveled through seven countries in order to cross the border with her family. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=164.6s)]
*  She has a three year old daughter and a husband. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  And she just says that she wanted to have a better life for herself. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=176.0s)]
*  And that's why she's coming here. Take a listen. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=181.4s)]
*  My dreams are many. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=184.68s)]
*  The first is to give a better future for my kids. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=189.44s)]
*  Since getting here, I have the hope and even more faith that I can accomplish everything I want. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=193.88s)]
*  And Jonathan, as you mentioned, the Biden administration is emphasizing that just because Title 42 is over, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=203.0s)]
*  this border is not open and saying that there will be severe consequences for those that do cross illegally. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=208.76s)]
*  NBC's Bree Jackson reporting live from us at the southern border there, El Paso, Texas. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=215.72s)]
*  Thank you so very much. And joining us now, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Julie Serk. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=220.76s)]
*  And Julie, good morning. Yesterday, the House GOP passed a border security package symbolic because it certainly stands no chance of getting through the Senate. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=226.68s)]
*  But tell us what's in the bill and also the political stakes right now for both Republicans and Democrats as Title 42 comes to an end. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=236.16s)]
*  Yeah, this bill is messaging, but Republicans managed to pass something as Title 42 was expiring. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=244.32s)]
*  And that was their goal. And look, they were negotiating up until the final second with members of their own party, two of which ended up voting with Democrats. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=250.8s)]
*  But still, this bill passed. It would fund construction of the Trump era border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=258.8s)]
*  It would also beef up border security presence. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=265.36s)]
*  It would fund additional officers down there to be able to process migrants who are trying to enter unlawfully. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=268.36s)]
*  But Democrats point to the fact that this bill would restrict those who are trying to seek asylum in a lawful manner. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=275.8s)]
*  And you didn't see a single Democrat vote for this bill. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=283.12s)]
*  Speaker McCarthy and his leadership team held a press conference after the fact, touting this as a win. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=285.92s)]
*  Now this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=292.76000000000005s)]
*  Leader Schumer already made it clear he doesn't plan to put this on the floor. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=295.68s)]
*  However, I was in a press conference with Senator Sinema and Senator Tillis yesterday who introduced a bipartisan bill that would give the administration the tools to extend Title 42 without using a public health emergency for two years. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  That bill is not going to go anywhere right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=313.0s)]
*  Certainly, Title 42 already expired. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=315.48s)]
*  But Sinema did tell me in that pen and pad with reporters without cameras that look, the administration had time to fix this problem. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=318.12s)]
*  She's not a fan of what the House Republicans passed, but at least that gives them a starting point, she says, for negotiations. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=325.08s)]
*  Remember, she's also working on a comprehensive border security package with Senator Tom Tillis. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=332.0s)]
*  But right now, really an impasse between Democrats and Republicans on actually getting something done. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=336.64s)]
*  And it's been four decades since Congress passed comprehensive border security measures and immigration reform. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=342.16s)]
*  And we heard from the White House again yesterday calling for that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  But as you say, there's little to no chance of that happening. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=350.88000000000005s)]
*  Biden officials privately acknowledge this is a political vulnerability. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkGirtjQd6o&t=354.0s)]
