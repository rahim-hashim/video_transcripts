# Karine Jean-Pierre: We Heard From Biden At A Time That Is Going To Matter
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ)
*  There's been anger before in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  There's been division before in America. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=3.0s)]
*  But we've never given up on the American experiment. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  We can't do that now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  The remarkable thing about American democracy is this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=13.0s)]
*  Just enough of us, on just enough occasions, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=16.2s)]
*  have chosen not to dismantle democracy, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=21.0s)]
*  but to preserve democracy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=24.0s)]
*  We must choose that path again. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=26.6s)]
*  That was another moment from President Biden's pre-midterm speech last night, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=29.4s)]
*  warning against threats to our nation's democracy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now, White House Press Secretary Corrine Jean-Pierre. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  Corrine, thanks so much for being with us this morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=40.0s)]
*  Let's start... [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=43.0s)]
*  I'm happy to be here, Jonathan. Thanks for having me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=43.8s)]
*  Oh, our pleasure. Thank you. You have an open invitation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=46.0s)]
*  Let's start there with President Biden's speech. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=48.2s)]
*  Tell us why he chose to speak about this hugely important topic, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=52.2s)]
*  threats to democracy, last night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=56.2s)]
*  How much of a role did the attack on Speaker Pelosi's play into the timing? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=58.4s)]
*  And do you think that this was the right moment [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=64.2s)]
*  when polls show that it's the economy that voters care most about? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=67.4s)]
*  Look, the president, as you know, has spoken about this many times, Jonathan. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=73.6s)]
*  You have followed the president for the past couple of years. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=78.0s)]
*  And he has talked about the soul of our nation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=81.4s)]
*  He has talked about protecting our democracy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=84.0s)]
*  He has talked about the importance of strengthening our democracy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=86.4s)]
*  And look, if you look around at what's happening, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=89.2s)]
*  the president last night used his bully pulpit [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  at a time where we are seeing increased political violence, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  where we are seeing voter intimidation, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=98.0s)]
*  and when we are seeing really extreme from the Republican Party, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  from these MAGA Republicans who are saying [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  they are not going to acknowledge the results of the election. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=108.2s)]
*  And the president felt that it was important [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=112.0s)]
*  to just have an honest conversation with the American people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=114.0s)]
*  We cannot pretend that this is not happening. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=117.4s)]
*  It's being done blatantly in front of us. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=119.8s)]
*  And as you said, that clip that you played, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=122.8s)]
*  it's so important that the president laid out, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=125.0s)]
*  we need to pick a path to democracy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=127.0s)]
*  And one thing that the president said last night, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=130.2s)]
*  which is so true, you cannot say that you love your country only when you win. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=132.0s)]
*  We as Americans have to continue to fight for our democracy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=137.8s)]
*  We have to continue to protect and strengthen our democracy, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=142.0s)]
*  as I said at the top. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=145.2s)]
*  And this is, again, this is something that the president has spoken about many, many times. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=146.4s)]
*  We saw the attack on January 6. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=150.6s)]
*  We saw what happened in Charlottesville back in 2017. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=153.0s)]
*  And we are continuing to see that same type of rhetoric [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=157.0s)]
*  that led to the political violence that we saw on Paul Pelosi, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=160.6s)]
*  which was horrific. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=165.0s)]
*  And so, yes, you heard directly from the president at a time [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=166.4s)]
*  that it is going to matter, Jonathan. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=169.6s)]
*  So, Corrine, we just talked about how the Federal Reserve raising interest rates again [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=172.2s)]
*  to try to cool off inflation, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=176.2s)]
*  but that has sparked real fears that the nation could be teetering on the edge of a recession. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=179.0s)]
*  How will the White House prepare for that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=183.6s)]
*  So, I want to be clear. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=188.4s)]
*  There is, we are not, there are no meetings or anything happening like that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=189.6s)]
*  in preparing for a recession because, and I'll say this very clearly, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=193.6s)]
*  and we have said this, our economic team has said this, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=197.8s)]
*  Secretary Yellen has said this, you heard this from the president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Look, what we're seeing right now is a strong labor market. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=203.4s)]
*  And the reason we're seeing the strong labor market is because of the bold actions that this president has taken. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=208.4s)]
*  When you look at the economic, his economic policies, look, we are seeing a unemployment rate at 3.5 percent, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  something that we haven't seen in 50 years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=220.8s)]
*  Again, a strong labor market. All of the things that I just laid out, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=223.8s)]
*  the data points that I just laid out, does not lead to a recession, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=226.8s)]
*  does not define a recession or even define a pre-recession. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  Look, what we're seeing currently is a transition. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=234.4s)]
*  You've heard us talk about this, Jonathan. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=236.8s)]
*  You've been in the briefing room with me. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=238.4s)]
*  You've heard it from Brian Deese. You've heard it from me and from others saying that we are heading into a transition from a stable and steady growth [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=239.8s)]
*  without losing any of the gains that we have made. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=248.0s)]
*  And that's because of the economic policy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=252.4s)]
*  So we want American people, the president want the American people to know that he is doing everything that he can to make sure that we keep those gains. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=254.2s)]
*  But also our number one priority is to lower those costs for the American people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  That's what you have seen the president do with gas prices, taking those bold actions. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=266.2s)]
*  That's why we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  And we're going to continue to see the president work on that every day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=273.2s)]
*  So we are just now five days from the midterms and there are Democrats in a number of states, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=276.8s)]
*  particularly Arizona, who have voiced real concern about so-called poll watchers who are there at ballot places that these voters say are intimidating [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=281.6s)]
*  and perhaps preventing people from wanting to come out to vote. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=290.0s)]
*  Is there anything that the White House and the Department of Justice can do about that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=293.6s)]
*  So I want to be very clear. The president believes, as you heard him say yesterday, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=299.8s)]
*  that he believes that the American people, the vote, the right to vote is the most sacred right, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=305.8s)]
*  It is a sacred right that we need to make sure that we protect. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  The president is going to continue to say that, make his voice very loud and clear. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  You'll see the agencies, Department of Justice and other agencies working together, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=320.0s)]
*  working with local officials to make sure that we protect the right to vote for all Americans. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=324.20000000000005s)]
*  Again, it is a sacred right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=329.8s)]
*  It is something that we need to protect. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=331.6s)]
*  This is something that Democrats, Congressional Democrats and the president focus on in Congress every day because we believe in that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=333.2s)]
*  That's why you heard from the president last night, making sure that these election deniers, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  like calling out election deniers, calling out the political violence, asking for these extreme folks on the other side, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  on these mega Republicans to really take down this rhetoric because it is dangerous. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=353.4s)]
*  And we need to make sure that we're protecting our democracy for all Americans. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=359.0s)]
*  President Biden back on the road later today. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=363.4s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Corinne Jean-Pierre, safe travels and thank you for joining us. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=366.2s)]
*  We will speak to you again soon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyF-ux8mqQ&t=370.0s)]
