# Biden and congressional leaders discuss debt limit Tuesday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM)
*  Speaking of Trump, he weighed in again yesterday on the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump doubled down on his comments from last week encouraging Republicans to default on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=5.18s)]
*  the debt unless they get every spending cut they are demanding. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=9.36s)]
*  Every one of them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=12.9s)]
*  Trump's comments are in contrast to what he said back in 2019 when he was dealing with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=13.96s)]
*  a debt ceiling increase then. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=18.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=19.96s)]
*  Well, hopefully we're in good shape on the debt ceiling. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=20.96s)]
*  I can't imagine anybody ever even thinking of using the debt ceiling as a negotiating [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=24.76s)]
*  wedge. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=29.52s)]
*  And I said, I remember to Senator Schumer and to Nancy Pelosi, would anybody ever use [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  that to negotiate with? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=35.32s)]
*  They said, absolutely not. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=36.64s)]
*  That's a sacred element of our country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=38.08s)]
*  They can't use the debt ceiling to negotiate. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=42.0s)]
*  Now, of course, Trump freely admits that he thinks differently because he's not president. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=44.52s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for the Associated Press, my friend Darlene Superville. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=49.08s)]
*  Darlene, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  So let's talk about the debts and then we can leave Donald Trump out of it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=54.56s)]
*  So there's obviously today high stakes meeting this afternoon. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=58.22s)]
*  The president, congressional leaders, when they met a week or so back, it was pretty [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=61.1s)]
*  contentious. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=65.46s)]
*  Not a lot of progress made. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=66.46s)]
*  It does seem like staffs have at least moved the ball some. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=67.46s)]
*  What are the hopes for today? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=69.62s)]
*  What do we think? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=71.3s)]
*  Your guess is as good as mine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=72.78s)]
*  I think there are at least two ways it can go. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=74.78s)]
*  There can be more signs of progress. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=76.78s)]
*  It might be too early for them to come out and announce a deal because we're still more [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=80.18s)]
*  than a week away from June 1. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=84.5s)]
*  Congressional deadlines, that's what they've got forever. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  They take it right up to the end of the line there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  Or it could also be another meeting where it was like last week where it was kind of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  contentious and Speaker McCarthy came out and said he didn't see any progress made, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  that sort of thing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=101.1s)]
*  So it's a little unclear where it's going to end up this afternoon. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=102.1s)]
*  So my jokes aside, though, that June 1 deadline, yet we know Congress likes to work up right [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  up against it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=109.82s)]
*  But if the fear here is that the markets and other things will react sooner than that, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=110.82s)]
*  so they probably have a little less time than they think. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=115.78s)]
*  The other time pressure here, of course, the president is scheduled to leave tomorrow for [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=117.78s)]
*  an eight-day international trip. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  The itinerary is that Japan first, the G7, and then on for events in Australia and Papua [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=124.38s)]
*  New Guinea meant to shore up America's commitment to the Pacific. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=128.62s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit about this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=132.02s)]
*  First of all, there's some reporting that if the Detson talks really break down, I have [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=133.3s)]
*  this news today that the trip could push back a day or it could shrink. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=136.94s)]
*  The White House seems pretty committed to him going to the G7, which is such an important [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=141.02s)]
*  meeting, particularly at a time of war. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=145.14s)]
*  The Australia part might change. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=147.1s)]
*  What do we think? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=149.5s)]
*  What are the challenges for a president overseas managing a crisis back home? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=150.5s)]
*  Well, one of the challenges is that he is overseas and he's not in D.C., cannot meet [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  with the speaker or anyone else who might he might need to meet with. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=159.22s)]
*  And if they're close enough to an agreement where they need the president to come in and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  seal the deal, he's thousands of miles away in Hiroshima or Australia. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=166.66s)]
*  So that's one of the bigger challenges when the president is abroad at a time like this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=171.38s)]
*  They like this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=175.14s)]
*  The White House loves to say, every White House, not just this one, loves to say, well, you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=176.14s)]
*  can be president anywhere, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=178.18s)]
*  Because you're whether you're on Air Force One or anything else. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=179.9s)]
*  But like to your point, especially if things are close, you don't have that face to face [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=182.46s)]
*  to seal the deal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=187.7s)]
*  You don't have the face to face to seal the deal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=188.7s)]
*  And the president is one of those people who does like that face to face interaction and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=190.1s)]
*  being in the room with people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=194.3s)]
*  So it'll be a challenge. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=195.3s)]
*  It'll be a challenge. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=196.3s)]
*  We'll have to see if the itinerary changes or even if the trip is postponed somewhat. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=197.3s)]
*  Push back a little bit. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  We will be staying on this White House reporter for the Associated Press, Darlene Superville. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you as always. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=205.14s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=206.14s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um53Jcn3MHM&t=207.14s)]
