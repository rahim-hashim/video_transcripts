# Republican recruits hesitate to jump in if Trump is the nominee
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8)
*  Although next year's presidential election is already generating a lot of headlines, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=0.0s)]
*  there is new reporting about the effect that Trump's 2024 campaign is having on potential [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=5.44s)]
*  down-ballot candidates. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=10.56s)]
*  In a new piece, the good folks at Politico write that the former president's early dominance [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  in primary polling is spooking some Republicans who are considering runs for the House and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=17.14s)]
*  Senate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=23.72s)]
*  According to a dozen recruiters, political operatives, and congressional hopefuls who [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=24.72s)]
*  spoke with Politico, many prospective recruits are wary of running alongside Trump, who dominates [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=28.68s)]
*  the spotlight, repels crucial independent voters, and forces his fellow Republicans [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=35.12s)]
*  to answer for his unpredictable statements. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=41.0s)]
*  And joining us now, one of the reporters who bylined that story, Politico's Holly Otterbein. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=44.6s)]
*  Holly, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=49.36s)]
*  So let's explore this topic, a really smart take here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=51.44s)]
*  What's the concern level among Republican leadership that candidates who would see as [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=55.08s)]
*  strong candidates to help for the retake the Senate, build their lead in the House, are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  going to get spooked and scared off because of Trump? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  We saw what Trump did last time, put his people fourth in 2022, and got a lot of losses to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  show for it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=74.88s)]
*  I mean, it's something that recruiters for the Republicans are really running into. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=75.88s)]
*  Few Republican candidates relish having to answer for every single comment that Trump [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=82.04s)]
*  makes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  And of course, he lost the election in 2020. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  And so many are concerned that he could drag them down. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=92.08s)]
*  In the end, Republicans think that this probably won't have too much of an effect on their [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=95.64s)]
*  ability to flip the Senate and hold on to their majority in the House. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=100.92s)]
*  They think many of these candidates will ultimately run. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  But it is a hiccup that they're running into. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=108.4s)]
*  Take for instance, David McCormick in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  National Republicans like Mitch McConnell really want him to run for the Senate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  He's wealthy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  They think he's got a great resume. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=121.4s)]
*  They think he could appeal to suburban voters. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=122.92s)]
*  But the prospect of running alongside Trump is one of the things that McCormick and his [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  team are weighing as he decides whether or not to run. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what two Republicans close to him told us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=134.76s)]
*  So we know that's one of the biggest targets on the Senate map for Republicans is Pennsylvania. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=138.0s)]
*  And so that's just one example. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  We talked to many other congressional candidates and other recruiters in other states and congressional [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=147.78s)]
*  districts who are running into this similar problem. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=156.0s)]
*  And so I think it's causing a hiccup right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=159.5s)]
*  It's not a full blown disaster yet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=162.02s)]
*  It's early. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  But it is causing an issue for them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6PQaKheAu8&t=165.38s)]
