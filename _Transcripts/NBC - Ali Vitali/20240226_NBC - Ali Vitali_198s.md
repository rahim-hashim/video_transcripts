# RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to resign next week
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ)
*  Welcome back and we've got a bit of breaking news this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Just learned, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel will be resigning her post next month, March [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=4.4s)]
*  8th. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=9.8s)]
*  McDaniel has led the committee since 2017, having recently been re-elected to the post [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=10.8s)]
*  just last year. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=15.64s)]
*  The RNC has not yet announced an interim chair, but former President Trump has publicly backed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=17.44s)]
*  the chairman of North Carolina's Republican Party, a man named Michael Watley, to replace [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=23.02s)]
*  McDaniel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=28.32s)]
*  In a statement, McDaniel says this, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=29.64s)]
*  Elsewhere in the Republican politics, in a big financial blow to Nikki Haley's bid for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=46.64s)]
*  the GOP nomination, conservative billionaire Charles Koch and the Super PAC Americans for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=50.68s)]
*  Prosperity Action are now suspending funding to the former South Carolina governor's campaign [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=56.12s)]
*  following her 20-point loss to Donald Trump in her home state over the weekend. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=63.32s)]
*  Although Americans for Prosperity Action has poured $31 million into Haley's campaign's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=68.16s)]
*  coffers, the PAC CEO said in an email to staffers that the Koch-backed group no longer believed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=73.4s)]
*  it could make a material difference to widen Haley's path to victory. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=79.36s)]
*  Joining us now, communication strategist and former aide to House Speakers Ryan and Boehner, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  Brendan Buck. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=88.96s)]
*  He is an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=89.96s)]
*  Brendan, let's just start with this breaking news about Ronna McDaniel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  It seemed like her fate was sealed as soon as Trump a few weeks ago said that he wanted [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=95.8s)]
*  leadership change ahead of the RNC, including putting his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, into [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=99.32s)]
*  a prominent position. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=103.56s)]
*  Tell us about what you think McDaniel's legacy is, but also what this change will mean for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=105.28s)]
*  the RNC going forward. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, in her statement, she's not wrong that it's somewhat normal for a new nominee to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  come in and put their people in place. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=119.8s)]
*  I think what's interesting here is she was his person to begin with. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=121.28s)]
*  And this is clearly the president trying to stack the RNC, but I think it just shows you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=125.32s)]
*  that she was hardly the person who was really anti-Trump to begin with or standing up to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=129.92s)]
*  him to begin with. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=134.28s)]
*  But we should imagine that if Donald Trump becomes president again, the entire Republican [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=136.36s)]
*  ecosystem is going to be built up in his image. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=140.44s)]
*  And that's what's happening here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, he's talked about his daughter-in-law. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=145.72s)]
*  So it's an RNC thing, but I think it's something that we should think about extending far [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  beyond that into the administration, into Congress. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=152.88s)]
*  This is going to be the most Trumpy Republican Party you've ever seen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=155.68s)]
*  And of course, the RNC needs to be a big part of that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=159.36s)]
*  She has had some ups and downs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=162.8s)]
*  I think she always struggled figuring out whether or not she was a natural Trump person [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=165.6s)]
*  in this role. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=171.2s)]
*  But I think she's probably, more than anything, quite glad to have this part of her life behind her. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcbLNAvYIyQ&t=173.28s)]
