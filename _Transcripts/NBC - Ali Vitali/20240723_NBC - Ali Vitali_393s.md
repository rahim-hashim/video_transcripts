*  And we did everybody good on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=76.04s)]
*  It's mutual. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=78.04s)]
*  I knew you were still there. You're not going anywhere Joe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=80.04s)]

*  President Biden is expected to make a public on-camera address of some sort [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=94.04s)]
*  about his decision to drop out of the race at some point this week he is slated [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=98.04s)]
*  to return to the White House later today. Joining us now best-selling [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=102.04s)]
*  author and NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss. Michael a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=106.04s)]
*  pleasure to see you this morning. Same, Jonathan. You've had now a couple of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=110.04s)]
*  days to think on this from President Biden's decision on Sunday to not seek [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=114.04s)]
*  reelection to step aside to endorse his vice president. Tell us now as to where [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=120.04s)]
*  you think this will be remembered in history. Well I think this could be the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=124.04s)]
*  moment that this presidential race has been transformed. History may have been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=129.04s)]
*  changed and the system worked. You know in 1988 for instance before the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=134.04s)]
*  Republican convention George H.W. Bush was running maybe 17 points behind [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=139.04s)]
*  Michael Dukakis. He had a great convention. Things somersaulted. Same [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=145.04s)]
*  thing in 1992. Bill Clinton was at some at one point running a third behind [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=150.04s)]
*  Ross Perot and George H.W. Bush had a great convention and suddenly he was in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=156.04s)]
*  the lead by 17 or 18 points by some polls. What we've seen in the last couple [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=161.04s)]
*  of days is an effort by leaders in the Democratic Party and rank and file to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=167.04s)]
*  say we love Joe Biden. We honor his record but we don't think he's going to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=173.04s)]
*  be the strongest presidential candidate for him this year. Joe Biden listened. A [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=177.04s)]
*  change was made and now as I say this is a very different race. That's what [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=183.04s)]
*  happens in a democracy. If you have a party that behaves like a dictatorship [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=188.04s)]
*  the candidate stays on and on whether he or she is the best or not. Yeah let's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=192.04s)]
*  speak about what is so uniquely American the idea of transferring power. In this [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=198.04s)]
*  case President Biden handing off to his running mate and of course we saw that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=202.04s)]
*  that very concept threatened endangered on January 6. Give us your thoughts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=207.04s)]
*  Well it was almost poetic because you know this presidency began the Biden [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=214.04s)]
*  presidency just as you're saying Jonathan. January of 2021 when Donald Trump [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=219.04s)]
*  tried to steal a second term as president violate the law wage an [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=225.04s)]
*  insurrection against the Constitution and the Congress that might have even led to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=230.04s)]
*  assassination. There were certainly signs of that and Joe Biden was the one [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=234.04s)]
*  who came in and consistently through this president he said presidency he has [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=239.04s)]
*  said my great mission is to preserve democracy and let it flourish. We even [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=244.04s)]
*  heard that in that bite from that telephone call that you played a couple [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=249.04s)]
*  of minutes ago and so as this presidency ends within his party he consulted his [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=253.04s)]
*  leaders. He said all right I'm sure he doesn't want to lead presidents and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=259.04s)]
*  political leaders never want to give up power but he did. He put the country [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=264.04s)]
*  before himself and the result is that there is now a standard-bearer Kamala [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=268.04s)]
*  Harris with great energy you know prosecutor has been in state office [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=273.04s)]
*  elected attorney general elected vice president or in policy experience who's [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=279.04s)]
*  equipped to take the case to Trump and I heard you say it a little bit earlier [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=284.04s)]
*  this hour the Democrats would be probably justified if they pick up that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=288.04s)]
*  slogan that you mentioned the cop versus the con. Yeah so let's get your [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=293.04s)]
*  assessment here actually on the vice president your thoughts on her [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=297.04s)]
*  evolution in office and what her candidacy looks like in terms of taking [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=300.04s)]
*  on Trump but also what it may mean to people. Well vice presidents usually have [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=306.04s)]
*  an extremely hard time I was just mentioning George H.W. Bush who we [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=312.04s)]
*  historians think of as a very substantial president did a lot to end [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=316.04s)]
*  the Cold War in a way that we never could have imagined but when he was [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=321.04s)]
*  Reagan's vice president he was there in his vice presidential role. Jimmy Carter [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=325.04s)]
*  always said he thought that as vice president George H.W. Bush looked sort of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=330.04s)]
*  goofy because he was so determined not to outshine the boss. That is true of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=335.04s)]
*  almost every vice president who serves and so when you see a vice president [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=340.04s)]
*  running for office it's an entirely new role so we're going to be discovering [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=345.04s)]
*  what I consider to be Kamala Harris's formidable leadership qualities in some [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=350.04s)]
*  cases voters will for the first time they're going to learn about them very [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=356.04s)]
*  soon. And of course were she to win her election would be certainly historic. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=360.04s)]
*  Best selling author and NBC News presidential historian Michael Bachelos. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=365.04s)]
*  Michael thank you we'll talk to you again soon. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=369.04s)]
*  you [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3KGErLY8YI&t=375.04s)]
