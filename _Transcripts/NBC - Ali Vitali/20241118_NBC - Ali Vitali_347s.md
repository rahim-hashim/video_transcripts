# DOJ and FBI staffers contact lawyers as Trump prosecutions loom
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU)
*  Multiple current and former Justice Department and FBI officials have reportedly started [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=0.0s)]
*  reaching out to lawyers in anticipation of being criminally investigated by the incoming [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=10.76s)]
*  Three people with knowledge of the deliberations tell NBC News that many DOJ staffers were [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=12.68s)]
*  already nervous about the possibility they would be targeted by Trump loyalists, and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=17.76s)]
*  the selection of former Congressmen Matt Gaetz to lead the Department of Justice has only [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=22.96s)]
*  increased their sense of alarm. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=28.62s)]
*  Joining us now, author, columnist, and conservative writer, Matt Lewis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=30.62s)]
*  Matt, we're glad you could join us this morning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  So let's talk about this right now, this idea, this chilling effect that so many in, well, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=37.1s)]
*  across the federal bureaucracy, but particularly those attached to the DOJ feel with Trump [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=43.22s)]
*  coming in and trying to populate those agencies with his people. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=48.74s)]
*  How real, how worried should they be? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=53.3s)]
*  I think it's real. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=56.94s)]
*  This is something that this is really Donald Trump's campaign theme was retribution. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=58.3s)]
*  He's been talking about this for years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=63.54s)]
*  He personally feels like he was the victim of a political witch hunt. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=65.94s)]
*  Now we can put aside the evidence and the actual details. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=70.38s)]
*  That's I think that Donald Trump truly believes that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=73.94s)]
*  And if you look at the early selections he's made, including Matt Gaetz as attorney general, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=78.1s)]
*  it looks like he is putting people in place who would implement this campaign of retribution. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=83.62s)]
*  So this is obviously a very un-American thing to do. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=89.42s)]
*  I don't want to become too freaked out with the Trump derangement syndrome, but it's hard [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  to imagine what he would be doing differently if he did not intend to kind of weaponize [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=101.1s)]
*  the Department of Justice. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=105.74s)]
*  Yeah, Matt, I think that's exactly right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=107.06s)]
*  I mean, we've heard from so many who say, oh, you know, it's fine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=109.22s)]
*  He just he just says things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=112.7s)]
*  He doesn't mean it like it won't be so different. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  The democracy will be fine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=117.3s)]
*  But we don't know that because we have learned to largely take him at his word. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=118.82s)]
*  And these are exactly the threats he made. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=124.62s)]
*  And he seems to be staffing up in order to carry them out. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=127.38s)]
*  You did write, though, that there are some silver linings here for some conservatives. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=131.22s)]
*  Tell us what you meant by that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=135.5s)]
*  Well, first, I wrote that before some of these selections, such as Matt Gaetz. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=137.73999999999998s)]
*  But I do think it's important to try to keep perspective. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=143.38s)]
*  So I wrote a column for The Hill saying what could be the silver linings? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=146.78s)]
*  What good could come from a Trump administration? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=151.42s)]
*  And if you're a progressive, there may not be any good. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  It may be bad all the way down. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  As a conservative, as someone who is sort of in the Reaganite tradition, I think there [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  could be some good things. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=165.26s)]
*  The early selections of Marco Rubio for secretary of state, I think Susie Wiles, as chief of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=166.34s)]
*  staff, suggests it's going to be more certainly less chaotic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=172.22s)]
*  And I think that certainly Donald Trump will be a staunch ally of Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  I think we could actually do something to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=181.46s)]
*  Donald Trump clearly cares about the economy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=186.26000000000002s)]
*  Now, I think some of his policies, the tariffs could be inflationary and undermine that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=188.66000000000003s)]
*  He certainly wants to do something on the economy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=194.34s)]
*  You were talking earlier about Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=197.74s)]
*  Perhaps there's a way that we can wind this down in a manner that doesn't appease Putin [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  and have him coming back later for more. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=205.78s)]
*  So I think there is some possibilities for silver linings, even though I should say I'm [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  also more probably more worried than I am optimistic. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=214.18s)]
*  I think that's a reasonable approach. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=217.94s)]
*  So, Matt, let's take Trump at his word that he wants these people in his cabinet. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=221.38s)]
*  And if needed, he'll use to try to force them through through recess appointments, like [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=227.46s)]
*  try a real test of the Senate, trying to break the Senate. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=231.38s)]
*  How do you see that playing out? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=235.1s)]
*  There's an institutionalist now in John Thune heading the upper chamber, but there's also [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  not been a lot of precedent for Republicans standing up to Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=241.02s)]
*  Totally right there. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=247.54s)]
*  If you're betting on Republicans standing up and being strong, you're losing money over [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=249.02s)]
*  the course of the last certainly nine years. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=253.58s)]
*  He has basically rolled over them and tamed them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, I do think it's important for the Senate to kind of exercise its independence and the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=260.42s)]
*  advice and consent that they have. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=266.3s)]
*  And they very well may do that when it comes to Matt Gaetz. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=269.82s)]
*  I think the problem is at the end of the day, Donald Trump is going to get somebody that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=272.42s)]
*  he wants in these key positions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  And it may be that that person's even worse, actually, than Matt Gaetz. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=279.22s)]
*  If the Republican Senate can deny him Matt Gaetz, I don't know how many people, how many [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=283.58000000000004s)]
*  times they can get away with that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=289.74s)]
*  And so at the end of the day, you know, the die was cast back the first Tuesday of November. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=291.54s)]
*  Donald Trump will get the cabinet he wants and maybe have just different names than we [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=298.3s)]
*  think right now. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=302.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=303.82s)]
*  I think that's a fair assessment. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=304.82s)]
*  And the pace of these picks have just been relentless. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=305.82s)]
*  Some big ones do remain, though, certainly while waiting for the head of the FBI, as [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=309.7s)]
*  well as Secretary of the Treasury. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=313.94s)]
*  There's been reporting there that some real disagreements in his camp about that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=316.02s)]
*  We of course will stay on it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=319.42s)]
*  Author, columnist and conservative writer Matt Lewis. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=321.62s)]
*  Matt, thank you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=324.5s)]
*  We really appreciate you being with us this morning. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-SF8YH7rU&t=325.5s)]
