# 'Replacing Biden would be a mistake for our country': Congressman warns
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI)
*  President Joe Biden is facing a growing number of calls to abandon his reelection bid following last week's debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=0.0s)]
*  In the critical battleground state of Georgia, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's editorial board argues that it's time for Biden to pass the torch. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=7.0s)]
*  The New York Times' editorial board said Biden should drop out, calling his candidacy a reckless gamble. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=15.0s)]
*  And New York Times' opinion columnist Maureen Dowd argues, quote, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=24.0s)]
*  The Washington Post's David Ignatius puts it this way, writing, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=39.0s)]
*  Biden has the strength and wisdom to step aside. The Democrats will have two months to choose another candidate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=43.0s)]
*  Even longtime Democratic strategist James Carville told Axios he thinks Biden will be off the ticket by election day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=49.0s)]
*  The Biden campaign blasts out a fundraising note from Carville just over the weekend. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=56.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Wiley Nicholl of North Carolina. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=61.0s)]
*  He is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and the Problem Solvers Caucus. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=65.0s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We really appreciate it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=70.0s)]
*  Let me just ask you, do you believe that President Biden should continue his reelection campaign? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, the reason I really want to be on this interview, way too early does a great job setting the tone for the rest of the day. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=79.0s)]
*  And I think folks need to hear this. There's only one candidate for President of the United States who should step down, and it's the convicted felon. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=87.0s)]
*  I think replacing Joe Biden would be a mistake for our country, and it's simply not going to happen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=94.0s)]
*  So let's talk then, as noted, a lot of opinions, pages are suggesting the president should step down. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=100.0s)]
*  There are a lot of Democrats privately saying the same, though, to be clear, that not really much in the way of public calls for that yet. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=107.0s)]
*  But the perception is out there that the president is sort of weakened. So what advice would you give to him? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=115.0s)]
*  What should he be doing in the days ahead to reassure fellow Democrats that he is up for this? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=121.0s)]
*  Well, you know, he did it right here in my home state of North Carolina. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=126.0s)]
*  He came to just outside of my district in Raleigh right after the debate, gave a great speech. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=130.0s)]
*  I think we're going to see a lot more of that. I think and I think these are very fair questions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=137.0s)]
*  I think this is an important discussion to have. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=141.0s)]
*  I wish we were talking more about all of Donald Trump's lies at the debate, but he's going to get out there in front of the press. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=145.0s)]
*  He's going to he's going to get out there in front of the public and they're going to get to judge for themselves. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=151.0s)]
*  But I believe this was just a bad night, a candidate who was was way overprepared. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=156.0s)]
*  I think I think there's some questions about how he was prepared for the debate. He was trying to get so much in in these questions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=164.0s)]
*  And in fairness, it's hard to keep up with Donald Trump when he just continues to go all over the place with crazy stuff. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah. And let's be clear, the president, by his own admission, said he had a he had a tough night. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=177.0s)]
*  So let me ask you this. What are you hearing from your fellow Democrats behind the scenes? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=181.0s)]
*  Are you are you hearing someone ease or or members of your party still with him? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=185.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was it was not a great performance by President Biden. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=190.0s)]
*  You know, I think that's clear, but the policies are great. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=195.0s)]
*  And and I think the place that the folks I serve with in Congress are is pretty simple. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=198.0s)]
*  You know, we we need to continue to talk about the good work that the Biden administration has done and go out there and make the case. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=204.0s)]
*  We're going to have to carry Joe Biden to victory just the same way we carried Barack Obama to victory and and President Biden to victory in the last election. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=211.0s)]
*  But for folks watching, it's on us to make that case with our friends, our neighbors, that this is a president we need to keep because we can never let Donald Trump get back to the Oval Office again. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=219.0s)]
*  So let's talk about that race ahead. The president, we take him at his word. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=231.0s)]
*  He stays in. What sort of contrasts in particular do you think he needs to draw with Trump that will resonate in your state, a battleground state which the Democrats certainly think they could potentially put in play? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=235.0s)]
*  No, you know, we need to we need to make the case about protecting the right to vote, protecting the right to choose. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=248.0s)]
*  That's those are the issues that matter in North Carolina. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=254.0s)]
*  And doing the good bipartisan work, there's only one candidate for president who's going to work across the aisle in a bipartisan way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=257.0s)]
*  Joe Biden has demonstrated that I'm going to be with Secretary Pete Buttigieg just in a few hours making some great announcements about federal funding coming to North Carolina because of that bipartisan. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=264.0s)]
*  Infrastructure deal that that passed under Joe Biden's leadership. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=277.0s)]
*  So, you know, the Biden campaign is doing everything they need to do in North Carolina. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=280.0s)]
*  They're here a ton. They're making those investments because North Carolina is a state that will determine the president of the United States. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=284.0s)]
*  I believe we're going to be the state that decides Joe Biden only lost by a point and a half in the last election. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=291.0s)]
*  So it's incredibly close. And I think we're a point and a half more to the to the center since then. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=298.0s)]
*  All right. Democratic Congressman Wiley Nicoll of North Carolina. Thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=304.0s)]
*  We really appreciate you being on this morning. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKVn7_B9rFI&t=307.0s)]
