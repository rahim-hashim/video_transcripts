# GOP senator says 'huge mistake' to use military for mass deportations
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM)
*  Welcome back. One of Donald Trump's longtime allies is publicly speaking out against the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=0.0s)]
*  president-elect's plan to use the military as part of a mass deportation operation targeting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=6.44s)]
*  undocumented immigrants. Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky expressed his opposition [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=12.08s)]
*  to the plan yesterday in an interview he gave on a cable show. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=17.56s)]
*  I'm not in favor of sending the army in uniforms into our cities to collect people. I think [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=22.96s)]
*  it's a terrible image and that's not what we use our military for. We never have and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=28.8s)]
*  it's actually been illegal for over a hundred years to bring the army into our city. So [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=33.72s)]
*  while I'm all for remain in Mexico, I will not support an emergency to put the army into [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  our cities. I think that's a huge mistake. Joining us now, former U.S. Secretary of Housing [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=44.52s)]
*  and Urban Development, Julian Castro. He is an MSNBC political analyst. Mr. Secretary, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=50.44s)]
*  thank you for being with us this morning. You've certainly been an outspoken critic [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=55.32s)]
*  of Trump's mass deportation plan. Let's zero in on that angle of it. The idea of, first [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=57.76s)]
*  of all, a Republican speaking out against, but secondly, that image of using the American [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=63.8s)]
*  military to do this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=68.24s)]
*  Well, a couple of things here. I think this is just a preview of some of the problems [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=69.72s)]
*  that Trump is going to have if he actually tries to go through with his mass deportation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=73.92s)]
*  plan. Rand Paul makes a very good point. This is not what we use the military for and I [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=78.72s)]
*  wouldn't be surprised if there are other Republicans who agree with him there. Secondly, I think [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=82.92s)]
*  this issue of mass deportation, as much as it was polled before the election and you [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=87.76s)]
*  had some support among the public, the difference between that in theory and Americans actually [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=92.16s)]
*  seeing that in living color on their TV, on streaming, in every way that we get our visual [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=98.68s)]
*  images these days, I think that public opinion would very quickly go against this kind of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  plan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=109.52s)]
*  Well, that's the idea. I've heard so many Democrats say exactly that, this idea that's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=110.52s)]
*  pulling your neighbors out of their homes, children out of school, that that will look [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=114.4s)]
*  very different than just sort of a vague promise on the campaign trail. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's easy for people when they're answering a polling question, if you just [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=122.76s)]
*  ask them impromptu, should everybody get deported who's not here legally in the country, but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  when you see the effect of that and people realize that it's not just somebody that came [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=132.96s)]
*  across yesterday that's seeking asylum, it's somebody that has been doing their yard work [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=138.0s)]
*  or goes to the same church or their kids go to the same school, it's much more deep and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  personal than that and I think folks are going to recognize that if Trump actually tries [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=149.52s)]
*  this and I think that it's going to be dead on arrival that he tries it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=153.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there's certainly very personal reasons as you just said, but there are also [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  economic reasons. I know you voiced some concerns. How would you see were he to carry out this [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=159.04s)]
*  plan? What does that do the nation's economy? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=163.8s)]
*  I mean this would decimate the American economy. There are a number of industries that are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=165.84s)]
*  absolutely reliant on undocumented immigrants, whether people like that or not. Those are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=170.08s)]
*  just the facts. Whether you're talking about the construction industry, the agricultural [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  industry, meatpacking, any number of other industries. Hospitality is another one and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=177.96s)]
*  so as Americans, I don't think that we fully grappled with the reality of what undocumented [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=182.96s)]
*  immigrants mean to the United States, what they produce for our economy, how reliant [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  we are and again people can like that or not like that, but those are the facts and Donald [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=192.68s)]
*  Trump coming in try and do mass deportation would not only be I think personally humanly [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  cruel but also would decimate the American economy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  And there's certainly a theory out there that some business leaders might warn Trump that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=206.32s)]
*  that could happen. We know how much Trump cares about their approval and potentially [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=211.32s)]
*  the stock market, but setting that aside, were he to continue to forge forward with [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=214.68s)]
*  this plan, what do you see if anything that Democratic or Republican, whether it's mayors [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=219.08s)]
*  or governors, local officials, is there anything that can be done to sort of stand in the way? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's gonna be a lot of pushback and look, there's a blueprint for that pushback [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=229.16s)]
*  that we saw during the first Trump administration and that we've seen before. For instance, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=232.8s)]
*  in years before, police chiefs across the United States have objected to local police [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=237.24s)]
*  being turned into immigration agents because they say, hey, this would actually make us [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  less safe. People are less willing to report crime, less willing to interact with public [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=246.8s)]
*  safety officials because they fear that they might get entangled in a deportation scheme [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=251.3s)]
*  and that means everybody is less safe. So I think there, obviously, legal protection, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=255.54s)]
*  the ACLU has already filed a lawsuit against the federal government seeking more information [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=260.38s)]
*  about how this would be done. You're gonna see a lot of pushback to this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=264.38s)]
*  So let's turn to some of the other matters right now during the presidential transition. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=268.06s)]
*  And you just, as you sat down, you raised I think something important that we've talked [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=271.82s)]
*  a little bit about on the show, this idea of the vetting process and the lack of FBI [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=275.42s)]
*  background checks. That's right. Trump, you know, seems to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=280.06s)]
*  want to go around the usual process and instead of using the FBI for background checks, use [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=283.22s)]
*  some private service or who knows, maybe not even do any background checks in the first [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=287.98s)]
*  place. There's a question as to whether he can do that. But one of the reasons that I [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=291.54s)]
*  think he may be trying to do that is to avoid his nominees getting into problems with the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=294.86s)]
*  law by lying to the FBI. We have seen a number of instances of that in his administration, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=300.94s)]
*  past administrations. So this may be one way with all of the baggage that we know that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  these several of these nominees have of trying to avoid criminal charges coming down the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=312.62s)]
*  pike later. That hasn't been mentioned much, but that's a real concern for those folks [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=317.74s)]
*  that he's put up and that may have issues where they would be tempted to lie to the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=321.94s)]
*  FBI and you're on the hook criminally in a way that you're not if you're talking to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  some private agency that, you know, doesn't have the same authority. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=330.06s)]
*  Great point. It also seems like the vetting process they've used, as we've seen for some [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=335.62s)]
*  of these nominees, has already missed some pretty damaging material. We really appreciate [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=338.86s)]
*  former Secretary Lulia Ancestra for joining us this morning. We hope you'll come back [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=342.82s)]
*  soon. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=346.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlWcdRxVM&t=364.86s)]
