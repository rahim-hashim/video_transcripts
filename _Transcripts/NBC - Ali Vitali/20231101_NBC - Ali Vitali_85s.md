# Trump sues to ensure ballot access in Michigan
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE)
*  Welcome back. Former President Trump is suing Michigan's top election official to ensure that he'll be on the ballot next year. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes as legal challenges were filed in that state that could keep Trump off the ballot based on his actions on January 6th, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=7.0s)]
*  according to Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=15.44s)]
*  The amendment states in part that no person shall hold any office who has engaged in insurrection or rebellion. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=18.92s)]
*  After having taken an oath to support the Constitution, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=24.84s)]
*  lawyers for Trump argue that Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has created uncertainty over whether or not Trump will actually be on the ballot [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  after she didn't respond to a letter asking if he will be on the list of candidates for the primary or general election. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=35.72s)]
*  Michigan's Secretary of State has previously declined that she's to say that she has the authority to keep Trump off the ballot. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=43.84s)]
*  A spokesperson for Benson responded to the New York Times yesterday saying her office does not comment on pending litigation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  We're seeing a similar effort in Colorado, other states also considering it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=56.76s)]
*  Not quite clear the legality, and it's certainly politically risky. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=60.72s)]
*  Joining us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN811Xi_wzE&t=64.75999999999999s)]
