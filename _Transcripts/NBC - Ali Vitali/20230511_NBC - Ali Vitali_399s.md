# U.S. border in crisis as Title 42 set to expire Thursday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I)
*  Welcome back. With the Title 42 border restriction set to end tonight, officials say that as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=0.0s)]
*  many as 65,000 migrants are weighing to cross from northern Mexico. This, as NBC News learns [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=6.7s)]
*  of a new policy the Biden administration is planning to roll out. NBC News senior national [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=14.82s)]
*  correspondent Tom Yamaas has more. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=20.64s)]
*  Long lines of migrants turning themselves in as time is running out on Title 42 border [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=24.7s)]
*  officials urging those who crossed illegally to line up and get processed or face the consequences. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  How much confusion is there out there with Title 42 being lifted and the new Biden policy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=36.94s)]
*  being enacted? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  They don't know who to believe. They don't know who to listen to. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  It's why some families insist on living outside the Sacred Heart Church in El Paso. This family [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  is from Guatemala traveling with their three month old. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=51.04s)]
*  They tell me they believe being processed means being deported. They've risked too much [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=54.28s)]
*  to get here to be sent back. The number of migrants now breaking records even before [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Title 42 expires. More than 11,000 illegal border crossings in just 24 hours. CBP processing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  centers over capacity. All after this message from President Biden. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=75.48s)]
*  It is going to be chaotic for a while. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=80.36s)]
*  The confusion has brought many migrants right here to an unofficial access point on the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=82.76s)]
*  Juarez El Paso border. Men, women and children are waiting in 90 degree heat with no shade [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=87.2s)]
*  hoping that they'll be allowed in to get processed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=93.92s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas with this blunt warning to migrants. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=96.44s)]
*  Do not listen to the lies of the smugglers. This is what will happen to you. You will [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  be returned. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=107.44s)]
*  But NBC News now learning the Biden administration is set to make a major change, preparing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=108.84s)]
*  to direct border patrol agents to release migrants into the U.S. without an immigration [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  court date and with no way to keep tabs on them, according to three sources familiar [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=118.7s)]
*  with the plans. Mayorkas insist it's a fraction of the migrants who are being released and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=123.58s)]
*  they're vetted. Republican lawmakers blasting President Biden. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=128.74s)]
*  The Biden administration has failed the American people. He has failed our border patrol agents. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=132.62s)]
*  He has failed our border communities and he has failed America with his open border policy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=140.88s)]
*  Our thanks to Tom Yamas for that report and joining us now is the founding president of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=148.32s)]
*  Volto Latino and an MSNBC contributor, Maria Teresa Kumar. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  Maria, great to see you this morning. This is obviously in many ways is a humanitarian [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=156.46s)]
*  story and a crisis, but of course, it's also a political one. Give us your sense as to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=160.24s)]
*  what the images we're going to see from the border these next few days, weeks, months. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=166.28s)]
*  How do you think that will impact this presidency? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  I think it's going to be a humanitarian crisis because the administration sadly had three [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=174.9s)]
*  years to address it and because of what they inherited on the Trump and through the Trump [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=180.22s)]
*  administration, they just couldn't fix the system fast enough. I do think that it's going to be an [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=185.5s)]
*  opportunity though for the president to communicate the root causes of why individuals are at the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=190.56s)]
*  border. Right now, we often talk about this dis-civilization of Ukraine and what would happen to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=195.62s)]
*  democracy worldwide. We're not talking about right now what's happening in Latin America. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=200.86s)]
*  We are seeing democracies that have been longstanding really threatened and as a result, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=206.26s)]
*  they are getting mass investments from both Russia and China and they are destabilizing a region that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=211.46s)]
*  we're seeing the impact at the border. We're also seeing it because of massive climate change. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=217.06s)]
*  And so unless the president can communicate what is happening at the border and come up with a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=221.34s)]
*  system that allows for safe migration, it's going to be very difficult. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=225.74s)]
*  One of the things that I know from folks that are living in El Paso is that the amount of migrants has [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=230.22s)]
*  not only not stemmed, but they don't have enough resources to process them fast enough. So we are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=236.78s)]
*  hoping that not only can the media have conversations, I think Tom, the package that you had with [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=242.46s)]
*  Yalmas was dead on, having conversations with the people who are impacted, both American citizens [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=247.3s)]
*  and the people that are fleeing, but also having sympathy and understanding that what's going to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=252.94s)]
*  happen is going to be quite complex. I think politically, the president has, if he doesn't communicate [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=256.9s)]
*  what's happening, the Republicans are going to shape it as criminals invading. We saw that, got a little taste of that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=261.42s)]
*  yesterday from Trump's town hall and that's where all of a sudden everybody in the Latino community [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  becomes a target and we become all collectively very vulnerable because people cannot decide or decipher [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=273.06s)]
*  who is undocumented based on the color of their skin or someone's accent. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=279.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great and disturbing point you make there. So you mentioned Tom's package, we just watched it together. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=282.66s)]
*  He went through some of the additional measures the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security have laid out here [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=289.02s)]
*  in an attempt to try to facilitate things a little better at the border. What's your reaction? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=294.02s)]
*  Did anything stick out to you as something that might have some success? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, one of the things that the president is doing that is basically Obama era policies that Trump [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=300.9s)]
*  immediately took out was where people can go to their home countries and process, get processed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=307.06s)]
*  If people, for example, in Colombia have a loved one that's here, they can get processed. If they're in Nicaragua, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  if they're Honduras, they can get processed and that is going to be a game changer for many so that they are not [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=319.06s)]
*  vulnerable to human traffickers. They also have an app that allows you to file for asylum before you get to the border. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=323.97999999999996s)]
*  That's helpful. It has had significant glitches. Hopefully that will get resolved. But I do think that when we talk about [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  the vulnerability of human trafficking, sometimes we think that it's just on one side of the border. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=338.14s)]
*  We have to recognize that there's a complicit sleet oftentimes by U.S. corporations and companies who are asking [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=343.34s)]
*  these human traffickers to go find the certain kind of labor that they have because we do have a massive labor shortage. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=349.94s)]
*  So as we have these conversations, we have to recognize that our country depends very much on many of these migrants. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  So how do we actually process them in an ethical way, in a humanitarian way, but in a way that is also allowing us to be safe at our borders? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  A really important conversation and one we'd love to continue in the days ahead with you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=371.18s)]
*  Maria, Teresa Kumar, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKf2O9mo22I&t=375.18s)]
