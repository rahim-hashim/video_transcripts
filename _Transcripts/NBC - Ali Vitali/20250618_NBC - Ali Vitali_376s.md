# Senate Republicans emerge divided from megabill briefing
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA)
*  New analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates Republicans' so-called Big [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=0.0s)]
*  Beautiful bill would increase the debt by about $3.4 trillion over the next decade. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  The new dynamic scoring data is another blow to President Trump's signature legislation, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  which passed the House last month but is now facing scrutiny and significant revisions in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=14.6s)]
*  the Senate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=18.64s)]
*  As it stands, the House Republican bill would extend and expand Trump's expiring tax cuts [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=19.64s)]
*  from 2017 and would pay for some of those expensive parts with deep cuts to federal [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=23.72s)]
*  anti-poverty programs like Medicaid and food stamps. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=28.54s)]
*  The fresh data factors in the effect of both higher GDP growth and higher interest rates [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=31.98s)]
*  and exceeds the previous estimate of $2.4 trillion. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=36.54s)]
*  So if your concerns about the debt weren't enough already, there's this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=40.1s)]
*  Republican lawmakers have set a deadline of July 4th to send the bill to President Trump's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=43.82s)]
*  desk, but are likely to push that amid disagreements among senators about the impact of the debt [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=47.42s)]
*  and deficit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=52.3s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional reporter for Semaphore Eleanor Mueller. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=53.66s)]
*  Eleanor, the Senate is unveiling the key components of their legislative changes to this bill. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=56.54s)]
*  What's troubling to senators about that? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  What are we hearing from House members who were already concerned about the debt but [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=65.14s)]
*  tried to get over it because of the political currents here? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=68.56s)]
*  What are you making of the changes from the Senate side? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two changes that Senate Republicans themselves have raised concerns about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=73.62s)]
*  One is this more aggressive changes to Medicaid. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=78.1s)]
*  We've seen moderates like Senator Hawley raise concerns over that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=80.98s)]
*  One of the things that we're seeing in the Senate side of particular concern is the fact [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  that they're actually lowering the tax on health care providers that helps pay for Medicare. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  That was kind of a red line for some of those folks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  Susan Collins, who's the chair of the Appropriations Committee, has said that she's worried about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=92.78s)]
*  that too. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=96.26s)]
*  There's also this question of how long to take to phase out the Biden era clean energy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=97.5s)]
*  tax audit. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=102.26s)]
*  And that's something that Senator Tillis told me yesterday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=103.26s)]
*  He's still looking to get more time so that businesses can have as much flexibility in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=106.3s)]
*  ramping down their plans. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  And so those are both issues where I think the conference itself, even in the Senate, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=113.22s)]
*  is raising concerns and trying to make some tweaks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=116.61999999999999s)]
*  As far as the House goes, the main change that I think is problematic for them is this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=120.02s)]
*  idea of this cap on the state and local tax deduction. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=124.38s)]
*  The House passed a bill that would quid-fru bullet to $40,000. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=127.41999999999999s)]
*  It was a big win for blue state Republicans like Mike Lawler. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=130.34s)]
*  And the Senate proposed in its text out this week to bring that all the way back down to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=135.5s)]
*  its current level. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  That provoked a lot of upset among those state moderates who they're going to need to get [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=140.78s)]
*  this thing done in the House. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=144.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's some really fascinating dynamics here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=145.74s)]
*  For example, the fact that we are calling Senator Josh Hawley a moderate in this way. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=148.46s)]
*  I mean, it's fascinating. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=153.3s)]
*  And what does it tell you about this bill and the fact that some of the people who are [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=154.62s)]
*  usually the most aligned with MAGA are actually concerned about it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen some very fascinating alliances coming out of this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  I think, Holly, yeah, it's one great example. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=168.26s)]
*  Again, Susan Collins, another great example. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=169.66s)]
*  These people who are typically pretty staunch conservatives in some ways and on this are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=171.74s)]
*  saying, you know, I think you've taken it too far and I need to pump the brakes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=177.06s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of the same conversations on the rescissions package that Trump sent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=180.1s)]
*  to the Hill that the House just passed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=184.22s)]
*  Susan Collins has said, you know, some of those cuts to foreign aid, they go too far [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=186.22s)]
*  for me and I'm going to have to make some changes before we move this through the Senate. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=189.36s)]
*  Yeah, I do think we're seeing some pretty interesting dynamics here around what it means [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  to be MAGA. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=196.74s)]
*  I think we're also seeing that when it comes to this potential for the U.S. to become directly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=198.34s)]
*  involved in the Israel-Iran conflict. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=203.9s)]
*  I was struck yesterday by the vice president, J.D. Vance, going up to Capitol Hill. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=206.5s)]
*  It seemed like if I was reading between the lines on what he was saying, that he was trying [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=211.58s)]
*  to lay the groundwork, at least for an argument in favor of Trump, if he were to decide to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=216.34s)]
*  do direct strikes or more directly implicate and involve the United States in this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=222.0s)]
*  I mean, talk about what he said, why he was up there, what you saw in that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=226.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=229.74s)]
*  Well, I think it's interesting and notable, first of all, that he came at kind of short notice. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=230.74s)]
*  You know, normally we have a little more advanced warning of the vice president's going to go [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=234.34s)]
*  to the Hill and it was kind of the day off that the White House was like, hey, Vance [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=237.62s)]
*  is going to be at your weekly lunch with Senate Republicans. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=240.22s)]
*  He talked about reconciliation super, super briefly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=244.18s)]
*  I think it was just enough to say, you know, as long as you do this by August, we'll be fine. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=246.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=249.62s)]
*  But most of it he did spend talking about Iran. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=250.62s)]
*  And it's the same message that we've seen, honestly, on almost every single policy issue [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=252.78s)]
*  in this administration, you know, give the president as much flexibility and as much [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=256.22s)]
*  really unconditional support to do whatever he wants to do, regardless of how you might [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=260.5s)]
*  personally feel about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=264.5s)]
*  And we'll see where we end up from there, which is a new tone for this for Congress [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  generally on foreign policy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=270.76000000000005s)]
*  A new tone. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=272.18s)]
*  And then also we were talking about this with Jake Trailer from Politico yesterday, the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=273.18s)]
*  idea that when it comes to an interventionist foreign policy, it is a rift in MAGA world [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=277.5s)]
*  because even there are clips circulating online of an early view of an interview that Tucker [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  Carlson did with Senator Ted Cruz, where they are sparring over whether or not to get involved [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=288.06s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=293.06s)]
*  These two men that are typically on the same side of everything now really going at each [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=294.06s)]
*  other. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  You've got Marjorie Taylor Greene defending Tucker Carlson as the president calls him [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  kooky. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, these are some really strange layers here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  How are you seeing it play out on the Hill? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=306.14s)]
*  Strange bedfellows. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=308.74s)]
*  Strange, strange times. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=309.74s)]
*  One casualty we've seen is this push to enact Russia sanctions. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=311.5s)]
*  Senators basically told us yesterday that they were completely putting that push aside [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=317.3s)]
*  until not only things can settle in the Middle East, but then also for these kind of fault [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=322.7s)]
*  lines on the Hill to cool off a little bit. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=330.1s)]
*  Yeah, we're seeing a lot of a lot of different opinions, a lot of people agreeing with each [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  other who don't normally agree with each other. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=336.7s)]
*  And it's just it's been fascinating to watch. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, for those of us who are students of the Hill and of what it means to be a Republican, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=340.34s)]
*  a Democrat in this day and age, we are really watching some fascinating things unfold in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=345.14s)]
*  real time. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  Eleanor, coming on and breaking down all of those dynamics for us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=350.41999999999996s)]
*  We always appreciate it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=353.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=354.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJAzhHHruwA&t=370.34s)]
