# At least three million customers without power across Florida
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM)
*  Of course have breaking news Hurricane Milton, which made landfall last night as a category three storm near siesta key, Florida [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=0.0s)]
*  carving a path of destruction after slamming along that state's west coast [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=8.24s)]
*  And bringing a life-threatening storm surge and flash flooding [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=13.36s)]
*  Right now Milton has been downgraded to a category one storm with maximum sustained winds at about 85 miles per hour [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=17.6s)]
*  The hurricane battered the state with a number of dangerous tornadoes that destroyed an estimated [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  125 homes in st. Lucie county a tornado proved deadly killing at least two people in a mobile home retirement community [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=33.5s)]
*  The sheriff there now says that his county is in 100 rescue mode [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=42.24s)]
*  Extreme winds also tore down traffic lights scattered debris across roadways [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=47.6s)]
*  And sent a crane as you can see here into a building [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=53.36s)]
*  Over three million homes and businesses are now in the dark after widespread power outages were reported [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now live from Orlando is NBC News correspondent Priscilla Thompson Priscilla. Good morning [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=64.72s)]
*  Could you give us the very latest as to the the conditions there? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  And what the latest is on the ground? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=76.48s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, so let me tell you a little bit about what we're seeing here [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=79.12s)]
*  We are still getting some wind you can see some of these trees blowing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=83.04s)]
*  But at this point the storm is more than 30 miles past us [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  And so we're not getting those super high winds that we saw overnight with Daytona beach getting winds of 80 miles [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=90.4s)]
*  81 miles per hour. We're also seeing some water pooling. But again, it's making its way to the drain [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=96.72s)]
*  This is nothing like what? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=103.92s)]
*  Folks were talking about when we were thinking about those 14 inches of rain that Orlando was potentially going to see [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=106.08s)]
*  But keeping in mind that the rain is still coming down and we don't yet have a sense of what it looks like around [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  The rest of the city [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  I will tell you that a big issue here and really across the state of Florida is the lack of power [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=118.72s)]
*  I'm going to walk you down to this street here and you can see a lot of these businesses here running on generator power [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  But you've got no street lights on this side and you've got street lights on this side [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=130.48s)]
*  So that just gives you a sense of some of the power outages that we're dealing with here [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=135.84s)]
*  But this was an area that worked really hard to prepare the county passed out more than 200,000 sandbags [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=140.16s)]
*  They have been pre-positioning pumps to get the water out if that catastrophic flash flooding did occur [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=146.96s)]
*  And so we'll be out more today looking for some of that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=153.04s)]
*  But we know that that is not the case everywhere there were parts of Tampa that saw that storm surge rushing in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  Potentially deadly storm surge. We're already getting in reports that there are people who have died as a result of this storm [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=163.42s)]
*  There are also injuries you mentioned those tornadoes that swept through overnight [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  Causing a lot of damage in st [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Lucy county with that mangled metal that we saw from that sheriff's structure that was just a pile of mangled muddle metal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=178.0s)]
*  We saw trees that were crashing into homes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=185.92s)]
*  And so that is some of the issues that folks are waking up to as the storm is still moving [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=188.48s)]
*  Making its way out of the state but still a lot of issues on the ground in some areas [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan we're seeing footage right now of one of those tornadoes. They're [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=200.16s)]
*  Just massive and truly dangerous. Um, so priscilla obviously the sun's not up yet [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=204.16s)]
*  So it's difficult to really assess officials have not you know can't it's difficult to know exactly how bad things work [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=208.16s)]
*  Just give us the latest in terms of where you are now. That's from orlando region obviously inland [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  Is there any sense of reports of injuries or deaths? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Um, yeah, so we're here in orlando [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=222.4s)]
*  We know that um fire and the police had to shelter in place at one point overnight [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=225.44s)]
*  But now they are back out on the roads. We haven't seen any reports of injuries or deaths yet here [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=231.12s)]
*  Um, and the big concern here really was the flooding we saw hurricane ian in 2022 just brought [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  devastating flooding to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  Uh the orlando area and so that is really what they have been telling people to prepare for and we spoke to residents here yesterday [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=244.72s)]
*  Who said that they were prepared? They felt like they were going to be okay [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  But of course you never really know especially when those floodwaters start rushing in and of course as you mentioned [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=255.12s)]
*  We're only in one area right now. The sun is still down [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=261.2s)]
*  So we'll have an opportunity to get out and see if there are some of these other areas that may be harder hit [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=264.56s)]
*  But for now real issue [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=270.32s)]
*  The power outages and the potential that as this rain continues coming down even as the storm is moving out [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=272.32s)]
*  We could still see some of that devastating flooding. Jonathan [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=277.68s)]
*  NBC news correspondent priscilla thompson there in orlando. Thank you and stay safe. Let's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=281.36s)]
*  You [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v4VwF779mM&t=299.76s)]
