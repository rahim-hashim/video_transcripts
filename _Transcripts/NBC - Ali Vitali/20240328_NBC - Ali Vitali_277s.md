# Dems see Johnson rescue plan as best bet for Ukraine aid
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw)
*  Meanwhile, as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces mutiny within his own party over the government [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=0.0s)]
*  funding package deal last week, Democrats are discussing what they can get out of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=4.96s)]
*  speaker to save his job. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=9.72s)]
*  The Hill is reporting that should far-right Republicans attempt a coup against their own [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=12.64s)]
*  speaker, Democrats could offer to save him if Johnson then acts on the already passed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=16.12s)]
*  Senate forward aid package. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=22.68s)]
*  That package, of course, includes billions in aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, as well [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=25.72s)]
*  as humanitarian assistance for Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=30.7s)]
*  Joining us now, congressional reporter for the Hill, Michael Schnell, who's been so carefully [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  covering this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=39.22s)]
*  So, Michael, tell us how this would work. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=40.22s)]
*  We saw a similar strategy when Kevin McCarthy was facing an ouster and that deal fell apart. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Do we think Johnson would accept it? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=49.26s)]
*  Would he be willing to take Democrats' help to keep his job in order to get that funding [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=51.3s)]
*  to Ukraine and others? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=57.099999999999994s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, that's the big question here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  Would Johnson rather not be speaker or be a speaker that was, in a way, protected by [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=61.16s)]
*  Democrats? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=66.32s)]
*  That's the big question here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=67.32s)]
*  But look, if this motion to vacate does come to fruition, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor-Green [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=68.32s)]
*  filed it on Friday, said that she could force a vote on it at any time in the near future. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=72.36s)]
*  If she does go ahead with that, a number of Democrats that I've spoken to over the past [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=77.24s)]
*  several days are prepared to step in and protect Johnson. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=81.44s)]
*  And that would happen if he moves forward with Ukraine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  Of course, assistance for Kyiv has stalled on Capitol Hill for months now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  The president put out his supplemental request around September, August of last year. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=92.41999999999999s)]
*  That has not moved in the House because Johnson is facing a number of conservative Republicans [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  who are apprehensive to send more assistance to Kyiv. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  So now what we're seeing some Democrats say is, Speaker Johnson, if you move on this aid, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=106.2s)]
*  or if you putting a Ukraine aid package on the floor is the reason why you face an ouster, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  we will come in and protect you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  And look, that may not look like Democrats voting for Speaker Johnson on the House floor, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=117.64000000000001s)]
*  but there are some procedural things that could go down. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  A motion to table, the motion to vacate would likely come to the floor. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=124.44000000000001s)]
*  Democrats could vote to table that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=128.96s)]
*  And if enough do it and it has a majority of the chamber, that would essentially be [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=130.58s)]
*  And the House can move on with legislative business. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=134.74s)]
*  But of course, the main question here is, would Johnson put that Ukraine on the table? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=136.62s)]
*  And does he want to be a speaker that was in essence protected by Democrats? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=140.94s)]
*  A lot of key questions we'll be watching as Congresswoman Greene continues to dangle this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=144.3s)]
*  motion to vacate. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=148.18s)]
*  And it has, of course, out next week as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=149.18s)]
*  So we won't have any movement on this just yet. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=150.78s)]
*  But Michael, if Johnson goes for this deal and he puts the Ukraine funding on the table, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=152.7s)]
*  what does the rest of his speakership look like? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=159.06s)]
*  Where many Republicans, including those in the far right, would probably say, well, he [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=160.9s)]
*  is just beholden to the Democrats and probably try to oust him again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=163.78s)]
*  Would we be in a dynamic where Democrats would have continually tried to save him? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=166.96s)]
*  How does Johnson possibly govern his own conference? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=170.68s)]
*  I mean, that's another key question here, Jonathan. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=173.48s)]
*  Of course, a lot of unknowns right now as we're waiting to see if this motion to vacate [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=176.0s)]
*  comes to the floor, what Johnson does and how Democrats ultimately react. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=179.96s)]
*  I think there are two ways this could go forward. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=184.0s)]
*  A, you're definitely going to hear from conservative Republicans saying that this is a Democratic [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=186.44s)]
*  speaker, Speaker Johnson propped up by liberals. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=190.84s)]
*  That's the only reason why he's in this position. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=193.46s)]
*  But let's also remember the current dynamics right now in Washington, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=196.06s)]
*  We have a divided city where the Senate and the White House is controlled by Democrats [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=199.52s)]
*  and Republicans are just hanging on to the House by a thread. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=203.82s)]
*  Next month, Congressman Mike Gallagher set to retire early. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=207.44s)]
*  That means that Republicans are going to have just a one vote margin in the House. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=210.84s)]
*  Now, it was difficult for them to get anything done when they had that four seat cushion. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=214.94s)]
*  Now let's talk about how much more difficult it's going to be when they have that one seat [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=219.28s)]
*  edge. So it's very possible that if Johnson has to go down this route of passing Ukraine aid [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=223.12s)]
*  and getting help from Democrats, his response can be, well, look, this is divided government. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=228.04s)]
*  You know, if we had a bigger majority, if we would have done better in the 2022 midterm elections, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  we wouldn't be in this situation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=237.32s)]
*  We'd be handling legislative issues in a very different manner. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  But we have a very small majority in a divided Washington. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=241.92s)]
*  This is how things are right now. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdeYgrD7Kw&t=244.84s)]
