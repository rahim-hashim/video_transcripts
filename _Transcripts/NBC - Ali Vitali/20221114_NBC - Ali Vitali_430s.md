# Biden And Xi Meet Us U.S.-China Tensions Rise
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA)
*  Good morning and welcome to Way Too Early on this Monday, November 14th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Sam Stein in Washington alongside Jonathan Lemire, who's reporting live this morning [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=7.16s)]
*  from Bali, Indonesia. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=11.76s)]
*  President Joe Biden will hold a news conference in just a few hours as he meets with Chinese [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=14.8s)]
*  President Xi Jinping, their first in-person visit since Biden took office. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=19.78s)]
*  Biden's amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over technology, Taiwan, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=25.16s)]
*  and China's tacit support of Russia's war on Ukraine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=30.36s)]
*  But President Biden is counting on his personal relationship with Xi to establish red line [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=33.92s)]
*  issues. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  I know I'm coming in stronger, but I don't need that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=39.980000000000004s)]
*  I know Xi Jinping. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=43.56s)]
*  I've spent more time than any other world leader. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=44.56s)]
*  I know him well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=46.44s)]
*  He knows me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=47.44s)]
*  There's no, we have very little misunderstanding. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=48.44s)]
*  We just got to figure out where the red lines are and what are the most important things [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=51.24s)]
*  to each of us going into the next two years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  And his circumstances change, to state the obvious, at home. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=58.36s)]
*  So we're going to have a, I think, I've always had straightforward discussion. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=64.12s)]
*  There's never any miscalculation about what each of us, where each of us stands. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  I think that's critically important in our relationship. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=76.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=81.12s)]
*  Joining us now live from Bali, Indonesia, the host of Way Too Early, the star of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=82.12s)]
*  summit himself, White House Bureau Chief Appolitico, Jonathan Lemire. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=86.32s)]
*  Jonathan, how is it going? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=90.4s)]
*  First off, what is Biden hoping to get out of this meeting with Xi? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=92.48s)]
*  What were your impressions of the two coming face to face at that bilat? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  Sam, good to talk to you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=101.68s)]
*  Thanks for holding down the fort there in Washington. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=105.72s)]
*  This is the most important summit of this president's term to this point. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=108.36s)]
*  Both he and Xi Jinping of China come in emboldened. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  Xi Jinping just received another five year term ahead. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=115.44s)]
*  The Chinese government, of course, President Biden's party, the Democrats have held on [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=118.8s)]
*  to the Senate, still have an outside shot at the House. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=122.52s)]
*  Certainly he has political wind at his back as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot on the agenda here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=128.16s)]
*  It's trade, it's economics, it's Taiwan. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=130.28s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be much in the way of a sense of deliverables, things that will [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  be concrete accomplishments from this meeting here in sweltering Bali, Indonesia. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=136.84s)]
*  But they're meeting at all as seen as a good step. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  These two superpowers sitting down together for the first time since Biden took office, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  hoping to avoid another cold war. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  And I'd like to bring into the conversation right now here in Bali, Indonesia. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=152.12s)]
*  Step on in is National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications, John Kirby. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=155.16000000000003s)]
*  John, thank you. Admiral Kirby, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  We just heard very brief introductory remarks from President Biden and President Xi, both [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=163.2s)]
*  stressing the need for cooperation to find some common ground. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=168.48s)]
*  What could some of those areas of common ground be? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think certainly climate change. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=173.68s)]
*  I mean, that's something that affects everybody, including China, of course, better bilateral [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=175.28s)]
*  and even multilateral trade and economic practices. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  Certainly terrorism is something that both China and the United States are facing around [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=184.88s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  The threat of another pandemic and so global health, food security, even energy security [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=190.0s)]
*  will be on the agenda. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=194.68s)]
*  So the there are obviously a number of flashpoints of tension. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=196.08s)]
*  What will President Biden's message be today on Taiwan? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=200.4s)]
*  I think his message is going to be very, very consistent, Jonathan, with what he has said [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  before, what we've said before. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=208.8s)]
*  One one, a one China policy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  We don't want to see the status quo across the street be changed unilaterally, certainly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=212.44s)]
*  not by force. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=217.24s)]
*  He's going to make it clear that we're not seeking a conflict with China, but we are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=218.4s)]
*  seeking good competition. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=221.24s)]
*  And he's going to feel very comfortable about the United States ability to compete right [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=222.8s)]
*  now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=226.24s)]
*  Now, he is President Biden has said that this relationship should be a competition. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=227.24s)]
*  He certainly doesn't understand it will be a competition. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  He's really trying to ratchet down some tensions to prevent this from becoming potentially [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=233.44000000000003s)]
*  another Cold War. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  But one area of disagreement, of course, is the approach towards Russia, where China has [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=240.28000000000003s)]
*  been supportive of Vladimir Putin to this point, Putin, we should mention skipping the G20 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=246.0s)]
*  here in Indonesia, but has not outright condemned the invasion as well and though has not supplied [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=250.28s)]
*  arms, has continued to provide economic lifeline to Moscow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=256.36s)]
*  What will President Biden say to Xi Jinping about Vladimir Putin? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=260.48s)]
*  His message will be the same. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=263.88s)]
*  I think that he's he's made to countries around the world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=265.0s)]
*  Nobody, nobody should be helping Russia kill innocent Ukrainian people, which is what they're [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=267.64s)]
*  doing right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=272.76s)]
*  Make no mistake about it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=273.76s)]
*  So I think you'll be very firm about that, that that we want the whole international [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=275.0s)]
*  community to continue to find ways to isolate Russia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, here to for President Xi hasn't been willing to do that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  That's not been China's stance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=285.0s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  They continue to buy Russian oil. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=287.52s)]
*  Why? We're pursuing a price cap on oil to kind of limit the ability for Mr. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  Putin to profiteer off of that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  Now, you're right. They have they haven't condemned the invasion, but they also haven't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=295.4s)]
*  materially supported Russia in terms of military equipment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  And Admiral Kirby, Sam Stein in Washington has the next question for you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, thank you so much. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  I know it's hard to read into these opening statements at these bilats, but let me ask [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=309.64000000000004s)]
*  you to read into it a little bit here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=315.56s)]
*  I was struck by how President Xi said things like a statesman should be known for how they [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=317.48s)]
*  lead their country. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=323.36s)]
*  And it's not that the current relationship is not what the international community expects [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=324.36s)]
*  of us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=329.44s)]
*  What's your read of that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=330.44s)]
*  It seemed to me, at least, that he was saying he'd like to tone down the tensions, that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=331.84s)]
*  there may be common ground. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=337.4s)]
*  But obviously implicit in those comments are that things need to get better. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  They need to improve. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=343.44s)]
*  I'm just curious what your read of that exchange was. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=344.44s)]
*  Yeah, I won't speak for President Xi, obviously, or try to characterize his comments. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=349.76s)]
*  I can tell you that President Biden comes into this meeting very much wanting to have [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  a common set of understandings about a range of issues, issues that we believe we can cooperate [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=358.36s)]
*  with China on and issues where obviously there's tension, Taiwan, Russia and Ukraine, and of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=363.44s)]
*  course, trade and fair economic practices, as well as freedom of navigation. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=369.76s)]
*  All these are issues that President Biden wants to raise with President Xi and wants [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=373.68s)]
*  to establish sort of a foundation now for the relationship going forward. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=377.24s)]
*  Clearly coming out of the party Congress, he knows President Xi has now more time in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=381.56s)]
*  office and he wants to make sure that we can set a proper foundation for this relationship [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=387.04s)]
*  going forward. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=391.12s)]
*  The President understands this is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=392.12s)]
*  world, the United States and China, and he wants to make sure that that relationship [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=397.4s)]
*  is properly serving American national security interests. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=401.72s)]
*  All right, Admiral Kirby, Jonathan Lemire, thank you both very much. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=404.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tkt44eCFA&t=417.0s)]
