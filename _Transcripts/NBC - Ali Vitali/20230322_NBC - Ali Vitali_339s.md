# Democrats see downside in Trump's NY case
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ)
*  Joining us now with a look at Axios AM political reporter for Axios Alexi [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  McCammon. Alexi great to see you here on set. What is the Axios one big thing this [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=5.24s)]
*  morning? Good morning good to see you. I know this is something you've been [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=9.4s)]
*  having conversations with Democratic Party operatives, officials, Trump [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=13.08s)]
*  critics, prosecutors. There's a real growing sense of unease among some folks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=16.72s)]
*  on the left about the legal merits and political peril that could come with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=21.16s)]
*  this case from Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg against former president Donald Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=24.88s)]
*  Obviously they have been wanting to see former President Trump held to account [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=28.36s)]
*  under the law since arguably his first impeachment trial but now that he's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=32.08s)]
*  facing his first big legal test the conversations I've been having with [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=36.72s)]
*  folks they're worried that they're sort of saying why would this be the first [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=39.72s)]
*  case? This isn't as legally sound as the other case that the Manhattan D.A. was [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=43.2s)]
*  previously looking into into his financial assets and record-keeping. They [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  worry that it will undermine the legitimacy of the other investigations [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  that are happening into Donald Trump and what that could mean for those things. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=55.2s)]
*  And look Republicans on the Hill are already turning this into a political [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=58.92s)]
*  spectacle that Democrats have to respond to in some way and so far they're just [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  not. Right and we should remind viewers that Trump also an under investigation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=66.72s)]
*  for potential election interference in Georgia, mishandling classified documents [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago and January 6th. But you're right it is this it is this delicate [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=73.4s)]
*  balancing act because of course there is that theory that no man or woman is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=77.72s)]
*  above the law they should be held in account. Well and the thing is it's like [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=80.72s)]
*  you know folks will say it's not it's a trivial matter with Stormy Daniels and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  the hush money but compared to those other things you just pointed out those [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=88.44s)]
*  are certainly more significant you know to democracy. And the fear is that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=92.04s)]
*  Trump can use this to discredit all the rest and we're seeing his colleagues try [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=96.28s)]
*  to do that already because Axios has got some new reporting that House [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=101.28s)]
*  Republicans are really want to question Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg about the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=104.04s)]
*  potential indictment but some others in the party aren't quite as keen on it in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  the Senate. Tell us about the breakdown. Yeah that's right there's this kind of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  interesting split happening between House and Senate Republicans also a [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  split within the Senate Republican caucus about how they feel about House [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=118.36s)]
*  Republicans launching what is otherwise an unprecedented federal investigation [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=122.48s)]
*  into a local office and official especially for an ongoing investigation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=126.56s)]
*  There's no indication that Bragg will comply but they want him to come [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=131.32s)]
*  testify on the Hill to talk about this investigation into Trump. Senate [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  Republicans some like Senators John Cornyn, Tom Tillis, Texas, North Carolina [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=138.9s)]
*  they're sort of saying look House Republicans should focus on their agenda [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=143.3s)]
*  and what the American people care about. Others though Ted Cruz and others are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=146.66s)]
*  sort of saying yeah we should go for it we should investigate Alvin Bragg into [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=151.06s)]
*  what he's doing to get to the bottom of all these questions that we have. Yeah [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=155.18s)]
*  some of the ideas being thrown out there pretty dangerous in terms of trying to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=158.78s)]
*  interfere with another branch of government. Let's talk a little bit about [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=162.82s)]
*  Johnathan Allen was out here a short time ago and suggested that people that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=166.42s)]
*  he talked to in the Republican Party think that an indictment if Manhattan [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=170.73999999999998s)]
*  DA indictment only helped Trump politically at least in the primary. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=174.1s)]
*  General election is a different story and against that backdrop we are seeing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=177.42s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis start to hit back. You know to this point it had [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=181.66s)]
*  been so one-sided Trump attacks DeSantis, DeSantis ignores him but now we're [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  seeing DeSantis lash out a little bit. Tell us about what you've heard in terms [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=189.06s)]
*  of the thinking there as to why now DeSantis takes the gloves off. Well look I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=192.34s)]
*  mean everyone is looking to DeSantis to figure out when he's going to announce [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=196.66s)]
*  his presidential run. He's clearly flirting with the idea more openly now [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=199.58s)]
*  than ever before. He just made his first remark kind of a cheap shot at Trump [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  about this whole indictment situation but the interesting thing that DeSantis [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=208.02s)]
*  is doing right now ahead of an expected announcement is really proving to people [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  in these different remarks and interviews that he's Trump without the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  baggage. He's saying I'm not going to fight with him online, it doesn't serve [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=220.66s)]
*  the people of Florida, I don't care about the nicknames, I don't know what they [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=224.54s)]
*  mean, I think we need a leader who has strong character like founding fathers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=228.1s)]
*  Those to me are just ways that he's saying pick me I'm Trump but I'm not [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  gonna have all the drama and chaos around Trump and that's obviously the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=237.98s)]
*  theory of the case from people around him that's a theory of the case from [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  some voters who like DeSantis instead of Trump that we've heard from that they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=244.1s)]
*  think he is similar enough to this MAGA type of leader but won't have all this [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=248.1s)]
*  confusing chaos and drama around him all the time and that's I think what that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=251.94s)]
*  Piers Morgan interview showed the most. Yeah and so far anyway the anti-Trump [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=255.7s)]
*  forces on the Republican Party seem to be coalescing around DeSantis, we'll see [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=259.82s)]
*  if that persists. Lastly let's switch gears, Teacher Strike in Los Angeles, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=263.74s)]
*  it's the second largest school district in the United States, a significant [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  impact to the children there but there are political ramifications too. Yeah I [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=273.18s)]
*  mean hundreds of families are now scrambling to sort of figure out what to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=276.06s)]
*  do, you have kids so I can't imagine what this would mean for you but look the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  realities are that this could spill into not just California politics but [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=283.3s)]
*  national politics, teachers are obviously a huge voting bloc and critical [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  constituency for any race really but especially with Democrats and especially [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=291.02000000000004s)]
*  in a presidential and LA has been in the spotlight for a number of reasons [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=295.18s)]
*  especially given Gavin Newsom, Governor Gavin Newsom wants to keep it the whole [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=298.94s)]
*  state in the spotlight and and really show himself as this Democratic surrogate [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=303.26s)]
*  but this of course is you know not a story that looks good for what he's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=306.98s)]
*  doing. And a highly competitive Senate race on the horizon there in California [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=311.3s)]
*  as well. Alexi McKinnon thank you we'll talk to you a little later on Morning Joe. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EDQi08XMIQ&t=314.74s)]
