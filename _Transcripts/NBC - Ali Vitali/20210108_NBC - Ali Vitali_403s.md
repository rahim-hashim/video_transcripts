**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 08, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes)
*  The cabinet should meet and have a discussion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't think it will happen, but I think the cabinet should meet and discuss this, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=5.28s)]
*  because the behavior yesterday and the weeks and months before that has just been outrageous [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=10.96s)]
*  from the president. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=16.36s)]
*  And what happened on Capitol Hill yesterday is a direct result of his poisoning the minds [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=18.32s)]
*  of people with the lies and the frauds. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=24.76s)]
*  If you were in the cabinet right now, would you vote to remove him from office? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=27.92s)]
*  Yes, I would. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=33.64s)]
*  That was former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly telling CNN yesterday that if he [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=40.0s)]
*  were a member of the president's cabinet, he would support invoking the 25th Amendment [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  after the rioting at the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=48.74s)]
*  Kelly joins the dozens of Democrats who are also calling for the 25th Amendment to be [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=51.52s)]
*  including my next guest, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=56.16s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks so much for being here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=60.36s)]
*  We appreciate you getting up early after what has been a really difficult set of days with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=62.2s)]
*  some very long nights. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=67.24s)]
*  Let's talk about where things stand in terms of the 25th Amendment. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=69.36s)]
*  What are you hearing behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, especially from I know you have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=73.4s)]
*  good relationships with your Republican colleagues. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=78.44s)]
*  Does the president still have support from them in Congress? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=81.48s)]
*  Well, I think that as we saw what happened even after the violence at the Capitol, there [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=86.0s)]
*  are a significant number of Republicans that are still supporting him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=91.92s)]
*  At the same time, there are also a surprisingly broad section of Republicans from members [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  of the Freedom Caucus to more moderate Republicans who are deeply disturbed by what's happened. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=104.48s)]
*  I believe he I mean, even yesterday, Ted Cruz said he bears some responsibility for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=109.56s)]
*  what happened, and they are concerned about the damage that can be done in the next 12 [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=116.4s)]
*  days now that we are down to. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=122.28s)]
*  I think the question is, how do you hold this president accountable for his actions? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=125.68s)]
*  How do you keep any real damage? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=131.28s)]
*  And there's still 12 days. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=134.2s)]
*  There's significant damage that can still occur in those 12 days. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=135.76s)]
*  And how do you bring the country together at the same time? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=139.56s)]
*  I think Democrats are at a point that that something's got to happen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=143.24s)]
*  So what's the plan in the event we don't see Mike Pence's signal of willingness and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=150.24s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi both said publicly they tried to reach Pence, they didn't. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=156.6s)]
*  So they went out and they said this in public in front of all the cameras. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=160.84s)]
*  Pelosi said we expect to hear from him by the end of the day. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=164.2s)]
*  We haven't really gotten a clear answer one way or the other. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=167.2s)]
*  So if Pence declines in some way, sends a signal he's declining to invoke the 25th [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=169.56s)]
*  Amendment, what what will you Democrats in the House do then? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=175.16s)]
*  OK, I think we kind of got that signal last night when people were reporting that he [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=179.6s)]
*  did not think that that was the way that we should go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  And you've seen two women members of the cabinet resign in the last 24 hours. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=186.92s)]
*  I think their contribution to history could have been made in a different way. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  But I don't think the 25th Amendment is looking as real as many people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=196.92s)]
*  And I do know that there are public members that thought that that was the way to go. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=201.44s)]
*  I think that Democrats are going to move forward with another impeachment because they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=205.92s)]
*  do believe that he must be held accountable for his actions that triggered, contributed, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  encouraged, inflamed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=215.92s)]
*  What happened at the largest symbol of democracy in this country two days ago? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=217.6s)]
*  Wow, that's that sounds pretty newsworthy to me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=222.2s)]
*  What do you think that that looks like? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=225.6s)]
*  I mean, is the House going to be called back to Washington? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=227.12s)]
*  Do you expect articles would be introduced quickly and passed? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=229.44s)]
*  I mean, the time is of the essence. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=232.48s)]
*  I think you'll see it's not a decision one person makes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Our leadership is there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  Chuck Dumer and Nancy Pelosi are talking. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that this is a totally done decision, but now there are more than 200 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=242.48s)]
*  members in the House that believe that something must happen. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=246.2s)]
*  There will be a Democratic caucus meeting today at noon. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=250.04s)]
*  Members will express their opinions. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=252.6s)]
*  But I think that there is a great deal of discussion. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  I have talked to multiple, multiple members, and I think that that is the direction that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=259.04s)]
*  we are headed. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=269.48s)]
*  Now, there's one week left. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=270.36s)]
*  There are nine days left on Monday. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=271.6s)]
*  So, you know, the House can move quickly and move it again. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  But then the question is, can the Senate hold a trial that quickly? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=280.92s)]
*  I think that the real question, I will be very, very honest, is how do we minimize any [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=285.48s)]
*  further damage for the remaining days in this administration? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=290.76s)]
*  And what you saw in the Capitol is one of the consequences. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=293.88s)]
*  But there are a lot of other things that can happen and that we all and I'm going to say [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=298.48s)]
*  this to my Republican colleagues and to the members of the Cabinet and to Vice President [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=303.04s)]
*  Pence. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=308.4s)]
*  You have responsibility to this country to make sure there is no further damage to this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=309.08s)]
*  democracy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=314.0s)]
*  So do you think, I mean, what is Chuck Schumer saying behind the scenes about whether there [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=316.4s)]
*  may be support among Senate Republicans to actually vote to impeach? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=322.08s)]
*  I have talked to a lot of Republicans. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=327.36s)]
*  I don't think that you're going to see a significant amount of Republican support for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  impeachment. But that doesn't mean, you know, the dynamics are moving very, very quickly. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=339.84s)]
*  You are, I mean, you're seeing all of this. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=344.64s)]
*  And by the way, I want to say that as you're talking about security at the Capitol and how [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=348.4s)]
*  did this happen, there are really very conflicting reports that even if you look at what [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=353.84s)]
*  Larry Hogan said yesterday about his wanting to send the National Guard, but he wasn't [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=359.16s)]
*  being authorized. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  We need the facts. We need the truth. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  How the hell did this happen in the United States of America? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=366.6s)]
*  And people need to be held accountable. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  And there are conflicting facts. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=370.92s)]
*  And people like me need to know the real facts. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=372.6s)]
*  Well, and you all are in power to find out. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  And we obviously will be paying very close attention. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=381.40000000000003s)]
*  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, thank you very much for an always illuminating conversation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=383.56s)]
*  I really appreciate your candidness with us today. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=387.44s)]
*  Thanks for getting up early. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crhj03wxJes&t=390.16s)]
