# GOP senator blocks federal bill to protect IVF
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms)
*  A Republican senator has blocked the passage of a bill to protect access to in vitro fertilization [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=0.0s)]
*  nationwide. Senator Sidney Hyde-Smith of Mississippi objected to the measure's approval yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=6.28s)]
*  The bill was introduced by Democrat Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who sought to pass [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=12.88s)]
*  it by unanimous consent in light of the recent Alabama state Supreme Court ruling. But Hyde-Smith [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=16.8s)]
*  said the bill goes too far. Take a listen. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=23.04s)]
*  I support the ability for mothers and fathers to have total access to IVF and bringing new [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=27.44s)]
*  life into the world. I also believe human life should be protected. These are not mutually [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  exclusive. Let's be clear about what the Alabama case is about. This was a case brought [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=41.64s)]
*  by families whose human embryos were killed when an unauthorized individual walked into [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=48.32s)]
*  the fertility clinic through an unsecured door, removed several human embryos and dropped [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  them causing their deaths. The court's holding in favor of the parents found that these frozen [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=60.48s)]
*  human embryos are children under Alabama law. It did not ban IVF, nor has any state [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=68.12s)]
*  banned IVF. The bill before us today is a vast overreach that is full of poison pills [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=77.16s)]
*  that go way too far. Joining us now, former White House Director of Communications to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=85.56s)]
*  President Obama and the Director of Communications for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Jen Palmieri. Jen, also an MSNBC political analyst. Good to see you this morning. So [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=96.6s)]
*  let's talk about the politics of IVF. After that Alabama decision, it seems like most [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  Republicans went trying to run away from it, but we're seeing here on the Senate floor, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=105.52s)]
*  that's going to be hard to do. Give us your sense of the continued fallout. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=110.32s)]
*  Yeah, the very first time that there is legislation involving IVF comes a Republican stand up [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  and blocks it. So it is that it's another clarifying moment to show that, you know, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=119.92s)]
*  that I think is going to be a huge deal in the in the it's going to be a huge deal in [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=126.56s)]
*  the fall. And every, you know, every couple of months something happens in the reproductive [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=130.48s)]
*  right space that remind people of just what a shocking and consequential development of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=134.48s)]
*  overturning Roe v. Wade was right. And I think IVF, if you've been studying the issue for 10 years, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=140.64s)]
*  you saw this coming. You saw this as a goal of the more extreme elements, the right to life movement [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  to get at IVF. But it was really shocking when it happened. And Republicans are trying to backpedal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=151.44s)]
*  But, you know, people just don't they just don't buy it. Even when you remember when Glenn [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=156.48s)]
*  Youngkin in Virginia, the Virginia Republican governor, tried to pursue as a campaign strategy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=160.64s)]
*  to win Republican seats in his state legislature, a what he considered to be a moderate 15 week ban. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=166.48s)]
*  And voters rejected that, you know, with the big margins so much so that Democrats picked up seats [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  there. It's like they don't trust Republicans on these. They don't trust Republicans and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=179.2s)]
*  reproductive rights issues. It's it's it's trust women. And this is another that Hyde Smith. It's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=183.44s)]
*  like a you know, there you go. That's all you need to know when it comes to protecting women. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=188.32s)]
*  They vote now. They stand in the way. So, Jen, let's go back to our top story this morning. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  So many Democrats I heard from yesterday in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to hear the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=197.04s)]
*  Trump case, which therefore could either could delay the trial till up against the election or [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=201.84s)]
*  even beyond the election. Democrats saying, oh, I'm going to get away with it again. This is going [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=207.12s)]
*  to happen again. How does this keep happening? But get your get let's get your reaction to that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=211.6s)]
*  But also, it seems to me that Democrats shouldn't be banking on the magic bullet of a court case to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=216.64s)]
*  take down Donald Trump. They've just simply got to beat him in the campaign. Exactly. And I have never [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  the trials have never really factored into my calculus of how Joe Biden wins. And I think what [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=228.16s)]
*  is so I don't think I don't see this as a major setback for the election. It was always going to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=237.04s)]
*  have to be voters turning him out. But I think it's sort of unnerving for us all, because even [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=242.72s)]
*  those of us who saw you saw this court overturned Roby Bay, they understand it, the extreme court. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=248.32s)]
*  But we thought that they would take this presidential immunity case seriously. And for [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=253.68s)]
*  them to delay it as much as they have, that is very unsettling. That gives you the sense of maybe [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=257.68s)]
*  it's already too late. Maybe we've already lost the democracy. I think we're people are going to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=263.44s)]
*  feel uneasy about this for a little bit, but then we'll come back and Democrats will come back, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=267.6s)]
*  continue the fight. But this was always going to have to be resolved on Election Day. I would say [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=271.68s)]
*  Biden campaign aides have been clear. They weren't banking on the court cases to take out Trump. They [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=276.64s)]
*  know they have to do the work. And Jen, and lastly, in our last minute here, give us you. We mentioned [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  earlier the dueling border visits from Trump and Biden today, 300 miles apart. What does President [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=286.48s)]
*  Biden need to do today? I think he needs to show, you know, he's team. He's team democracy, their [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=291.92s)]
*  team chaos, right? It's always a big, it's the core issue for Trump. Biden's not going to, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=298.96s)]
*  it's not going to overtake Trump on whether or not people think that he's doing a good [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=305.76s)]
*  job on immigration. Trump will always have that advantage. But Biden is team democracy. He goes [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=310.0s)]
*  down there to show we are trying to solve the problem. We are facing the problem. We've done a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  lot to solve the problem, and they are the ones standing in the way, and they are doing it for [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=319.84s)]
*  political reasons. So Trump, so Biden has a different charge down there than Trump. And I [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=324.56s)]
*  think it's important that he's doing this to show that he is trying to tackle the problem and it's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=328.96s)]
*  their politics that are standing in the way. That, you know, so he has a different job to do down [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=333.68s)]
*  there than what Trump is trying to achieve, which is more showboating. Right. To remind voters that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump himself said, hey, preserve immigration as a campaign issue. And therefore, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=344.16s)]
*  the Republicans made that bill go away. Biden is going to hear, we're hearing from today saying, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=348.08s)]
*  I was going to sign it. Jen Palmieri, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdOjuhBE0ms&t=352.08s)]
