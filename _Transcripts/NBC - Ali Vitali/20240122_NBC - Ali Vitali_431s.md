# Nikki Haley on NH primary: It's not about winning
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU)
*  It's a state. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=0.0s)]
*  I've been consistent from the very beginning. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=1.62s)]
*  What I said is I want to be strong in Iowa. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=3.44s)]
*  I want to be even stronger in New Hampshire. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=5.32s)]
*  And then I want to be stronger in South Carolina. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=7.28s)]
*  So strong in New Hampshire doesn't mean necessarily winning it as being a strong second? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=8.28s)]
*  We won't know until the numbers come out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=11.88s)]
*  But making sure that we continue to be strong. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=13.76s)]
*  I want to be stronger than I was in Iowa. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=15.84s)]
*  And then we're going to South Carolina. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=17.82s)]
*  That was Nikki Haley on Fox News downplaying a raft of recent polling that shows her trailing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=20.72s)]
*  Donald Trump by double digits in New Hampshire ahead of tomorrow's primary. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=26.04s)]
*  Joining us now, contributor to the conservative website, the Bullwork, Tim Miller. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=30.56s)]
*  He previously served as communications director for Jeb Bush and spokesman for the Republican [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=34.92s)]
*  National Committee. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=39.24s)]
*  Tim, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=40.24s)]
*  So you wrote about Nikki Haley and your last piece for the Bullwork. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=41.24s)]
*  You wrote about the challenges and obstacles she faces in New Hampshire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=44.92s)]
*  Give us your diagnosis. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=48.32s)]
*  Look, obviously she ran a better campaign than Ron DeSantis did, Jonathan. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=49.32s)]
*  But there's not much, that's not enough to win the nomination, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=55.88s)]
*  And if you look at her coalition in New Hampshire, it's just not a winning Republican coalition. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  It's one I kind of wish was a winning Republican coalition. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=66.06s)]
*  She has a handful of anti-Trump Republicans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=68.44s)]
*  She's doing well with undeclared voters, people that are going to cross over to vote in a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=71.28s)]
*  Republican primary. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=75.16s)]
*  But there aren't a lot of those voters in the other states. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=76.84s)]
*  And if you just look at the way that the party has coalesced around Donald Trump, you know [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=79.12s)]
*  what I call the new MAGA establishment, Donald Trump's been getting the endorsements from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=84.24s)]
*  even Ron DeSantis, who he mocked throughout the whole campaign. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=88.96s)]
*  You know, he got them from Tim Scott and Marco Rubio. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=91.36s)]
*  The Fox and the other major conservative media sites are rallying around the flag. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=95.64s)]
*  Nikki Haley is kind of running around with Judge Judy and Chris Sununu and Larry Hogan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  That's not what the Republican Party is in 2024. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, and he's been a staunch opponent of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  former President Trump and backing Nikki Haley. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  But Tim, just days before his state's critical primary, he folded when pressed on whether [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  he would back Trump if Trump were to be the party's nominee. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=123.44s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=126.28s)]
*  I don't care what political party you're from, whether you're an extreme conservative or [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=127.28s)]
*  socialist liberal, everybody should be concerned with that type of mentality going into the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=131.36s)]
*  White House. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=135.04s)]
*  And yet you are saying if he is the nominee that you are going to support him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=136.04s)]
*  How can you say that you'll support him? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=140.68s)]
*  At the end of the day, I think most Republicans are going to get behind the Republican nominee. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm hoping that it's obviously Nikki Haley. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=146.28s)]
*  Despite his comments on immunity, despite what you said about the insurrection, you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=148.44s)]
*  would still vote for Donald Trump in a general election? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=152.28s)]
*  According to the polls, most of America would. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=154.72s)]
*  So Tim, that's just it, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=156.8s)]
*  That's the Republican Party in 2024. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=159.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's the Nikki Haley surrogate you just showed, or best one. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=161.08s)]
*  It's kind of breathtaking, really, the cowardice of these folks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  What Chris Sununu is doing, in my opinion, is actually more damaging than what a MAGA [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=169.84s)]
*  Republican endorsing Trump would do. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=174.92s)]
*  He's kind of giving cover for these swing voters in the general election, saying, well, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  I prefer Haley, but still Trump is better than Biden. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=181.48s)]
*  I think that's extremely damaging. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=184.56s)]
*  I don't think he really believes it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=187.48s)]
*  I think that it's also false. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=188.92s)]
*  But this is what these guys feel like they need to stay relevant. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  That's why when Ron DeSantis drops out yesterday, you see kind of in minute three of his comments [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  in his concession video, him saying that he's for Trump because he doesn't want to go back [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=199.68s)]
*  to the corporatist GOP. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  What are you even talking about? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  You're worried about Nikki Haley wants corporate tax? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=207.44s)]
*  It doesn't even make sense. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=210.52s)]
*  But they're just trying to come up with a post facto rationalization for supporting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  somebody that tried to overthrow our democracy. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=219.32s)]
*  And you mentioned Tim Scott. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=220.32s)]
*  He also just backed Trump. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=221.32s)]
*  He had kept quiet for a few weeks. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  What's significant when he delivered it, you know, before New Hampshire, not even waiting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=228.92s)]
*  to South Carolina. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=231.76s)]
*  Of course, Tim Scott, Nikki Haley have a long relationship, but yet Scott still backing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=232.76s)]
*  Trump instead. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=236.6s)]
*  Haley, of course, appointed him to the Senate when she was governor at the time. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=237.6s)]
*  Here's how Haley reacted. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, this is everybody has a decision to make and they have to live with their decision. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=243.0s)]
*  He'll have to live with his. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  What I know is we're going to continue to go forward. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=250.0s)]
*  Trump has focused a lot of time on getting as many Washington insiders, elected officials, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=253.08s)]
*  endorsements as he can. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=259.16s)]
*  So there we have it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=261.6s)]
*  Another another evidence to your point, Tim, of Republicans crawling back to Trump. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=262.6s)]
*  And you mentioned DeSantis. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=267.24s)]
*  Give us. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=268.24s)]
*  I mean, this is someone who Trump called Ron DeSantimonious and Meatball Rob and every [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=269.24s)]
*  other breath for almost a year now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=272.88s)]
*  And as you say, he instantly, instantly endorsed endorsed Trump. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=275.68s)]
*  So beyond just what that says about today's GOP, give us your postmortem for the DeSantis [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=280.04s)]
*  campaign. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, firstly, just the cowardice of both Scott and DeSantis. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  These guys didn't even try. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=289.04s)]
*  None of these folks even tried to run a campaign against Trump. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=290.04s)]
*  They're all folding before the first primary. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=293.04s)]
*  We've only had one caucus. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=294.72s)]
*  It's just utterly shameful that this is the timing of these endorsements. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=296.20000000000005s)]
*  As far as DeSantis, I think he missed a big opportunity to get in the race right after [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=299.44s)]
*  the midterms and to take advantage of the momentum from that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  Instead, he had this Florida legislative session that he spent six months working on, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=307.76s)]
*  trying to get to Donald Trump's right on the culture war. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=312.44s)]
*  You can't get to Donald Trump's right on the culture war. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=314.82s)]
*  We learned that in 2016. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=317.18s)]
*  For some reason, Ron DeSantis decided to run Ted Cruz's campaign with even less personality. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  That was doomed for the start. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=324.64s)]
*  I don't really understand why that was the strategic approach. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=325.96s)]
*  I think had he had he started to run right after November and run just on electability, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=329.2s)]
*  Florida versus the failure of all the Donald Trump candidates, probably still wouldn't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=334.96s)]
*  have happened because of his not so great candidate skills. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=338.52s)]
*  I think he would have had a much better shot. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=341.44s)]
*  Tim, lastly, New Hampshire is tomorrow. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=346.96s)]
*  Do you see any scenario where Haley could pull a surprise either with an upset win or [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=347.96s)]
*  a narrow loss? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  Or is she going to get lose by double digits and we're going to wake up Wednesday morning [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  and she's going to probably bow out so she doesn't get humiliated at home in South Carolina [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=357.52s)]
*  and the race, the primaries will already be over? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=361.36s)]
*  Yeah, I think it already is over, unfortunately. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  She could surprise. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=367.76s)]
*  If I was betting, I would say that she's going to lose by more than 10. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=368.76s)]
*  But who knows what those undeclared voters in New Hampshire are going to do? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=372.0s)]
*  There isn't really a meaningful Democratic primary. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nHs0P-8thU&t=374.68s)]
