# Anti-Ukraine rhetoric among 2024 GOP contenders
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ)
*  Meanwhile, potentially a significant headline here, as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis reportedly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=0.0s)]
*  weighs a 2024 presidential run, he is calling on the United States to detangle itself from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=5.24s)]
*  the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=11.72s)]
*  In an answer to a Fox News questionnaire released this week, DeSantis told Tucker Carlson's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  show that, quote, while the U.S. has many vital national interests, becoming further [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=19.72s)]
*  entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=25.4s)]
*  He later accused the Biden administration of, quote, driving Russia into a de facto alliance [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=31.36s)]
*  with China and empowering Putin's war machine at America's expense. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=36.48s)]
*  Joining us now, co-founder of Punchball News, Anna Palmer. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  She is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  We're always happy to have her with us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Let's start with Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=52.76s)]
*  Even though neither Pence nor DeSantis have announced a run, Trump certainly treated them [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=54.96s)]
*  like candidates and most expect that they will be soon enough. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=58.88s)]
*  He has gone on the offense. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=62.8s)]
*  He's taking advantage of being the first one in, increased the media attention that comes [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=64.2s)]
*  with that, and he has gone attacking them on a daily basis, particularly DeSantis. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=68.56s)]
*  What stands out to you here about this strategy? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=73.06s)]
*  Do we think this is going to work or could it actually elevate his opponents? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=75.9s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=80.6s)]
*  I think what's interesting here is this is kind of that typical playbook that we've seen [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=82.4s)]
*  over and over by the former president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=86.84s)]
*  He likes to go on the offensive, as you said. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=89.02000000000001s)]
*  He likes to give people nicknames, kind of punch down at them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  I think the big question is, does this work, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=95.4s)]
*  Is he able to kind of, with his base, get them galvanized against a DeSantis potential [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=99.92s)]
*  run? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  DeSantis is making DeSantis as his foil right now, most often on the campaign trail. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=107.2s)]
*  Yes, he's mentioning Mike Pence. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=113.12s)]
*  Yes, he has to mention his other Republicans. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=114.56s)]
*  But DeSantis is the Republican who a lot of folks I talk to say, is Trump without the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  baggage? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  The question is going to be when and if DeSantis takes the bait. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  So far, he has not officially announced. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  He's on his book tour. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=131.72s)]
*  How does he punch back and how does the former president deal with that is going to be something [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=134.04s)]
*  that we're going to continue to watch through the early days of this 2024 cycle. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  So the DeSantis comment about Ukraine is fascinating. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=143.56s)]
*  First of all, that kind of actually moves him in line with where Trump is and different [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  from much of the Republican Party, including some potential candidates like Mike Pompeo [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=151.18s)]
*  or Mike Pence, who have actually stroked, who have criticized Biden's administration [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=155.16s)]
*  for not doing enough to help Ukraine. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  This is DeSantis saying that the U.S. shouldn't be involved in a, quote, territorial dispute, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=162.16s)]
*  seemingly missing the fact that Russia invaded Ukraine's territory. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=167.68s)]
*  My question to you is if these two very, very loud voices, Trump and DeSantis, influential [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=171.6s)]
*  voices on the right are saying this, could that push Republican lawmakers on the Hill [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=175.76s)]
*  to start cutting off funding to Ukraine? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=181.04s)]
*  We've already started to see this thread of Republicans who are much more populous, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=183.8s)]
*  particularly in the House, questioning the U.S., cutting checks and continuing to cut [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=191.04s)]
*  checks for Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=197.96s)]
*  This is going to be a massive, massive issue and a big problem for President Joe Biden [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=199.88s)]
*  and certainly Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=204.96s)]
*  McCarthy has already been invited to go to Ukraine and speak with the president, so far [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=207.08s)]
*  has said he's not doing that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  I think that's one thing to watch. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=213.52s)]
*  This is going to be another issue that Republicans are going to have to deal with here in Washington [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=215.26s)]
*  and this idea that how they're going to figure out to convince these Republicans that funding [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=221.38s)]
*  is continuing to be needed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  But basically, DeSantis is giving a larger voice to some of the voices that we've already [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=228.14s)]
*  started to hear within the Republican Party of questioning this continuing to write billions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=233.5s)]
*  and billions of dollars for this to help fund this Ukraine effort. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=240.66s)]
*  And lastly, and briefly, President Biden, of course, unveiled his own budget a few days [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=244.38s)]
*  ago. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=248.66s)]
*  We've been waiting for House Speaker McCarthy to do the same. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=249.66s)]
*  The president says he's willing to meet with him at any time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  Have we gotten any sense as to when McCarthy will do so? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  It's still going to be several weeks off here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=258.18s)]
*  They're going to be putting it out in a few weeks. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  I think the big question is really, obviously, all of this, these are just kind of policy [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=263.98s)]
*  documents, talking points for the parties. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=268.78s)]
*  But I will say the big thing that matters here is the debt limit, which is going to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  come into focus very quickly here in May, June. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=274.7s)]
*  And so these are the kind of the early days of those negotiating positions. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=279.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=283.46s)]
*  A necessary opening act, to be sure. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=284.46s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer, thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RyaBZI44AQ&t=287.02s)]
