# Trump set to deliver joint address to Congress
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY)
*  President Trump is set to give a joint address to Congress tomorrow, where he's expected [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=0.0s)]
*  to tout what he believes are his early second-term successes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=4.68s)]
*  According to two sources, Trump circulated his speech among top advisers this weekend, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=8.36s)]
*  along with taking part in some prep. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=12.56s)]
*  The president is expected to focus on his administration's work on immigration, elimination, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=14.76s)]
*  eliminating diversity inclusion programs, tariffs and budget cuts executed by Doge during [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=19.12s)]
*  his address. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=24.88s)]
*  After the speech, Trump is set to stay in Washington and amplify his message from the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=25.96s)]
*  White House, rather than travel the country, as is typical after a joint address. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=29.82s)]
*  Vice President J.D. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=34.02s)]
*  Vance, however, is expected to take his place to highlight the administration's message [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=35.02s)]
*  on the road. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=39.18s)]
*  Joining us now, White House correspondent for The Hill, Alex Gangitano. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  Alex, talk a little bit about what we're expecting from this address. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=43.58s)]
*  We just laid out some of the obvious highlights, but what else? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=47.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think he'll be touting just a lot of the accomplishments. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=50.3s)]
*  I mean, we've heard them say time and time again that this last month was the most successful [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=52.78s)]
*  in presidential history for a first return to the White House in this case. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=58.06s)]
*  But I think it's going to be a lot of patting themselves on the back for things like these [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=64.26s)]
*  mass deportation plans. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=68.18s)]
*  You mentioned immigration is going to be a focus of this ending D.I. policies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=69.42s)]
*  That's such a big talking messaging point for Republicans. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=73.66s)]
*  But I also think a lot is going to be about Doge because this is something the president [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  has defended. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=80.58s)]
*  He's proud of he brought Elon Musk into his cabinet meeting last week. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=82.06s)]
*  I think he wants to talk about it and he also wants to kind of defend it in the sense of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=86.7s)]
*  there are some members of Congress who are skeptical about these cuts, about some of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=90.94s)]
*  their constituents losing jobs, about where the money from these cuts are going to go. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=95.34s)]
*  Is it going to go back to taxpayers? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=99.9s)]
*  It's going to go to the deficit. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=101.26s)]
*  I think he has to answer some of those questions. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=102.7s)]
*  And then, of course, it goes without saying, I think there'll be some fireworks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=104.54s)]
*  I think there'll be some big announcements. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=107.26s)]
*  I mean, he hasn't not made news in any of these big moments in the last six weeks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=108.7s)]
*  Yeah, and tariffs certainly expected to be among those potential announcements as we [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=113.58s)]
*  wait to see what he does in regards to China's already existing tariffs, but then also in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=117.74s)]
*  regards to Canada and Mexico. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=122.54s)]
*  But I think with Trump, when we talk about trumpeting of achievements, it doesn't seem [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=124.94s)]
*  like this is going to be a speech that even tries to play the unity card, which Trump [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=128.94s)]
*  has tried to play in the past. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=133.26s)]
*  And even we saw it on display during the inauguration. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=134.46s)]
*  Sure, the initial remarks might have extended some kind of an olive branch, but then he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=137.02s)]
*  made very divisive and controversial remarks minutes later downstairs in a different part [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=141.1s)]
*  of the Capitol. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=146.06s)]
*  So it seems like they're maybe not even trying this time. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=146.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  I don't think there'll be any part of this remarks that has Hakeem Jeffries leaving the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=149.42s)]
*  room saying, I want to help prevent a government shutdown with these folks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=153.9s)]
*  Now, I think it's going to be a lot of Republicans are leading the way. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=157.34s)]
*  We're doing all the right things and we're taking on these culture wars. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  And I think that's something that's going to frustrate a lot of Democrats is the idea [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=164.22s)]
*  that these culture wars are what Republicans care about the most. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=167.74s)]
*  Whereas they're trying to figure out ways that they could work with Republicans in a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=172.62s)]
*  bipartisan way. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=176.38s)]
*  We're also going to probably hear him, you know, take some jabs at former President Biden, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  things like that, that the president loves doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  That's just not messages of unity. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=184.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=187.34s)]
*  The other question I have is why is he not taking the show on the road? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=187.82000000000002s)]
*  This is a guy who loves to be in that rally environment, arguably sometimes more than he [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  enjoys his time in the Oval Office. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  At least that was true, seemingly, in the first term. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=196.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's something we've been wondering for weeks. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=199.02s)]
*  I mean, his supporters love seeing him, as you mentioned, you know, at these rallies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=200.7s)]
*  That's where he shines. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=204.38s)]
*  That's where his people want to see him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=205.66s)]
*  And he's been between the White House and Florida back and forth. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=207.9s)]
*  And so he really hasn't had these campaign style rallies that he loved doing in his first [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=211.9s)]
*  term when he was the sitting president and not necessarily campaign the whole time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=217.02s)]
*  You know, it is a tradition, like you said, to go on the road. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=221.74s)]
*  But he really has been keeping this cadence of I'm in Washington, I'm working hard, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=225.42s)]
*  I'm talking to the press every day from the Oval Office as I sign executive orders. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=229.82s)]
*  And I guess he wants to keep that balance. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=234.54s)]
*  We'll see if in the summer he decides to hit the road. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=236.22s)]
*  Letting JD Vance be the messenger on the road, at least for now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=239.26s)]
*  I know that the speech is likely to be domestically focused and yet so much happening on the world [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=242.7s)]
*  stage. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  What do you think the way that he talks about Ukraine and Russia? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=248.38s)]
*  How do you think that manifests? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=251.82s)]
*  I imagine that's going to be a flashpoint. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=253.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  After that explosive meeting on Friday with Ukrainian President Zelensky, I think there'll be [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=255.89999999999998s)]
*  a lot of also him saying, I put America first. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  I made Republicans who have been skeptical about Ukraine funding under the Biden administration [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=263.42s)]
*  happy by questioning Zelensky. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=269.02s)]
*  And if he was thankful enough, I actually think it's going to be a rallying point for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  him with Republicans. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=274.38s)]
*  Yeah, it very likely could be with Republicans. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=275.58s)]
*  Although as we started the show, there are some Republicans willing to say this is not [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=277.9s)]
*  the way that we should talk about our friends and our allies, especially not Ukraine. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=281.98s)]
*  We will see all eyes on where that relationship goes next. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=286.22s)]
*  White House correspondent for The Hill, Alex Gaggitano. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=288.94s)]
*  Thank you, as always. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzK3SDp6saY&t=291.26s)]
