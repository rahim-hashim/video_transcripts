# Trump scrambles to find lawyer ahead of first federal court appearance: WaPo
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE)
*  Joining us now, Congressional Investigations reporter for the Washington Post, our friend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=0.0s)]
*  Jackie Alameda. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=5.22s)]
*  She is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=6.22s)]
*  Good morning, Jackie. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=8.38s)]
*  Thanks for being with us today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=9.38s)]
*  Good morning, John. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=10.38s)]
*  So, this afternoon is the indictment, but you've got some brand new reporting on what [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=11.38s)]
*  Trump spent yesterday doing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  What can you share with us? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=19.06s)]
*  Well, once again, the former president is on the search for a lawyer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=20.94s)]
*  There has been a remarkable amount of tumult and turnover on Trump's legal defense team. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=26.34s)]
*  He spent the afternoon interviewing prospective lawyers who are based in Florida and might [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=32.5s)]
*  join the team. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=38.46s)]
*  As now, this is obviously a Florida-based case, and the former president could use some [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=39.46s)]
*  legal advice from someone in the state who has relevant experience and understands the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=44.5s)]
*  court. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=50.06s)]
*  A number of lawyers that we spoke to and legal experts said that any good counsel, that being [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=51.06s)]
*  Todd Blanch, who has taken the helm of Trump's defense team, would know that they would have [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=56.08s)]
*  to have a very solid in-state lawyer. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=60.0s)]
*  That being said, they have yet to find anyone or at least publicly announce who's going [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=64.04s)]
*  to sign on. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=68.26s)]
*  So, that means today Christopher Keiss, a veteran Florida litigator who is on Trump's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=69.26s)]
*  team but was sort of alienated when he first joined the team last year due to disagreements [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=74.08s)]
*  over legal strategy, are going to be appearing with Trump. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=79.64s)]
*  That doesn't mean that there aren't any offers that are outstanding. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=84.56s)]
*  We know a number of people who have been interviewed yet per usual. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=88.44s)]
*  There are a number of prominent Florida attorneys who have turned Trump down in the opportunity [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=92.58000000000001s)]
*  to represent him. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=97.64s)]
*  It has always been a challenge for Trump to retain good legal counsel, at least for a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  long time. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=103.56s)]
*  Their reputation was he wasn't really paying them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=104.56s)]
*  But Jackie, let's talk about his legal team, and your reporting highlights some of the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  tactics that we can expect from his defense team once it is put in place. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=110.48s)]
*  What are some of the theories that they're going to present here in the weeks ahead? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, so more broadly speaking, John, if you take a step back, there is a division on the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=120.92s)]
*  team and something that has hindered the hiring over the legal strategy that the defense team [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=127.72s)]
*  wants to take going forward. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  There is the camp that wants to assume that posture that Garrett just highlighted, which [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=133.94s)]
*  is the DOJ is weaponized, sort of a burn the house down strategy and to attack the DOJ [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  for alleged prosecutorial misconduct. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=146.28s)]
*  And then there's another half of the team who wants to take a more traditional approach, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=149.12s)]
*  actually hire good, solid trial attorneys and make sure that they focus a lot on the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=153.48s)]
*  juror selection. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=160.68s)]
*  It only takes one juror to win a case, especially in a potentially sympathetic courtroom in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=161.68s)]
*  West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=167.39999999999998s)]
*  That being said, there are a number of decisions that Todd Blanch is going to have to make [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  quickly under Eileen Cannon, some strategic tactics to potentially delay the trial, potentially [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=173.14s)]
*  efforts to try to get some of the information and the evidence that was included, particularly [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=181.1s)]
*  the evidence provided by Evan Corcoran rescinded. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  So there are a number of potential legal battles that the Trump team could line up going into this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=192.72s)]
*  And it certainly can't be overstated that while Judge Cannon won't be part of today's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=199.02s)]
*  proceedings, the role that she could play is significant once we head to trial. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  Congressional Investigation reporter for the Washington Post, Jackie Alamante, you've got [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=208.34s)]
*  a busy day ahead. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=211.46s)]
*  Thank you for starting it with us and we'll talk to you again soon. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUAQ1pRjWE&t=212.46s)]
