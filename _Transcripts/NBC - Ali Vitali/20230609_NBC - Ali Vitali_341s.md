# Decision to indict Trump in Florida could carry significant implications: NYT
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk)
*  Welcome back. Former federal prosecutors described the decision to charge former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump in Miami as strategic. The New York Times is highlighting how [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=5.64s)]
*  moving the case to Trump's home state of Florida, which has become a red state in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  recent cycles, lessens the likelihood that Trump will claim he can't get a [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=14.84s)]
*  fair trial due to political bias. The newspaper points out that the jury pool [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=18.88s)]
*  in Miami and around nearby Mar-a-Lago, that's in Palm Beach, is likely more [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=23.44s)]
*  diverse in political ideologies than a pool that would come from Washington, D.C. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=28.64s)]
*  And a dispute over Venue would have likely triggered a protected legal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=33.2s)]
*  battle, so DOJ is hoping to avoid that. Joining us now, someone very familiar [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=37.52s)]
*  with the jury pools of South Florida, state attorney for Palm Beach County, Dave [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=42.64s)]
*  Arenberg. Dave, great to see you. We're gonna talk about Venue in a second, but [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  first let's just talk about the charges themselves, your take, and explain [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=51.0s)]
*  to the viewer, is it matter or not if Trump, we know he has, he's being charged [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=56.64s)]
*  with having this classified material, does it matter or not if he showed it to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=61.68s)]
*  anybody? Good morning, Jonathan. Well, the dissemination of classified material [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=65.08s)]
*  would come under the Espionage Act, and he's gonna be charged under the Espionage [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=70.6s)]
*  Act, 18 USC 793E, and that can get you up to 10 years in prison. And there's two [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=73.84s)]
*  parts to it, disseminating it, showing it to people, or just not returning it upon [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  request. And that's an important charge here, but the most serious charge is the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=84.48s)]
*  obstruction. That'll get you up to 20 years in prison. And then there's a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=88.84s)]
*  conspiracy count apparently involved here. And Jonathan, that to me is the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  biggest question. Conspiracy means there's an agreement between two or more [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  people to commit a crime. Well, who's the other person or other persons involved? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=99.4s)]
*  Because it could be, is it Mark Meadows? Is it Walt Nata, the valet, who, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  according to reports, was told to move the documents before the feds got there? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=110.04s)]
*  So we're still gonna see a lot more coming, especially if it's a speaking [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=114.08s)]
*  indictment by the feds, which will set out the facts of what happened. And we [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=118.2s)]
*  should learn all of that on Tuesday, of course, in Miami. So let's talk about [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Florida and this idea of venue change. You know, up to this point, up until [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=126.6s)]
*  about a week ago, we were all so solely focused on Washington, D. C. When it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=130.44s)]
*  came to a grand jury, when it came to D. O. J.'s probe there about the former [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=134.35999999999999s)]
*  president, January six. Yes, but also the classified documents part. And then [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=139.32s)]
*  suddenly we learned of this Miami grand jury, and that is where chargers are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=142.48s)]
*  brought. So talk to us about that decision and what you make of what that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=146.88s)]
*  venue could mean going forward. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=150.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, the D. O. J. Can keep a secret. Jonathan, none of us knew about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  this grand jury. They certainly didn't tell us state prosecutors about it, and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=156.72s)]
*  they did this in secret. And here we are now. Prosecutors clearly would rather [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=160.6s)]
*  have this case in Washington, D. C. Rather than down here in south Florida, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  you know, Washington, D. C. They voted 90 or 92% for Joe Biden to 5% for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=168.44s)]
*  Donald Trump in 2020 in Palm Beach County. They voted 43% for Donald Trump [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=174.32s)]
*  and in Miami Dade County, they voted 46% for Donald Trump. So you can see why [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=181.04s)]
*  the jury pool is better for prosecutors in D. C. But there are two reasons why [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=184.96s)]
*  this case is in the southern district of Florida. First, prosecutors have to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=189.4s)]
*  bring charges against defendants in the jurisdiction where the crime took place. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=193.28s)]
*  It looks like the obstruction clearly took place at Mar-a-Lago in the southern [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=197.4s)]
*  district of Florida, as well as the espionage and filing in south Florida [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=201.4s)]
*  eliminates Trump's inevitable venue challenges in court. As you pointed out, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=205.16s)]
*  that could have undone the case before it ever got started. At the very least, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=209.12s)]
*  it would have delayed the case. And also there's a second reason, Jonathan. I [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=212.76s)]
*  think it's because Jack Smith wanted the public to buy into this. He's a career [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=216.44s)]
*  prosecutor appointed by an apolitical former judge who's now the attorney [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=220.48s)]
*  general. And I'm sure he bristles at accusations that this is a political [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=224.88s)]
*  witch hunt. And to show this is not political, he wanted to go into a red [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=228.36s)]
*  state, Donald Trump's home state, and get indictment. It's a bit of a gangster [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=232.32s)]
*  move. It's gonna be harder to get a conviction, but not impossible. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=236.16s)]
*  So Dave, let's talk briefly about Trump's possible defenses. He's been [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=240.32s)]
*  floating of various explanations on truth social over the months. But when [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=244.76s)]
*  they're in that courtroom, what do you think his teams will say and how [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=249.44s)]
*  effective might they be? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=253.0s)]
*  I think he's gonna lean into the fact that as president, he has wide latitude [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=255.16s)]
*  to declassify documents. And that's why prosecutors seem to work really hard [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=259.16s)]
*  to debunk that declassification defense. And if it's true, they have this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=263.44s)]
*  recording of Donald Trump on tape, admitting that he knows about the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=269.04s)]
*  declassification rules and that this is not just some Jedi mind trick that he [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=272.32s)]
*  created where he can just declassify things in his mind or has a standing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=277.0s)]
*  order to declassify things, then that's gonna hurt Donald Trump. And I think [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=280.6s)]
*  that's what prosecutors are waiting on. That was the final piece of the puzzle. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=284.0s)]
*  And then there's also the chance that Donald Trump could count on what's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=288.16s)]
*  called jury nullification, hoping you get a couple of Trump supporters on the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=291.08s)]
*  jury who just won't want to send their guy into the who's gal. And, you know, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=295.76s)]
*  if you think about it, if he's being tried in Miami Dade County, where 46% of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=300.6s)]
*  the voters went for Trump, that's 5.5 out of 12 jurors on the panel that are [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=305.16s)]
*  Trump voters. So Trump is probably thinking he likes his odds there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=310.24s)]
*  The right man to talk about legal proceedings in South Florida State [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=314.16s)]
*  Attorney for Palm Beach County Dave Aaron Berg. Thank you so much for [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=317.28s)]
*  joining us today. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMz3yVAmWqk&t=320.08s)]
