# Colorado trial tests if 14th Amendment can keep Trump off 2024 ballot
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw)
*  whether former President Trump's actions on January 6th are grounds to keep him [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=0.0s)]
*  off the 2024 ballot. The lawsuit argues that Trump is not eligible to appear on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=5.24s)]
*  the state's presidential ballot under the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=10.72s)]
*  which bars anyone who swore under oath to defend the presidential ballot on [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=15.16s)]
*  quote engaged in insurrectional rebellion from holding office. The first [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=20.04s)]
*  day of testimony yesterday saw several police officers take the stand to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=25.84s)]
*  recount their experiences on January 6th. Congressman Eric Swalwell also [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=30.36s)]
*  testified remotely about what lawmakers experienced that day. Colorado is not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=35.32s)]
*  the only state testing the Civil War era legal theory. NBC News reports that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  arguments before the Minnesota Supreme Court in a lawsuit to boot him off the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  ballot in that state, which also cites the little known provision in the 14th [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=49.44s)]
*  Amendment are set to begin Thursday. Similar legal challenges are underway [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=53.84s)]
*  in New Hampshire, Arizona and Michigan. Trump's legal team originally tried to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  have the Colorado suit thrown out, but his campaign is now fundraising off it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. Great [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=67.76s)]
*  to see you, John. So let's just talk about the this lawsuit, not the legality [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=73.48s)]
*  of it per se, but the political ramifications. I know there are some [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=77.72s)]
*  Democrats who have expressed wariness to me that this idea is playing right into [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=82.92s)]
*  Trump's hands. That this is a little known provision. It's unclear if it's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  even legal trying to keep him off the ballot sort of reinforces the idea that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=91.28s)]
*  this whole thing, including his legal cases, are all just a deep state [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=96.28s)]
*  conspiracy to defeat him. What's your take? Yeah, well, I mean, there's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=99.8s)]
*  certainly Democrats that believe that there's some split within the party, but [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=104.08s)]
*  I think for most Democrats, I'd like to be able to beat Donald Trump at the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  ballot box in 2024. So setting aside just for a second, you know, that sort [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=112.52s)]
*  of that question of, you know, the politics of it and whether it helps [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump. He's fundraising, as you point out, ever since he started being [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  indicted. Since these lawsuits about the 14th Amendment started coming up, you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=128.6s)]
*  know, he's been taking off within the Republican primary. Just setting that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=133.8s)]
*  aside for a moment. There are also a lot of Democrats who believe that unless [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=137.76s)]
*  he was actually convicted of engaging in a rebellion or an insurrection, that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=141.4s)]
*  that 14th Amendment clause should not be triggered. So let's talk about the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=146.08s)]
*  2024 landscape, John. Vice President Pence bowed out this weekend. He was [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  campaign had financial issues. It's not stunning, perhaps, that he had to make [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=156.24s)]
*  this decision that people didn't expect in Las Vegas. But just talk chart. Talk [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=161.68s)]
*  to us about his path about someone who so loyally served Donald Trump right [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=165.4s)]
*  to the end until January 6th. He broke with Trump then he defended the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=170.12s)]
*  Constitution. And since then, he's made his campaign about explaining why he [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=173.28s)]
*  did so. But what a fall from grace that someone who was the vice president of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=177.72000000000003s)]
*  the United States didn't even get close to making it to Iowa. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=181.44s)]
*  Yeah, it made him a pariah within the Republican Party to certify the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=185.88000000000002s)]
*  election results of 2020 while Donald Trump was railing against them. And [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  there is obviously a small segment of the Republican Party. When I say a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  small segment, I mean an infinitesimal segment of the Republican Party that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=201.44s)]
*  looked at what Mike Pence did and said, Not only did he do the right thing, but [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=205.28s)]
*  that's my guy. That's who I want in there with all these choices between [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=209.2s)]
*  Donald Trump, who actually, you know, fomented outrage about the 2020 [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=213.84s)]
*  election, attempted to overturn the 2020 election, stood, you know, in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Washington, D. C. And told people to march the capital between him and then [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  the set of Republicans who are on some spectrum between that and actually [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=227.0s)]
*  thinking the 2020 election was decided fairly. Mike Pence ends up not even [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=230.68s)]
*  having the money or or the support to get to Iowa. And speaking of Iowa, we [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=236.44s)]
*  had a new Des Moines Register poll out yesterday. Some buzz about Nikki Haley [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=241.56s)]
*  catching Ron DeSantis. She's now tied for for second in a state that DeSantis [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=246.56s)]
*  had placed all his chips on. But react to that, if you will, but also tell us [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=250.6s)]
*  what my think is the real takeaway here is that Trump is in a state that he's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=255.6s)]
*  never been particularly popular as a 30 plus point lead and also that he's the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=258.84s)]
*  second choice candidate for so many of the others. So let's say if DeSantis [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=263.08s)]
*  were to drop out, most of his supporters wouldn't go to Haley but to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=267.44s)]
*  Trump. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's about 40% of the DeSantis supporters [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=270.64s)]
*  end up going to Trump if DeSantis were to drop out, which is, by the way, the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=275.6s)]
*  argument that DeSantis people have been making. They're basically saying, Look, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=279.28s)]
*  if DeSantis drops out, Trump wins. If Haley drops out, a much lower percentage [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=282.4s)]
*  of hers, I think it's 12%, would go to Trump. Most of them would go to DeSantis. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=288.2s)]
*  So that's a big argument for DeSantis in terms of trying to say that he should be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=292.08s)]
*  the nominee. Of course, the thing that's working against him is that his [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=295.84s)]
*  trajectory has been nothing but downward since he got in, where you've [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=298.67999999999995s)]
*  seen Haley as you've seen Haley build slowly over time and a very upward if [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=301.84s)]
*  slow trajectory from being virtually unsupported to being in a place where [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=307.04s)]
*  she's tied for second in Iowa. You see her having moved in New Hampshire and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  obviously South Carolina, her home state is a place where she would be expected [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=317.12s)]
*  to do well. And then, John, we're about a week away from the next Republican [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=321.16s)]
*  debate. Trump, of course, skipping it again. Tell us who you think. Give us a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=325.0s)]
*  candidate or two who you believe it's a make or break moment. I think it's a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=328.88s)]
*  make or break moment for Ron DeSantis right now, John. I mean, he has been [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=333.32s)]
*  losing altitude not just in polling, but also in terms of donors, some who have [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  stopped giving to him, some who have started giving back to Donald Trump as [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=341.44s)]
*  NBC has recently reported. You know, I'm not saying he needs to have a breakout [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=345.48s)]
*  moment, but now you're gonna see him match more closely against Nikki Haley. I [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=349.32s)]
*  expect to see the two of them go after each other a little bit. They're just in, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=353.92s)]
*  you know, they're jockeying for that position. And if DeSantis doesn't come [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=357.84s)]
*  off better than Haley for a third straight debate, you know, you could see [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  him start to lose even more support. Yeah, and this one happening in his home [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=366.0s)]
*  state of Florida. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvSklupMthw&t=369.12s)]
