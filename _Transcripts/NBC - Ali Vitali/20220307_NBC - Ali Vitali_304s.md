# 'It's So Painful': Kharkiv Resident, Now In Poland, Details Fleeing Ukraine
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg)
*  So, Alison, you're at a refugee center there in Poland and encountering Ukrainians fleeing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=0.0s)]
*  the situation at home. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=6.12s)]
*  What are they telling you about what they're leaving behind? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=8.0s)]
*  Yeah, if I can, I want to just let you hear what we are hearing live in real time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=11.4s)]
*  We have our translator, Yvonne, with us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=17.88s)]
*  I was talking to Oksana. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=19.72s)]
*  She arrived here not long ago from Kharkiv. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=21.5s)]
*  That is one of the hardest hit areas in eastern Ukraine. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=24.88s)]
*  Oksana, you were telling us that just a few days ago you were making a costume for Goran [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=28.56s)]
*  for his school play on March 8th, and now you're here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=34.76s)]
*  Yes, my children were going to kindergarten. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=40.16s)]
*  They were six and two years old. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=44.28s)]
*  They were going to kindergarten. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=45.96s)]
*  We were preparing for 8th of March. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=47.92s)]
*  We were living our life. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=50.08s)]
*  And look at us now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=52.96s)]
*  We've been not sleeping for two days. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=55.84s)]
*  We're living this terrible life because someone decided that my children should not have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  home anymore. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=65.64s)]
*  We just put everything we had in our bag, but the rest of the clothes we left in Ukraine, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=69.12s)]
*  our city is destroyed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=75.48s)]
*  We don't have it anymore. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  Our Kharkiv is destroyed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=79.48s)]
*  Some residential areas are still standing, but there are many of them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=82.2s)]
*  My children are sitting on the ground. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=87.28s)]
*  Just look at it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  We came from another country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Is this your first time here? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Yes, it's my first time abroad, actually. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=96.2s)]
*  Do you have any family, friends, places to stay? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=101.72s)]
*  No, no one. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=104.72s)]
*  Some strangers are helping us. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=108.72s)]
*  Some volunteers are helping us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=111.72s)]
*  We are hosted by strangers who don't even know us, but they did help. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=113.72s)]
*  Look around. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=118.72s)]
*  Everybody is helping us. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=119.72s)]
*  They're giving us food. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=121.72s)]
*  They're giving us towels. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=122.72s)]
*  They're giving us clothes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=123.72s)]
*  We could actually sleep outside yesterday. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=126.72s)]
*  It was a total coincidence that we were taken to someone's house. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=131.72s)]
*  After we crossed the border, we really had high chances to sleep outside, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=135.72s)]
*  but some kind people for free gave us shelter. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=140.72s)]
*  So we're so thankful to Poland for hosting us, for making it all possible. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=144.72s)]
*  How hard has this been for your children? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=150.72s)]
*  Their dad is back in Ukraine. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=153.72s)]
*  For my children, it's very difficult. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=156.72s)]
*  They want to sleep. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=159.72s)]
*  They want warm milk. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=161.72s)]
*  Instead of that, they drink cold water. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=163.72s)]
*  In Kharkiv, we left our father in Kharkiv. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=166.72s)]
*  Many children are still in Kharkiv. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=170.72s)]
*  Who needs it? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=173.72s)]
*  No one needs it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=174.72s)]
*  Who wants it? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=175.72s)]
*  Also, no one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=176.72s)]
*  Who wants? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=177.72s)]
*  What kind of parents would want their children to live on the streets? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=180.72s)]
*  We don't even know when we will see our father. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=185.72s)]
*  It's so painful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=188.72s)]
*  I can't. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=190.72s)]
*  I can't bear it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=191.72s)]
*  It's so difficult. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=192.72s)]
*  These are children they need to sleep. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=194.72s)]
*  They need to be washed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=196.72s)]
*  They need to do everything that they normally do. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=198.72s)]
*  But instead, they're sleeping in corridors. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=201.72s)]
*  Yeah, so back in Kharkiv, they were sleeping in corridors, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=207.72s)]
*  and we had no guarantee that those bombs by Russia would not be thrown on my children. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=209.72s)]
*  We used to live in a private house there in Kharkiv. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=215.72s)]
*  And around us, there were more private houses with children. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=218.72s)]
*  These same children as mine. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=221.72s)]
*  We don't have any strategic military objects there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=223.72s)]
*  No one needs it to get it done. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=226.72s)]
*  Thank you for speaking with us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=229.72s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you for giving us the time to let them tell their stories, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=231.72s)]
*  because this is what for days we hear again and again. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=236.72s)]
*  We are meeting children who are scared at times. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=240.72s)]
*  They think this is a fun trip. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=242.72s)]
*  She talked about her oldest son. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=244.72s)]
*  When the bombs were falling, he thought it was a game. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=246.72s)]
*  He didn't understand what was happening. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=249.72s)]
*  She hoped she'd praise her youngest son, will never remember this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=251.72s)]
*  This is one family story. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=255.72s)]
*  1.5 million people have fled Ukraine so far. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=257.72s)]
*  This is one of countless similar stories. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=262.72s)]
*  Every person we speak to, they want their children to be safe. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=265.72s)]
*  They want to go home, and they want this war to end. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=268.72s)]
*  Jonathan? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=273.72s)]
*  Thank you for bringing that story to us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=274.72s)]
*  That was obviously very emotional and heartbreaking. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=276.72s)]
*  Alison Barber and Molly Hunter, both from NBC, thank you so much. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gMIGvZqAg&t=279.72s)]
