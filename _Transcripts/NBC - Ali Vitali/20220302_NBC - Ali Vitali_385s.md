# Biden Stressed Importance Of Democracies Over Autocracies: White House
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw)
*  Our forces are not going to Europe to fight Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=0.0s)]
*  the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  For that purpose, we have mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=9.6s)]
*  to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=14.96s)]
*  And as I've made crystal clear, the United States and our allies will defend every inch [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  of our relationship territory that is NATO territory with a full force of our collective [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=26.74s)]
*  power, every single inch. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=30.74s)]
*  That was President Biden last night vying to stand with America's NATO allies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=32.739999999999995s)]
*  Joining us now, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=39.739999999999995s)]
*  Jen, not much sleep to be had last night. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=42.94s)]
*  We appreciate you being here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=44.64s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=46.26s)]
*  Lots of adrenaline and coffee, Jonathan. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=47.26s)]
*  You know how it goes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=50.26s)]
*  That's how I run every day. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  Let's start with where the president made the centerpiece of the speech, the war in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  Eastern Europe. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Give us just an update as to where things stand, particularly this Russian convoy that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=59.06s)]
*  is very slowly moving its way towards Kiev. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=64.14s)]
*  What do we think happens with that and what more can America do to help? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=67.7s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, I think what we've seen over the last couple of days is just incredible [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  bravery and courage from Ukrainian leadership, from the Ukrainian people in fighting back [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=76.98s)]
*  against the Russian military and the ambitions of President Putin. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=82.34s)]
*  But President Putin's ambitions have not changed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=85.74s)]
*  So he is continuing and the Russian military is continuing to move towards Kiev. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=88.28s)]
*  They have every intention and every ambition of taking Kiev and continuing to take control [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=92.22s)]
*  over Ukraine. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  That is why over the last couple of days, you've seen the president not only amp up [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=98.3s)]
*  humanitarian assistance, but also increased security assistance. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  He approved a major package over the weekend and we're expediting delivery of that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  So it is absolutely true, as that clip just showed, that NATO is united, that President [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=110.82s)]
*  Putin underestimated NATO being united, the West being united, even the United States [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  being united. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  But we have to be clear-eyed about what President Putin's ambitions are and what he's continuing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  to walk toward here or walk toward with his military, I should say. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=125.58s)]
*  Yeah, certainly the you got the White House and allies across the West have unleashed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=129.22s)]
*  a pummeling array of sanctions against Russia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=134.54s)]
*  But you still have a card to play in sort of energy and gas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=137.98s)]
*  Will there be moves there to sanction that key industry in Russia as well? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, we're very open. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  I think you've seen, Jonathan, I know you cover this and follow this very, very closely. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=148.74s)]
*  Almost every single day, there's new sanctions and new steps that we're taking and announcing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=153.26s)]
*  with our Western partners or countries in Europe. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=158.42s)]
*  And we're doing that in lockstep and in a unified way, which is very important to the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=161.62s)]
*  president. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=166.26s)]
*  But we also factor in or what he looks at, and I think this is important for people to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  know, is how we can maximize the impact and the squeeze on President Putin and the financial [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=170.66s)]
*  sector. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=176.7s)]
*  We're already seeing that, you know, the ruble, their currency is plummeting. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=177.7s)]
*  We're seeing the stock market plummet there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=181.62s)]
*  Inflation is skyrocketing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=184.34s)]
*  But we want to minimize the impact on the global marketplace. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=185.34s)]
*  And that includes the global oil marketplace and the impact of energy prices for the American [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=194.5s)]
*  So that's one of the factors that we really look at. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=195.74s)]
*  We're considering it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=198.46s)]
*  It's very much on the table. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=199.46s)]
*  But we need to weigh what all of the impacts will be. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=201.46s)]
*  We're not trying to hurt ourselves. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=203.54s)]
*  We're trying to hurt President Putin and the Russian economy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=204.82s)]
*  Pivoting to the president's domestic agenda, the State of the Union, as you well know, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=208.62s)]
*  is his largest stage. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=213.54s)]
*  He'll likely have this year. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=214.78s)]
*  It's his bully pulpit to press forth what he wants to get done. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=216.1s)]
*  But he made not one mention last night of the January 6th insurrection. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=220.14s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=224.06s)]
*  Well, I think first that for anybody who watched the president's speech just over a month ago, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=226.06s)]
*  or maybe six weeks ago, you heard how passionately he felt about that day, that horrible day [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=232.62s)]
*  in history. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=238.82s)]
*  And what he has done since then is continue to talk about and stand up for democracy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=239.98s)]
*  What you heard the president talk about last night is the importance of democracies prevailing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=244.74s)]
*  over autocracies, of standing up and believing that that is what makes us strongest, being [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=249.18s)]
*  united in this country and being united abroad. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=254.3s)]
*  That is very much what the theme of his January 6th speech was just six weeks ago and how [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  he thinks we all should be thinking about this period in our own history. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=262.1s)]
*  So look, a speech like the State of the Union, it's hugely important. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't touch on, it doesn't have the time to touch on everything that is a priority. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  And there's no question that continuing to take steps to support the efforts to hold [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=274.64s)]
*  those perpetrators accountable is a priority for him. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=279.5s)]
*  And continuing to stand up as a leader of the United States for what that day really [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=282.5s)]
*  showcased, the need to stand up for democracies, will be something the American people keep [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  hearing from him. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=292.02s)]
*  Jen, one of the headlines that emerged from the speech last night was a pair of Republican [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=293.02s)]
*  House members who chose to heckle President Biden as he was speaking about his late son [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=297.5s)]
*  Bo. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=302.62s)]
*  Do you have any response to what they said? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=303.62s)]
*  Not really, Jonathan. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=304.62s)]
*  I have to tell you that during that heckling, which I was watching that on TV with a group [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=308.02s)]
*  of my team members and colleagues, and we were all excited and cheering, and that was [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=313.06s)]
*  the moment in the speech where the president was talking about his unity agenda and talking [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  about priorities that we should all be able to agree on. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=322.7s)]
*  Look, one American dies every five minutes of an opioid overdose. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  There's no question we should do more to help our nation's veterans, people who have been [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=330.74s)]
*  hurt by the impacts of burn pits. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  Of course, we need to do more to work together to cure cancer. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=337.44s)]
*  And they were heckling around that time and that moment. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=341.16s)]
*  I think that says a lot more about them than it does about how important these priorities [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=343.92s)]
*  are and how much the vast majority of people who were sitting there watching in that chamber [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=348.06s)]
*  last night could work together to solve exactly those problems and others too, probably. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=353.62s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, we really appreciate you being here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=359.4s)]
*  Please come back again soon. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=362.44s)]
*  My pleasure, Jonathan. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsys1HR_fbw&t=363.44s)]
