# Breaking Down DHS Talking Points That Were Sympathetic To Kyle Rittenhouse | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM)
*  An internal Department of Homeland Security document obtained by NBC News shows DHS officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=0.0s)]
*  were instructed to make sympathetic public comments about Kyle Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=6.24s)]
*  who was accused of fatally shooting two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, back in August. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  The DHS document is a list of media talking points about Rittenhouse, encouraging officials [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=17.84s)]
*  to say in part that he, quote, took his rifle to the scene of the rioting to help defend [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=23.04s)]
*  small business owners. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=28.38s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in NBC News correspondent Julia Ainsley, who broke this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=30.54s)]
*  story. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=35.379999999999995s)]
*  Julia, good morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=36.379999999999995s)]
*  This is pretty troubling. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=37.54s)]
*  What else were officials told to say about Rittenhouse? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=39.82s)]
*  Well, Casey, as you know, President Trump has been very sympathetic to Kyle Rittenhouse [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  coming out very much before we had many facts saying that he was someone who should be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=50.14s)]
*  supported. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=54.82s)]
*  Now, what these talking points show is that those same sympathetic ideas were being pushed [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=56.38s)]
*  to law enforcement officials, officials within DHS who we would expect to have more information [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=61.26s)]
*  before they go out and make statements like this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=66.54s)]
*  In addition to the talking point about him wanting to go and support small businesses, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=69.14s)]
*  they talk about how video evidence shows that he was being chased and how it looks like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=73.92s)]
*  this was a matter of self-defense. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=78.26s)]
*  They talk about how they should push back on media talking points that he was this police-subsessed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=80.36s)]
*  lone wolf, someone who didn't know what he was doing, that they should be pushing back [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=85.74s)]
*  against anything and really trying to speak favorably about him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=91.14s)]
*  It's interesting because at that point, we really didn't even have an investigation. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  Right now, Kyle Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple homicides. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=99.74s)]
*  His lawyers are arguing he was acting in self-defense. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=103.38s)]
*  But at this point, these talking points were going out in the immediate aftermath. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  As we know, law enforcement officials are usually very reticent to ever talk about an [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=111.14s)]
*  ongoing investigation, primarily one that they have nothing to do with, as DHS was. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=115.62s)]
*  DHS was, of course, trying to be involved in protests, to talk about how they were quelling [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=120.74s)]
*  civil unrest. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=126.1s)]
*  But in Kenosha, Wisconsin, particularly with the case of Kyle Rittenhouse, they didn't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=127.1s)]
*  have a role. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=131.4s)]
*  So the fact that these talking points were going out to DHS officials to talk about Kyle [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=132.4s)]
*  and the sympathetic and favorable light shows how lockstep the political talking points [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=137.98s)]
*  with the White House are with DHS, which traditionally should be a law enforcement organization. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  And when those officials come out and talk to the media, they should be standing on their [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  own intelligence and information. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  And if they don't have it, they usually stay back. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it seems like an extraordinary example of the politicization here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=161.17999999999998s)]
*  Do we know how these talking points were generated? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=166.46s)]
*  Was the White House directing them to do this? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=169.86s)]
*  As you point out, I can't tell you the number of times I've asked officials to comment on [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=174.06s)]
*  something like this and they come back and they say, well, we can't comment on an ongoing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  investigation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=181.3s)]
*  Yeah, of course, Casey, we've run into that all of the time, even if it's an investigation, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=182.3s)]
*  it's playing on court where we have more of the details. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=188.66s)]
*  They don't comment on it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=191.06s)]
*  So at this point, we don't know if these started at the White House or within DHS, but I would [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=192.5s)]
*  say just from speaking to people who have been on the receiving end of these, and this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=196.02s)]
*  administration and the Obama administration, even the Bush administration, they say it's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=200.18s)]
*  common to get political talking points from the White House on certain issues, but not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=204.10000000000002s)]
*  ongoing investigations. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=210.66000000000003s)]
*  And they say that these could have generated within DHS, but also that the press shops [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=212.82000000000002s)]
*  between the two talk very frequently. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of communication going on right now, and they don't put that usual red tape [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=220.22s)]
*  around those investigations that we would expect them to. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wx6kZqu3GM&t=225.5s)]
