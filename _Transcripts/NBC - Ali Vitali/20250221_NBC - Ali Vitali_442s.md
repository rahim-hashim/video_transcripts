# Musk jokes about DOGE's access to sensitive information, Bannon calls for third Trump term
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ)
*  The annual gathering of conservatives known as CPAC will pick up for day two later this morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=0.0s)]
*  after Elon Musk helped kick off the first day of the conference by swinging around a tricked out [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=4.88s)]
*  chainsaw. Yeah, no, you're actually hearing that. It's not just because it's early. Musk wielded the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=9.84s)]
*  chainsaw gifted to him by the president of Argentina as a symbol to promote cost cutting [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=14.16s)]
*  measures and slashing government spending. Bit on the nose. Musk spoke to the crowd about the work [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=18.8s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency is doing. He then joked about concerns regarding Dozier's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=24.72s)]
*  recent work at the Social Security Administration and the access they tried to get to sensitive [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=29.6s)]
*  information there. All right, listen, like if I steal some Social Security, I can finally buy [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=34.4s)]
*  nice things. Yeah. And on that same question, they're also talking about you guys are going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=40.08s)]
*  to end Social Security. You're going to end Medicare. You're going to end these things. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=49.36s)]
*  I don't imagine that conversation has been had with the president and that's the plan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=52.88s)]
*  No, in fact, the actions that we're taking with the support of the president and the support of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=57.12s)]
*  the agencies is what will save Medicare, what will save Social Security. If the country goes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=62.4s)]
*  insolvent, if all the money is just spent on paying interest on debt, there's no money left for anything. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=67.36s)]
*  I am become meme. Yeah, pretty much. I'm just living the meme. It's like there's living the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=76.8s)]
*  dream and there's living the meme and it's pretty much what's happening. You know, you're like, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=84.64s)]
*  I think you're, I mean, don't start it out as a meme. Think about it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=89.52s)]
*  Now it's real. Isn't that crazy? Isn't that crazy? Musk also spoke about Russia's war on Ukraine, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=94.88s)]
*  denying that he's a Russian asset while also calling for an end to the war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of people dead in trenches for what? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  And I'll tell you what for it. It's like for the biggest graph machine that I've ever seen in my [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=112.8s)]
*  life. That's for what? It's, it's unreal. Like the amount of money that is being taken in graph and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=116.72s)]
*  bribery is disgusting. Then after Musk's interview, Steve Bannon spoke to the crowd, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=125.04s)]
*  calling for Trump to have a third term as president. The future of America is MAGA. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=132.32s)]
*  Okay. In the future of MAGA is Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  We want Trump in 28. That's where they can't stand. A man like Trump comes along only once [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=147.84s)]
*  or twice in a country's history. Right? We want Trump. A lot to unpack. We'll do it with politics [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=154.72s)]
*  reporter for Semaphore, Dave Weigel, who was at CPAC yesterday. A lot of things that you could [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  choose from there. What stuck out to you? What was your key takeaway from day one? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=168.08s)]
*  Well, the overall theme, I think Bannon epitomized it there, is that the conservative movement, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=172.08s)]
*  the Republicans in Congress have handed their power over to Donald Trump and Elon Musk with very few [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=177.28s)]
*  conditions. There was one, there was one moment of, I'd say tension between Mike Johnson, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk on this idea, which, which came from a conservative tweeting it at Musk, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=188.0s)]
*  sending it to Susie Wiles of using Doge savings eventually if they get to two trillion for these [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  dividend checks. And Mike Johnson says, Oh, I'm not really into that on stage. I'm not really into [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=196.8s)]
*  that idea. This is the party of fiscal conservatism. We need to pay down the debt. Musk is asked about [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=201.84s)]
*  it and gets much bigger cheers for saying he wants to do the checks and Trump is on board. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  And Republicans are Republicans in Congress who were voting all night. They were not the stars [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=210.56s)]
*  of this conference. This is the, the Donald Trump and the people who are moving through the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=215.68s)]
*  government with questionable legal, legal ability to cut things that members of Congress said. They [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=220.32000000000002s)]
*  couldn't cut on their own. And the chainsaw, I think, however ridiculous is also an apt metaphor [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=226.72s)]
*  for the way that they are going about it. But even yesterday, as we were previewing CPAC, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=232.56s)]
*  our guest on the show said, you know, the Gipper must be looking down and saying, well, at least [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=237.6s)]
*  they've still got tax cuts. He did a far better impression. I'm not even going to try, but it [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=241.28s)]
*  really does show you the ways that this Republican party has seemingly abandoned a lot of the key [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=245.28s)]
*  principles that they for a long time were so centrally for. Yeah. It is a nationalist party. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=250.56s)]
*  Now they're used 10 years ago, you would have arguments at CPAC about immigration. Should we [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=256.08s)]
*  support immigration reform as conservatives? And that's over. It could be as Trump won [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=261.28s)]
*  any increase the share, the share of the non-white vote, the Hispanic vote. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  This is not usual for after an election for people to be overjoyed at a conference like this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=269.28s)]
*  But really the theme was bigger than Trump is exceeding. It was that Trump is exceeding [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=273.76s)]
*  at such a high degree that we can export this around the world. And you had CPAC has been, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=278.08s)]
*  Millay who gave the chainsaw has been at CPAC before two years ago. The idea, or I'd say a year [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=282.48s)]
*  ago, Millay was showing up and saying, what I'm doing in Argentina, very different fiscal situation, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=287.04s)]
*  very different government situation in the United States should be done here slash everything. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=291.76s)]
*  He's there passing the torch slash chainsaw to Musk, but other foreign conservative leaders, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  leaders of their parties who are not in power yet were there saying, we love Elon Musk. We want what [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=302.32s)]
*  Doge is doing to come to our country. We want the Trump immigration policy to come to our country. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=306.32s)]
*  There was an ovation for the mention of JD Vance's speech in Munich saying, yes, we want [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=310.88s)]
*  Americans to export their versions of free speech and their versions of at the moment, cost cutting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=315.68s)]
*  around the world. We want it not imperialism per se, because this is not Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  showing up and talking about war in Iraq. It's saying American power epitomized by Donald Trump [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  is what the entire world needs. You and I have attended many of these CPAC gatherings over the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=330.64s)]
*  years, and I think you and I have had a front seat to watch the way that CPAC has turned into [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=335.52s)]
*  TPAC to the point where the organizers have even called it that. But I wonder as we look ahead, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  there are some questions of, you know, is this the way to figure out who's next in the pipeline? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  But you hear ban in there. I mean, how seriously are people taking this idea of a third term? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=350.32s)]
*  They can't do it. But is it a troll or is it more than that? A lot of it is a troll. There are a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=355.12s)]
*  lot of things said at CPAC and in Republican politics that they know will get a rise out of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=361.52s)]
*  the media and will fix it. The media's attention for a day. Ben is very good at that. That's part [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=365.2s)]
*  of what he was doing. There was one group there that had a side room that was unofficial saying [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=368.96s)]
*  here's a Cesarean Trump third term project. But Vance is very popular in that room. There'll be [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  a straw poll over the weekend that's being conducted right now about who they want to be the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=379.12s)]
*  next nominee. Vance very quickly, more than Mike Pence ever did, has taken over the hearts and minds [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=382.32s)]
*  of people. But yes, what is the impact of several years of a vice president being [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  undermined by that by everyone saying we really don't want to have to put up with you? George [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=394.64s)]
*  H.W. Bush, I guess, dealt with it with Albregon. But I think it is a combination of this drives [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=398.0s)]
*  the media crazy and we really would love this guy to stay around forever because no one has [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  been able to take the ideas we have, take them out of Congress and implement them the way Donald [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=407.44s)]
*  Trump has. Yeah, absolutely. De-fringify what was happening at CPAC for all those years and very much [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=411.67999999999995s)]
*  bringing it into the mainstream. Dave Weigel, thanks for joining us. We'll see you later on [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=416.88s)]
*  Morning Joe. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HN_hj1s8oQ&t=420.8s)]
