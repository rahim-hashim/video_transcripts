*  Campers from those rapidly rising waters and right now [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Texas is bracing for more rain with the National Weather Service warning of the possibility of more flash floods over the next few hours [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=54.0s)]
*  President Trump yesterday signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County and spoke to reporters about this deadly storm [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=61.64s)]
*  We want to leave a little time I would have done it today, but we'd just be in their way probably Friday [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=74.8s)]
*  Well FEMA is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=84.16s)]
*  Something we can talk about later, but right now they're busy working so we'll leave it at that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  FEMA is something we'll talk about later, but joining us now NBC News senior national correspondent Jay Gray live this morning from Kerrville, Texas [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=93.72s)]
*  Jay, what is the latest where you are? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  Well Ali it is a mess and is getting worse for many of those in this strike zone [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=103.4s)]
*  We're along what's a river trail here in Kerrville right along the river [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=109.88s)]
*  You can see the tree down behind us you can see all of the debris and limbs pressed up against the railing here [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=113.2s)]
*  We're more than 20 feet above the normal bank of the Guadalupe River [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=118.72s)]
*  So up a hill more than 20 feet and onward that's how fast this water is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=123.4s)]
*  More than 20 feet in 45 minutes or less in some areas too fast [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=128.56s)]
*  A lot of rescue teams are saying to escape something like that especially in the middle of the night [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  Especially for young children more than 80 are known to be dead and they're still trying to identify some of those who died during the storm [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  28 of those children and many from camps [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  There's not only Camp Mystic, but several other camps that are still in the middle of the storm [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  There's not only Camp Mystic, but several other camps along the Guadalupe River here in this part of the Texas Hill Country [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=155.44s)]
*  It's a tradition for families to come here on the 4th of July [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=162.44s)]
*  You heard the governor talking about the number of people that they may not know are missing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=166.44s)]
*  Because they came over set up a tent and we're going to camp out over the 4th of July weekend until these storms came [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=170.44s)]
*  Dozens still missing right now and the work to find those missing continues around the area [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=177.44s)]
*  They're still on the clock entering what is now the 4th day from the air on the ground on horseback [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=184.44s)]
*  They've got thermal imaging looking for heat traces, they've got night vision to work during the night [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=190.44s)]
*  So this is an all out effort that's going to continue they say until everyone is found here [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=196.44s)]
*  And while most of the people in this area, Ali, as you can understand, are still in shock [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=201.44s)]
*  And you can see that, you can hear it in their voices [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=206.44s)]
*  The one thing they haven't given up at this point is hope [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=209.44s)]
*  And that is shared by those rescue teams, by those first responders who do say that they are doing just that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=212.44s)]
*  They stress that this is a rescue mission and they still expect to find survivors alive here [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=219.44s)]
*  And we're going to hold that hope for that community as well [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=225.44s)]
*  But Jay, on top of that, what about the expected storms today that could only complicate those recovery efforts? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=228.44s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right, the forecast isn't doing any favors right now, Ali [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=236.44s)]
*  Yesterday we had more rain and more evacuations in this area [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=242.44s)]
*  Forecasters say that's going to continue for the next 24 hours [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=246.44s)]
*  And what that means, it's not only something that those who are here have to deal with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=250.44s)]
*  But it's those recovery teams, it's those responders [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=255.44s)]
*  They were pulled out yesterday because it's just too dangerous [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=258.44s)]
*  They don't want to see flash flooding come in and take even more lives [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=261.44s)]
*  And so they shift from rescue and recovery to helping people move to higher ground [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=265.44s)]
*  And they themselves getting out and getting to somewhere where it's safe [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=271.44s)]
*  Again, over the next 24 hours we're going to see, at times I've told, some severe rain in this area [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=276.44s)]
*  It's exactly what they don't need [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=282.44s)]
*  And by the way, mentally such a strain over the last four days [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=285.44s)]
*  Any rain here, a trigger for that as well after what they've been through [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=289.44s)]
*  Yeah, of course, NBC News Senior National Correspondent Jay Gray [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=294.44s)]
*  We thank you for reporting live for us this morning from Kerrville, Texas [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=298.44s)]
*  Thank you [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls7KZWd4K-M&t=319.44s)]
