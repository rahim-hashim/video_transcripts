# Senators Continue Talks On New Gun Legislation
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k)
*  Welcome back to way too early. It's a little ahead of 5 30 a.m. on the East Coast to 30 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=0.0s)]
*  out west. I'm Jonathan Lemire. The House Judiciary Committee will hold an emergency [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=10.72s)]
*  session tomorrow and hopes of moving forward a package of gun violence prevention bills. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=15.0s)]
*  The protecting our kids act combines eight gun reform bills. The legislation would raise [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=20.52s)]
*  the age for buying a semi-automatic rifle from 18 to 21, ban high capacity magazines with some [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=26.78s)]
*  exceptions and increase penalties for gun trafficking and straw purchases which are when [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=33.06s)]
*  one person buys a gun for another person who cannot legally own one. The Democratic-led [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=38.38s)]
*  Judiciary Committee wants to get the legislation to the full house for a vote as soon as possible [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  despite the long odds of it getting the 60 votes needed to pass in the Senate. And a bipartisan [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=49.7s)]
*  group of senators will meet again today to discuss a possible path forward on gun safety [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  legislation. A smaller subgroup met yesterday. It included Democrats Chris Murphy and Kirsten [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=62.34s)]
*  Sinema along with Republicans John Cornyn and Tom Tillis. One senator in the larger group tells [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  NBC News that Senator Cornyn's participation is considered a quote good sign since Uvalde is in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=74.94s)]
*  his home state of Texas and given his personal closeness to minority leader Mitch McConnell. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=81.58s)]
*  At an event in Kentucky yesterday McConnell was asked about the issue of no gun legislation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=87.5s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. We have a group led by Senator Cornyn and Senator Murphy on the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  Democrats side discussing how we might be able to come together to target the problem which is [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=101.06s)]
*  mental illness and school safety. We'll get back at it next week and hope that's the result. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=109.02s)]
*  Joining us now congressional reporter for Axios Elena Trena. Elena, great to see you as always. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  You've got some new reporting about these four senators. They met in a smaller group and you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=122.02s)]
*  believe they are now key to getting anything done on gun reform. Give us the update on that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=126.46s)]
*  But also I can't help but notice what McConnell said there. He said the two issues were mental [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=131.9s)]
*  health and school safety. Neither of those things guns. That's definitely observation that I took [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=136.94s)]
*  as well from his remarks yesterday Jonathan. But yes this this core group of four is what a lot of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=145.34s)]
*  aides have described that zoom meeting to me yesterday that these four senators Murphy, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=152.46s)]
*  Sinema, Tillis and Cornyn are really going to be the key to any sort of deal that they can strike [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=159.58s)]
*  on not just gun legislation but but on mental health and school shootings. And the bigger group [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=166.62s)]
*  that met last week which is four other Democrats and four other Republican senators will also meet [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  again later this week I'm told and will still be key to any part of deal. But it's really these four [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=178.3s)]
*  senators that are driving the negotiations right now. And they really have you know they have a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=183.82s)]
*  tall task. They have to try to get a compromise on something by the end of this week and early [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=188.54s)]
*  next week when the Senate returns. And as we've seen in the past unfortunately these bipartisan [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=193.34s)]
*  talks on any sort of legislation have fall through. So a lot of people are still very [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=201.34s)]
*  skeptical. I know that leadership in the Senate, Democratic leadership as well as Republican [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=205.5s)]
*  leadership are still very skeptical. But I spoke with a lot of aides to these senators yesterday [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=209.58s)]
*  and they're all still very optimistic that there's a chance of something. But I am told that really [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=216.3s)]
*  the focus will be more so on mental health. Probably it'll be the largest part of the any [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=222.78s)]
*  sort of package with with gun legislation and school safety being smaller components. And so [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=227.66s)]
*  we'll have to see how these talks shape out. But right now everyone's being really realistic. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=233.98s)]
*  Chris Murphy, the leader of this, has been really transparent and candid that he's not expecting [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  a deal that will probably make most Democrats happy. It'll be something that falls short of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=245.82s)]
*  what many people want. But he thinks that any deal is better than no deal and any progress is better [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=250.78s)]
*  than you know this stalemate that we've seen over the past several years in trying to do anything [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=257.34s)]
*  in this area. Yeah, aides have said to me as well that look any progress is good. It's better than [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=262.14s)]
*  the alternative. But I think there's going to be a lot of frustrated not just Democrats but frankly [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  Americans if what ends up coming from this is something on mental health though important [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=271.58s)]
*  and very little on guns when it seems like that's not the real crux of the issue here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  Alina, let's also switch gears. Axios has gotten some new reporting. Republicans look they feel [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=281.82s)]
*  really confident about a big win in the midterms this fall. We should note it's still many months [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=287.18s)]
*  away. Things can change between now and then. We should keep cautioning that. But certainly the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=291.98s)]
*  Republicans feeling bullish. And Axios has gotten a sneak peek into their plans if they do indeed [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=296.3s)]
*  win in November. What did you guys find? Well, the Republicans, particularly in the House, but [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=301.82s)]
*  definitely on both sides of the aisle, are very eager to begin investigating the Biden administration [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  if they were to win in the fall. And so we have an inside look into how a lot of them met over the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  weekend on the eastern shore of Maryland. Some of this was run by the Heritage Foundation and other [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  conservative groups that are really trying to gather a lot of these current and former Republican [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=330.06s)]
*  aides to begin the process of looking at, okay, how can we shape up and start preparing ourselves [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=336.3s)]
*  for potential investigations if we were to take back the majority in November? Democrats are doing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=343.9s)]
*  that, too. Democrats recognize that there is a very likely possibility that they will lose the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=349.66s)]
*  majority. They're not going to have control over the House, the Senate, and they'll still have the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=354.54s)]
*  White House. But that will lead to a lot of or a lot more scrutiny than they've seen in the year [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=359.1s)]
*  and a half of the Biden administration so far. And we're told that the investigations will go far [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=365.9s)]
*  beyond what people had always kind of promised, which was Hunter Biden. They want to look into [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=370.54s)]
*  Hunter Biden, the president's son, of course, but going beyond that into cabinet officials, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=375.5s)]
*  into certain spending packages and different priorities of the Biden administration. So it's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=380.06s)]
*  really going to be a lot if Republicans are to win in November. Yeah, certainly White House aides [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=386.46000000000004s)]
*  not welcoming those probes, but there is a thought those close to presidents say that, look, obviously [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=392.94s)]
*  they don't want the Republicans to win the House. But if they do, perhaps, especially if these [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=399.82s)]
*  investigations are seen as as far-reaching and fishing expeditions, they could become a useful [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=404.54s)]
*  foil for Biden in the second two years of his first term. Elena Trinive-Axios, we always appreciate it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=409.74s)]
*  Great to see you. We will talk to you again soon. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=415.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWs7NbTGw3k&t=429.82s)]
