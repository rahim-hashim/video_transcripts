# Speaker Johnson has 'constructive' meeting with Rep. Taylor Greene
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94)
*  Back to politics now. House Speaker Mike Johnson is set to meet with far-right congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=0.0s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene again today as she dangles a vote to force his ouster over his [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  head. After talking for nearly two hours last night, reportedly at Greene's request, the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=9.96s)]
*  pair say they'll reconvene today. Last Wednesday, the congressman vowed to file a motion to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=14.84s)]
*  vacate against Johnson this week over his support of sending military aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=21.28s)]
*  It's the same mechanism that Republicans used to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=27.4s)]
*  from his position in October. But unlike last time, House Democratic leaders have said they [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=31.24s)]
*  would provide Johnson the votes to save his speakership should he need them. Following [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=36.86s)]
*  their meeting yesterday, Greene ignored reporters' questions about whether she was backing down [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=41.8s)]
*  from her threat, while Johnson offered a dose of reality about the slim majority House Republicans [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=46.68s)]
*  are working with. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=54.32s)]
*  Had a lengthy, constructive meeting. I understand the frustration I share it. I would really [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=55.32s)]
*  like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here, but the reality [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=62.2s)]
*  is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin. It [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=68.2s)]
*  makes it very difficult for us to, using my football metaphor as I often do, throw touchdown [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  passes on every single player. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=79.08s)]
*  We can see Michael Schnell, congressional reporter for The Hill, in that scrum, and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=81.9s)]
*  now she joins us here on set in Washington. Michael, let's just take us inside this meeting. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  We know another one will continue today. What's the sense here? Is Greene still serious about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  pushing Johnson out? There's some reporting as to what her list of demands are so she [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=97.18s)]
*  wouldn't go through with the motion to vacate. They include things like defunding the Jack [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=103.14000000000001s)]
*  Smith probe and not passing any more aid to Ukraine. Let's have a reality check. There [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=107.14s)]
*  isn't going to be any more aid to Ukraine this year. That huge package just got passed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=112.5s)]
*  The administration recognizes no more is coming. Who knows who's even speaker next year? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=116.54s)]
*  Right. Last week on Wednesday, Congresswoman Greene said she was absolutely going to force [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=121.18s)]
*  a vote on Johnson's ouster. This week there was no doubt about that. She underscored that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=125.98s)]
*  she wanted to put Republicans on the record about whether or not they support Johnson. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=130.2s)]
*  Yesterday, Greene requests a meeting with the speaker, huddles with him for two hours, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=134.42s)]
*  and then they're going to convene another meeting today, which leads you to believe that she's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=139.62s)]
*  looking for some sort of off-ramp here to not have to go through with this motion to vacate. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  There are for a few reasons why that would be. A, it's opposed by a vast majority of the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=149.26s)]
*  House GOP conference, including some of her conservative colleagues. B, Democratic leadership [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=154.54s)]
*  is going to swoop in and protect Johnson. This would blow up in her face on the House floor. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=159.3s)]
*  Three, one of the biggest things is that for President Trump is against this. He has said [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=163.74s)]
*  on a number of occasions that he stands with Speaker Johnson. This is sort of a recipe for [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=167.9s)]
*  failure for Congresswoman Greene. It appears now she is looking for some sort of excuse to sort of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=172.7s)]
*  back off of this threat. But you mentioned some of those demands that have been reported, that she [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  floated in that meeting. Those are sort of moot because the House is not going to have to pass [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=182.3s)]
*  more Ukraine at this Congress. The appropriation season is over, so there's no opportunity to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=186.3s)]
*  defund Jack Smith as she says she wants to. So she's sort of at a pickle right now, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=191.1s)]
*  go through with this and go against many of her conservative colleagues, or try to back off in a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=195.42s)]
*  way that doesn't exactly make sense. Right. And you make a good point about Trump, who gave a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=199.5s)]
*  pretty public display of support of Johnson just in the last couple of days. So let's talk about [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  the futures of these two individuals. You know, as well as I do, there's sort of an open, running [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  joker on Capitol Hill that Marjorie Taylor Greene is sort of speaker already because she wields so [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  much clout. But we're seeing her run up against the limit of that influence now. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  How does she maintain this sort of sway? And how does Johnson continue to lead? He knows his job [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=220.46s)]
*  position is dangling by a thread. He knows that Democrats would have to potentially bail him out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=226.46s)]
*  I mean, his days may be numbered in the job. There's certainly an expectation the Republicans [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=230.86s)]
*  could lose the House. How do they each go forward? Start with Johnson first. He sort of can breathe [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=234.06s)]
*  a sigh of relief right now because the House doesn't have to work on any other big must pass [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=238.78s)]
*  pieces of legislation for the rest of this Congress, with the exception of the FAA [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=243.98000000000002s)]
*  reauthorization bill, which is currently making its way through the Senate. It shouldn't be too [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=247.66s)]
*  controversial in the House. So he doesn't have any more of these controversial pieces of legislation [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=251.34s)]
*  he needs to muscle through the House, which means that he may not see another threat from [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=256.54s)]
*  conservatives because they typically tie their threats to must pass measures. Now, when you talk [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=261.1s)]
*  about Greene on the other hand, she can continue to wield her power by just continuing to dangle [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=266.38s)]
*  this motion to vacate over Johnson's head. So if she comes out of today's meeting and says she [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=270.94s)]
*  doesn't plan to force a vote on his ouster this week, but may do it in the coming weeks, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=274.94s)]
*  that sort of keeps Johnson on edge, keeps him on his toes. He has to keep watching around to see [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=279.58s)]
*  how he handles various legislative issues and handles the House floor in the months to come [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=283.74s)]
*  in the lead up to the election. But that's sort of how she can maintain her influence is by [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=288.22s)]
*  continuing this threat, which may be one reason why Jonathan, she filed this over a month ago [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=292.78s)]
*  and she still isn't forced to vote on it. She's just dangling it over his head. So [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=296.78s)]
*  yeah, we will see what comes of the meeting today. Congressional reporter for the Hill, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=300.14s)]
*  Michael Schnell. Thank you as always. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-V5b1kPP94&t=303.9s)]
