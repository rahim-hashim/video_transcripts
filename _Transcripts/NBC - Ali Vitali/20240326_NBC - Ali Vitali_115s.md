# Baltimore bridge collapses after cargo ship collision
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs)
*  And we now go back to the breaking news out of Baltimore at this hour. Rescue and recovery efforts are underway after the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which is part of Interstate 695, partially collapsed when a large cargo ship struck the bridge overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=0.0s)]
*  You're seeing the footage there of the stunning collapse. Right now it's too early to determine how many people were affected. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=17.0s)]
*  But according to the Associated Press, emergency responders there are searching for at least seven people believed to be in the water. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=25.0s)]
*  The Baltimore Fire Department called the collapse a developing mass casualty event. Francis Scott Key Bridge opened in 1977, a major thoroughfare there in Baltimore. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=33.0s)]
*  This will have implications for traffic in the region for weeks, but the priority, of course, people who may have been on that bridge now in the water. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=45.0s)]
*  Sunrise in Baltimore, 659 a.m., so still nearly an hour and a half away. So rescue efforts currently going on in the dark. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=55.0s)]
*  We will continue to follow this developing story throughout the morning. And we're hearing from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=63.0s)]
*  He tweeted moments ago that he spoke with Maryland Governor Westmore and the mayor of Baltimore to offer the federal department support. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=69.0s)]
*  We will bring you updates throughout the show about this tragedy unfolding in Baltimore. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glPKFrBqpYs&t=76.0s)]
