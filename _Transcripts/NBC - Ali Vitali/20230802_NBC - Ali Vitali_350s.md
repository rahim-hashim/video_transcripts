# Trump indicted in 2020 election case
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls)
*  Joining us now, co-founder of Punchbowl News, Jake Sherman. He is an MSNBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=0.0s)]
*  political contributor and also with us, NBC News justice reporter Ryan Reilly. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Gentlemen, thanks to you both for being here on such an important morning. Jake, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=10.76s)]
*  let's start with you. Give us the sense of the reaction on Capitol Hill, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=14.58s)]
*  particularly from Republicans, to Trump's second federal indictment. This one of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=19.92s)]
*  course hits close to home for so many who were in the Capitol on January 6th [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  trying to avoid a mob, as I know you were, who was fueled to violence by Trump's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=29.98s)]
*  lies. So the reaction is relatively predictable, John, which is that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=35.1s)]
*  Republicans are saying this is a distraction from their investigations [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=41.02s)]
*  into Donald Trump, which is, you know, I would say laughable to be honest with [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=44.82s)]
*  you. But on top of that, I mean, this is something, as we point out in our [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=49.42s)]
*  morning edition this morning, this is not for members of Congress abstract like [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=52.7s)]
*  the document case, which was something that Donald Trump did or didn't do on his [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=57.46s)]
*  own, on his own volition with his, in his home. This is something, this was a case [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=62.5s)]
*  that played out in real time in the public, meaning Donald Trump, according to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=69.9s)]
*  this indictment and according to reality, because we were all watching this, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=74.98s)]
*  sowed doubts about the election and the election process, which indirectly or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=78.58s)]
*  directly led to the January 6th attack on the Capitol, which hundreds of members of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=84.86s)]
*  Congress lived through and were escorted through the Capitol by SWAT team members [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=89.86s)]
*  with machine guns. We all witnessed that. Many of us were there. So listen, the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=95.26s)]
*  biggest reprieve here, I would say, is that members of Congress are on recess [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=100.94s)]
*  until the middle of September. And when they return, this will have been, it will [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=104.53999999999999s)]
*  have been more than a month since this indictment was handed down. But the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=109.06s)]
*  reality is it's 460 days, John, until the 2024 election and hundreds of members of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=112.94s)]
*  Congress, 222 people in the House, 11 Senate Republicans are going to be running [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=119.5s)]
*  and answering questions for the next 460 days as to whether Donald Trump deserved [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=125.06s)]
*  to be indicted and all the particulars of this case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=131.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's sort of the case will provide a backdrop to that campaign. But you're to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=133.86s)]
*  your point, Republicans have made clear that their probe to 200 Biden will [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=137.14s)]
*  continue. Ryan, tell us about the judge that's been assigned to this case. There's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=140.98s)]
*  been so much talk about Aileen Cannon, the judge in South Florida, about how [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=146.66s)]
*  there's fears that she may be sort of deferential to the former president's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=151.14s)]
*  team. But tell us about the one here in the District of Columbia. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know, if if if Trump got really lucky in Florida, he got very unlucky in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=159.5s)]
*  D.C. because this judge, Judge Chuckin, has actually been the harshest [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=164.14s)]
*  sentencer of January six defendants have sat through or listened in on a lot of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=169.26s)]
*  January six cases that she's overseen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=174.22s)]
*  And especially with those lower level cases where the Justice Department was [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=177.82s)]
*  recommending home detention, for example, she said, no, those cases deserve some [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  sort of period of incarceration. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  She's done that several cases that we've seen thus far. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=190.14s)]
*  Now, she's also departed downward in cases where or she's gone below the set. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=194.14s)]
*  What prosecutors sought in several January six cases. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=198.66s)]
*  But she as as the Associated Press has laid out in the most number of January six [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=202.34s)]
*  cases, she's gone upward or at least given the government what they wanted in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  vast majority of her of her cases overall. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=214.18s)]
*  So, you know, this is a person who takes what happened on January six very seriously. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=216.62s)]
*  And so there have to be consequences for what took place that day, the mob violence [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=221.38s)]
*  that we saw. She also was involved in the handing over of the documents when Trump [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=226.22s)]
*  challenged this to begin with. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=232.22s)]
*  So, you know, honestly, if we follow the pattern that we've seen in other cases, it's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=233.74s)]
*  very easily predictable that we're going to see a lot of really awful racist attacks on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=238.46s)]
*  this judge. That's frankly what we've seen in the past. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=243.3s)]
*  And, you know, there's been a huge difference between sort of Trump's enemies who are, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=247.02s)]
*  you know, just white males and the other and the individuals he's targeted who are not. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=250.9s)]
*  So I think that that's what we can expect. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=257.94s)]
*  I've seen that, you know, personally, in a lot of the cases that she's handled on January [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=259.66s)]
*  six thus far that haven't involved Trump. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=263.82s)]
*  So I think we can frankly expect that going forward things to get ugly. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=266.54s)]
*  It's just a matter of how ugly it's going to get. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=271.22s)]
*  Yeah, this could be deeply disturbing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=274.18s)]
*  And the months ahead, Jake, we know the Republicans so often try to get the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=276.3s)]
*  to create false equivalencies, throw up the smoke screen, try to distract from Trump's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=280.94s)]
*  latest legal or political woes. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  Take us inside the thinking of House Speaker McCarthy, if you will, as to how they think [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=289.06s)]
*  they're going to approach this one. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  It was just a few days ago where he seemed to try to tamp down the impeachment inquiry [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=293.82s)]
*  talk into President Biden. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=298.62s)]
*  And then only a couple of days later, we heard former President Trump push him to do [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=300.66s)]
*  that again. Yeah, I think I think this increases the likelihood of an impeachment. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=304.1s)]
*  I think McCarthy will again say that this is a distraction. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=308.22s)]
*  He said that last night, a distraction into the investigation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=311.98s)]
*  I think the investigations will hit a fever pitch, John, when Congress returns in [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=314.54s)]
*  September. All right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=319.70000000000005s)]
*  Well, Jake Sherman, thank you so very much. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=321.3s)]
*  And Ryan Riley, thank you as well. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  We're going to be watching your coverage throughout the day here on MSNBC. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=324.54s)]
*  We appreciate it. Both of you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=327.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLGWkIQ5fls&t=338.22s)]
