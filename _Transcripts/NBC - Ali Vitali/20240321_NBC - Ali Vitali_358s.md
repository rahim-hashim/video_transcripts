Video Description: No Labels has announced its ballot access in 18 states, signaling potential disruption in the upcoming election. Despite facing rejections from prospective candidates, the move has prompted Democratic concerns about a third-party candidate tilting the election. The DNC is assembling a legal team to counter this emerging threat, particularly in key states. The Bulwark's Tim Miller joins Way Too Early to highlight the uncertain impact of third-party candidates on voter preferences, particularly amid varied voter discontent with established candidates.

# 'Rich folks in a bubble': No Labels continues to fuel third-party election tensions
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo)
*  No Label says it has secured ballot access in Rhode Island, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=0.0s)]
*  meaning a total of 18 states now have the third party group on the ballot. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=4.36s)]
*  The organization made the announcement on social media yesterday, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=8.84s)]
*  but has yet to announce or even determine who will be on its ticket as [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=12.36s)]
*  president as presidential candidates. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=17.6s)]
*  NBC News has learned that no labels has been turned down by at least a dozen [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=19.0s)]
*  prospective candidates. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=24.64s)]
*  And on the front page of the New York Times today, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=26.56s)]
*  a new article reveals Democrats have become increasingly alarmed by the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=29.08s)]
*  potential for third party candidates who could swing the election to former [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=33.24s)]
*  president Trump. In response, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=37.36s)]
*  the Democratic party is putting together a new team of lawyers aimed at tracking [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=39.56s)]
*  the threat, especially in key battleground states, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  amounting to what's being described as a state by state counter insurgency plan. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  Joining us now host of the Bullwark podcast, Tim Miller. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  He previously served as communications director for Jeb Bush and spokesman for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  the Republican National Committee. We're always grateful when he can join us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Tim, good to see you. So let's talk about no labels here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=64.76s)]
*  They've secured access on nearly 20 states. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=68.72s)]
*  If they field a candidate and that remains an if they could play a role here [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  in this election, what do you think their motives are? What's happening? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=81.52s)]
*  I think that it's a lot of rich folks that are in a bubble. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=83.64s)]
*  And in the bubble, which they exist, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=86.64s)]
*  there's a lot of unhappiness with both candidates. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=88.8s)]
*  There's a decent amount of unhappiness with both candidates around the country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  Of course, everybody's seen the poll numbers of that, but basically, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=94.6s)]
*  throughout most of America, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  even those who are among this group of the double haters, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=101.6s)]
*  people that dislike both candidates, there's one that they prefer pretty strongly. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=104.44s)]
*  And disproportionately, if we look at the 2020 results, those folks prefer Joe Biden. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=109.0s)]
*  And I think the big difference between in 2016 and 2020 is that in 2020, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden won huge margins among people that dislike both candidates. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, as of 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton among those voters, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  in part because the third party candidates bled from her. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=126.48s)]
*  So I think I think that, you know, basically in New York, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  in the cell corridor in these big cities where Mark Penn and Nancy Jacobson [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=134.92s)]
*  who run this group, in their environs, these big donors, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=139.24s)]
*  there's a lot of support for finding a third candidate, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=143.96s)]
*  but there just isn't a lot of popular support. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=146.2s)]
*  And the candidates who kick the tires on this, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=148.16s)]
*  once they start to look into the polling data more closely, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  they realize that this is a dead end deal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=154.16s)]
*  It's been pretty noteworthy that the Biden team has really started to take [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=156.8s)]
*  swipes at Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=160.32s)]
*  I don't think it was any coincidence that the president posed with dozens [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=162.04s)]
*  of members of the Kennedy family at the St. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=165.84s)]
*  Patrick's Day reception at the White House over the weekend. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=167.48s)]
*  Where do you perceive how much of a threat do you perceive as R.F.K. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=170.08s)]
*  Jr. and to which candidate, Trump or Biden? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=174.12s)]
*  Yeah, R.F.K. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=177.64s)]
*  Jr. is this weird wild card where it's kind of a known unknown, as Rumsfeld would say. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=178.64s)]
*  You know, my gut instinct at the start of this was that Robert F. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=184.08s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. would actually hurt Trump among kind of the more [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=187.6s)]
*  contrarian, anti-vax, you know, low, low propensity [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=191.28s)]
*  voters that Trump attracts that some of them might cleave off and go for R.F.K. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=196.76s)]
*  But, you know, I think that because of some concerns about Biden's age, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=202.68s)]
*  because some unhappiness, still some lingering unhappiness about about inflation, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=207.24s)]
*  even though that's come down now, I just don't I think the balance [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=211.24s)]
*  might go the other way because I'm thinking about some of these, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=215.12s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of reporting about voters of color, younger black voters, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=219.32s)]
*  for example, that aren't that happy with Biden. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=223.52s)]
*  Might Kennedy be an off ramp for them, right, when they would come around [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=225.88s)]
*  and kind of hold their nose and vote for Joe Biden anyway in November? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=229.72s)]
*  So it was a two person race. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=233.0s)]
*  So I think I'm glad the DNC is taking this very seriously. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=234.28s)]
*  I don't think it's clear who R.F.K. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=237.56s)]
*  Jr. will take from at this point. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=239.92s)]
*  I think I think obviously given the stakes of the election, diligence is critical here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=242.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Tim, just give us your big picture of thoughts as to where things [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=245.88s)]
*  stand in the election right now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=248.32s)]
*  President Biden on a bit of an upswing since the State of the Union. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=250.88s)]
*  He's on an aggressive campaign schedule and has a significant financial [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=253.4s)]
*  advantage over Trump. But polls suggest that in those key battlegrounds, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=257.0s)]
*  Trump has narrow but consistent leads. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=260.88s)]
*  Where do you think things stand right now? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=263.92s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's still a pretty friendly map for Joe Biden. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=266.76s)]
*  I think if you look at the fact that you can just win Michigan, Pennsylvania, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=270.56s)]
*  Arizona, which have have all trended pretty blue lately, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=274.48s)]
*  if you look at the governor's races in the midterms, you look at 2020, of course. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=279.56s)]
*  So I think that's good news. The financial advantage is good news. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=283.32s)]
*  But you just have to be honest. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, there is a bleed in his coalition. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=287.36s)]
*  You would have thought at this point, given what Donald Trump did after January [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=290.24s)]
*  6th, that there'd be a bigger group of Donald Trump voters who peeled off. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=293.88s)]
*  But at this point, you look at there's a small number of Donald Trump voters, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  very small, who have peeled off. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=301.0s)]
*  And Biden is still having trouble, you know, with some of these [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=302.76000000000005s)]
*  moderate voters in the suburbs, they did well with and also with some in the core [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=306.8s)]
*  Democratic coalition, younger voters and voters of color. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  And so Biden needs to consolidate the folks that voted for him in 2020. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=314.92s)]
*  He's got the money to do that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=320.6s)]
*  Things are getting better in the economy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=322.36s)]
*  So I think that there's some shines of light for Biden, but there's still reason [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=323.8s)]
*  to be worried. Tim Miller, great analysis, as always. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=327.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. Come back soon. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  And thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on this Thursday [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=332.04s)]
*  morning. Morning Joe starts right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2dU9J_oWo&t=335.8s)]
