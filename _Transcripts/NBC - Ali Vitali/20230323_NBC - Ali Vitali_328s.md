# Republicans blame Biden for looming debt crisis
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k)
*  The United States is inching closer to defaulting on its debt, and Congress has made no progress [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=0.0s)]
*  on a way to avoid a debt-stealing crisis. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=6.12s)]
*  Now Republicans are blaming the president for the stalled negotiations. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=9.32s)]
*  It's wrong for him to say that they're flirting with the default. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=15.4s)]
*  They're trying to cause a default. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=17.84s)]
*  Because he's the one saying he won't accept any conditions, notwithstanding the fact that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=19.96s)]
*  the conditions have, for a long time, been a norm that we've often resorted to. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=23.6s)]
*  Not enough, in my opinion, but we have resorted to. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=28.88s)]
*  And if Joe Biden is unwilling to talk about those policies, then when the shutdown comes, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=31.32s)]
*  it's on him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=38.92s)]
*  When moms and dads get laid off, and when unemployment doubles and the stock market [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=40.92s)]
*  collapses, remember, Joe Biden sat on his hands while we urged and demanded action. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=46.16s)]
*  If Joe Biden was your husband, he would say, honey, I know we only make $4,000 a month, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=54.08s)]
*  but let's spend $7,000 a month. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=59.0s)]
*  You know that does not work. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=61.6s)]
*  Every wife in America would shudder if that was her husband. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=63.84s)]
*  But what we can do is prove to the American people that before we're going to have a conversation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=66.92s)]
*  about mandatory spending, we're not going to be sending money to pro-prostitution LGBTQ [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=71.84s)]
*  groups in Colombia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=78.44s)]
*  Because that's what you're doing with your tax dollars right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  Needless to say, most of that's not true. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=82.92s)]
*  President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy have only met once so far. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=86.76s)]
*  It was last month. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=90.36s)]
*  Biden wants Congress to raise the debt ceiling, but McCarthy says he'll only do that if there [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=91.6s)]
*  are spending cuts. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=95.6s)]
*  But McCarthy has not said what budgets he wants to slash. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=96.6s)]
*  Joining us now to help us with this, co-founder of Punchbowl News, Jake Sherman. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=100.08s)]
*  He is an MSNBC political contributor. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=104.24s)]
*  So we should underline that, that the Republicans in the House have not put out their own budget [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=107.0s)]
*  yet. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=110.44s)]
*  So, Jake, talk to us about where we are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=111.44s)]
*  I mean, we've always known that probably wouldn't be significant movement until the deadline, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=113.44s)]
*  a few months off. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=117.6s)]
*  But as with these bank failures and some real unease about the economy, this feels like [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=118.6s)]
*  the tensions are already really heightening. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=123.6s)]
*  Tell us where we are. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=126.0s)]
*  You could just ignore most of that because none of those people will be involved in any [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=127.55999999999999s)]
*  sort of effort to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=131.6s)]
*  That's just noise, complete noise and silliness. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=133.76s)]
*  This is going to be, if it comes together, a deal between Kevin McCarthy and Joe Biden. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=137.88s)]
*  They've met. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=143.12s)]
*  It's a fair thing to say that Biden is going to wait for the budget to come out. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=144.68s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  But their time is running out and Kevin McCarthy wants to talk. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=151.18s)]
*  It's very clear to me at this point that there will be some sort of deal to raise the debt [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=155.24s)]
*  limit. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=159.6s)]
*  It will include spending, reverting spending to a lower level. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=160.6s)]
*  I mean, that will be a subject of negotiation between McCarthy and Biden. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  We need to remember here, number one, we need to remember that UConn's playing tonight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=171.92s)]
*  UConn needs to win. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  And number two, we need to remember that this is going to be a June, July story. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  And the closer we get to June and July, the more markets are going to shutter and the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  more the noise is going to increase. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=186.11999999999998s)]
*  But we don't have to at this point pay attention much to what Lauren Boebert and Rick Scott [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=187.72s)]
*  are saying about the debt limit. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=193.76s)]
*  Yeah, I always have a policy of rooting for New England schools in March. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  So I'm with you on that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=198.88s)]
*  Real quick, I'll follow up on this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=200.52s)]
*  We do know that McCarthy's hold on the speakership is pretty tenuous and it doesn't take much [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=202.4s)]
*  to call for a vote to try to oust him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=207.36s)]
*  Do we think he's risking that with this kind of rhetoric or he's going to ignore them too? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  No, I think he understands that this is all part of the silly season. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  We see this in negotiations and standoffs all the time, John. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=218.24s)]
*  Listen, anyone can call for a vote for his ouster. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=222.44s)]
*  He's given the right everything they want. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=224.96s)]
*  If it were up to him, he'd probably just do a clean debt limit. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=228.4s)]
*  But he can't do that, obviously. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=231.28s)]
*  And this is going to be, you know, we're seeing the posturing and it's too early to say whether [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=233.12s)]
*  McCarthy's in any peril because of his stance here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=237.96s)]
*  So earlier this week, you spoke to Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=241.28s)]
*  I saw you there in your shirt sleeves. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  And there we go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=246.44s)]
*  And you did she discussed what she called the weaponization of the federal government [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=247.8s)]
*  amid the Manhattan D.A. probe into Trump, which we've been talking about all morning. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=251.76s)]
*  Give us a little more sense as to what she had to say. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=255.4s)]
*  Is she representative of where most Republicans are? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, most Republicans in the House, definitely not the Senate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Miss Stefanik is one of the presidents or the former president's most staunch allies [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=264.88s)]
*  and defenders. But listen, it's amazing that they're launching this investigation before [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  the indictment even comes out. It shows the the thirst for these investigations and quite [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=274.52s)]
*  honestly, the thirst to defend Trump, no matter what the situation is. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  Stefanik is that is at the tip of that spear. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=283.88s)]
*  And it was warm in Orlando. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=285.96s)]
*  So I decided to wear to wear short sleeves, John. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=288.28s)]
*  I hope that's OK. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=290.64s)]
*  No, I wasn't. I wasn't questioning this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=292.08s)]
*  As you know, it was it was smart. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  It was it was a good look. Hey, look, the whole tableau looks great. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=295.52s)]
*  Co-founder and it also reflects the quality of interviews you guys are getting over there at [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  Punchbowl News. So congrats to you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=302.88s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=304.28s)]
*  We'll talk to you again soon. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgnXK4slm7k&t=306.52s)]
