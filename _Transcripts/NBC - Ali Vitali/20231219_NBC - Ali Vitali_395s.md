# Dems seek to restrain new immigration powers, fearing abuse by Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM)
*  Key senators are set to head back to the Capitol this morning as we're learning some new details [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=0.0s)]
*  about the negotiations for an immigration and border policy deal in exchange for aid [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=5.2s)]
*  to Ukraine and Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=10.72s)]
*  Two sources with knowledge of the talks are telling NBC News that senators in the negotiations [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=12.76s)]
*  are exploring ways to prevent a future president from abusing some of the executive powers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=18.2s)]
*  to control the number of migrants seeking asylum. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=23.94s)]
*  Specifically, one source says Democrats, with former President Trump in mind, want a quote [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=27.64s)]
*  safety valve to avoid cruelty and mass roundups far beyond the goal of controlling the border itself. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=33.68s)]
*  That's a key sticking point as Republicans demand more expansive powers for the executive [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=40.72s)]
*  branch to crack down on a border situation they describe as uncontrolled and chaotic. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=45.16s)]
*  Still, Senate leaders are cautiously optimistic about getting a deal done. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Madam President, over the past week, Democrats and Republicans have made important progress [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  towards an agreement on the national security supplemental. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  While the job is not finished, I'm confident we're headed in the right direction. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=66.88s)]
*  There are a number of significant issues our colleagues are still working to resolve. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=72.24s)]
*  I'm encouraged by our colleagues' commitment to keep making steady progress in their negotiations [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=79.24s)]
*  over the coming week. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=85.44s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional reporter for Politico and the lead writer for the Huddle [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=87.72s)]
*  newsletter, Daniela Diaz. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=91.72s)]
*  Good morning, Daniela. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=93.4s)]
*  Great to see you again. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=94.4s)]
*  So the Huddle headlined it this way, senators get more impatient with secret border Ukraine [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=95.4s)]
*  talks. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  So tell us why it's secret and why are these senators getting so impatient beyond the obvious [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  that there's no deal yet? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  Jonathan, you know as well as I do that if Democrats and Republicans talk broadly about [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=108.84s)]
*  what a border package could look like that would be included in this border, or excuse [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=115.8s)]
*  me, the supplemental funding package that would have Israel aid, Ukraine aid, things [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=120.16s)]
*  can get messy incredibly quickly once people start weighing in on what should and shouldn't [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  be in this package. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=129.6s)]
*  I've been speaking at length with Latinos on the House side and the Democratic side, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=130.6s)]
*  members who have constituents that are incredibly concerned about what border measures could [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=138.76s)]
*  be included in a supplemental funding package. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=142.8s)]
*  And they say that they feel that they're not at the negotiating table. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=145.04s)]
*  Now remember, the three key negotiators here are James Langford, a Republican, Kristen [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=147.92s)]
*  Sinema, independent from Arizona, and of course, Chris Murphy, Democrat from Connecticut. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=153.8s)]
*  And he is actually the key negotiator that came up with a gun reform package in recent [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=158.46s)]
*  years. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=163.36s)]
*  So that's why he's at the negotiating table with Republicans. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=164.36s)]
*  But this is some really high stakes negotiations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=166.84s)]
*  And while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made it seem like there could be a vote this [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=170.24s)]
*  week on a package, it doesn't seem like that's going to happen anymore. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=174.96s)]
*  So if it pushes to January, let's talk how much trickier this gets because the continuing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=178.36s)]
*  resolutions that have funded the government are about to expire. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=183.74s)]
*  So give us a preview as to what the first few weeks of 2024 could look like if indeed [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=187.14s)]
*  there's no deal reached before Christmas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=192.8s)]
*  Jonathan, we're expecting January to be quite a mess on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=195.24s)]
*  Not only is that first laddered CR, stepstool CR, whatever you'd like to call that stopgap [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  measure that's funding the government, is going to the deadline is in January, mid-January. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=205.0s)]
*  Not only is that going to happen and that Congress is going to have to figure out how [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  to fund the government again, Ukraine aid, Israel aid, a major priority for Democrats [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=214.32s)]
*  and some Republicans will also need to be voted on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  And that's only if there's border measures. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=223.04s)]
*  They still haven't been able to reach a deal on that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  And of course, Speaker Mike Johnson has committed to passing appropriations and they [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=227.32s)]
*  haven't even been able to do that in the House. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=232.64s)]
*  And the House isn't scheduled to come back until the second week of January, really close [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  to that deadline of January 19th when the government funding is supposed to be up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  So there's a lot at stake in January. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=242.84s)]
*  As you know, as the viewers know, Congress is really slow when it comes to passing legislation [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=246.4s)]
*  and getting these things done. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=252.44s)]
*  So it's going to be a lot for them to deal with when they come back from the holidays [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=254.08s)]
*  in January. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  That's going to be a white knuckle ride that no one wants to take. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  So you mentioned the concerns among some of the Latino members. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=261.56s)]
*  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has largely been sidelined from these talks. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=265.08s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about what they want to see here, but also broader, more broadly [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=269.16s)]
*  the politics of this bill as we head into an election year where certainly there are [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=274.2s)]
*  some progressives who are very, very concerned about what sort of strict border measures [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=278.2s)]
*  may be put in place, but also polling suggests a lot of independent voters think something [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=282.4s)]
*  needs to get done on the border. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=287.36s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans have weighed in on this issue time and time again and believe [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=290.2s)]
*  that something should be done on the border, regardless of what side you're on. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=295.0s)]
*  But the bigger picture here is that these members in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=298.56s)]
*  come from a variety of different factions of the Democratic Party, and they all speak [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  to constituents that want different things in immigration reform, any immigration changes [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=307.84s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  The bigger picture here is that part of what's being discussed right now is changes to the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  asylum system, to parole, and that is something that a lot of CHC members don't want to see [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  because they believe it's important for the United States to allow the processing of migrants [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  who are seeking asylum. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=332.32s)]
*  Now, Republicans want changes, and as they've been calling it time and time again, border [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=333.68s)]
*  security measures. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  A lot of them have been talking about Title 42-type measures, essentially sending people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  back to a third-party country after they've applied for asylum instead of waiting in the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=344.08s)]
*  United States. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=348.56s)]
*  Democrats don't want to see that, at least more progressive members. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=349.68s)]
*  So that is really what we're seeing from the CHC members who are frustrated that they're [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=352.36s)]
*  not at the negotiating table. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=356.24s)]
*  And we may have another moment in early next year of America broadcasting its dysfunction [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=358.0s)]
*  to the world, not able to get a border deal, potentially the government closing, and not [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=362.44s)]
*  able to send desperately needed funds to both Israel and Ukraine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=366.8s)]
*  Politico's Daniella Diaz, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANDnka-8UeM&t=371.2s)]
