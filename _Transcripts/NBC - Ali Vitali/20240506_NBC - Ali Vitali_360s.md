# Judge: Trump has 'absolute right' to testify
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y)
*  We want to turn back to Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial, which resumes in just a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=0.0s)]
*  few hours. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=6.9s)]
*  On Friday, Judge Juan Marchand cleared up a lie that Trump was spreading outside the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  courtroom. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=12.56s)]
*  Early last week, Trump told reporters that the gag order currently in place prevented [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=14.0s)]
*  him from testifying. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  But the judge clarified that was simply not true, saying that Trump has the absolute right [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=19.78s)]
*  to testify. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  At the same time, a source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed to NBC News that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=26.56s)]
*  Trump paid his $9,000 contempt fine on Thursday for the nine initial violations of the gag [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=31.72s)]
*  order. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=37.92s)]
*  The judge is expected to issue a decision on four more gag order violations sometime [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=39.28s)]
*  later this week. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC legal analyst Danny Savalos. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=47.2s)]
*  Danny, good to see you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  So let's start though with Hope Hicks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  We mentioned earlier in the show, she closed out testimony on Friday, closed out the week, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=55.72s)]
*  in an appearance that eventually got pretty emotional. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  She resumes her testimony today, takes the stand again in just a couple hours. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=65.92s)]
*  Give us your main takeaways from Friday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=69.64s)]
*  Who did you help more, the prosecution or the defense? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=72.44s)]
*  Probably the prosecution after all. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=76.0s)]
*  They never would have called her if they didn't think that she was helpful to their case. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=77.12s)]
*  Number one, she doesn't have the same credibility issues as some of the other prosecution witnesses. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Whether that be Keith Davidson or of course Michael Cohen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=85.68s)]
*  Number two, she points out that the Trump campaign, including her, were very concerned [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=90.0s)]
*  about these allegations of women, about having romantic interludes with Donald Trump and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=95.64000000000001s)]
*  how they might affect the campaign. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  She describes a scene of chaos within the campaign with this concern about what to do [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  about these stories. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=110.48s)]
*  And then finally, I thought this was significant. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=111.68s)]
*  She apparently, Donald Trump, admitted to her that he was aware that Michael Cohen had [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  paid Stormy Daniels. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=118.96s)]
*  Now, a qualification there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  You don't know exactly when Donald Trump acquired that knowledge. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=122.96s)]
*  It was after Michael Cohen gave a statement to the Times. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=125.96s)]
*  So it's well into the presidency itself and after the election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  So a bit of a mixed bag even on that point. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=132.92s)]
*  But overall, some generally good testimony for the prosecution. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  So Hope Hicks goes back to the stand today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=141.0s)]
*  Where do we think the day will lead us? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=143.8s)]
*  Here's the thing with Hope Hicks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=147.72s)]
*  I just briefly want to talk about the defense. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=148.72s)]
*  The defense did score some points with Hope Hicks. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, she was a mixed bag. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=153.84s)]
*  There was a lot of reporting that Hope Hicks devastated Donald Trump. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=155.52s)]
*  I don't agree. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=159.12s)]
*  I think there were a couple important points that Hope Hicks gave the defense. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  Number one, that there were things she didn't testify about. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=164.36s)]
*  I think people like me were thinking Hope Hicks was next to Donald Trump for literally [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=168.16000000000003s)]
*  years, very close to him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=172.72s)]
*  I thought there would be more bombshells. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=173.72s)]
*  There weren't really those bombshells. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=176.08s)]
*  Number two, she painted Michael Cohen as kind of this bumbling wannabe Mr. Fix It and suggested [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=177.96s)]
*  that going rogue is exactly the kind of thing that Michael Cohen might do and make these [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=183.96s)]
*  payments without any authority. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=188.88s)]
*  I promise you the word rogue will appear somewhere in the defense's closing argument. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  Finally, you got this testimony about Michael Cohen and all of the more unreliability that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  is placed on Michael Cohen. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=204.64s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that the defense absolutely loves. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=210.12s)]
*  Let's talk about the gag order violations that we opened this segment with. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=211.12s)]
*  We don't know precisely what day the judge will make a decision. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=215.6s)]
*  Give us your thoughts about the initial violations, why they came about. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  They succeeded in restraining Trump. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=223.76s)]
*  What might we see from the judge in his next decision? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  In a sense, the judge maxed out the monetary fine against Donald Trump because he gave [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=229.28s)]
*  the statutory maximum of $1,000 per violation and complained at the time that it wasn't [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=234.62s)]
*  enough for someone as well-heeled as Donald Trump. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=240.56s)]
*  In a way, he's sort of giving a signal he'd be willing to accelerate the process because [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=244.64s)]
*  all contempt violations, all kinds of punishments related to this kind of gag order violation [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=248.92s)]
*  must be incremental. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  You start out with fines, and even the people in the beginning weren't looking for incarceration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  But the judge suggested that at the end of this continuum could be incarceration. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=260.88s)]
*  I don't think he's there yet, but if we continue with this sort of rolling once-a-week gag [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  order violation hearing, then yes, I think at the end of this ladder is possible incarceration. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=270.08s)]
*  But make no mistake about it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=276.8s)]
*  No judge wants to try and jail a former president. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=278.6s)]
*  It would be an administrative nightmare. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=281.98s)]
*  So both sides are playing a kind of very silly game of chicken in terms of seeing who dares [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=284.0s)]
*  to put Donald Trump in jail. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=290.5s)]
*  And lastly, Danny, and briefly, just give us a quick sense of what else you'd be looking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=293.12s)]
*  for out of the courtroom today. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  We don't really know the lists of who's going to appear, but there are some notable witnesses. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  Of course, the marquee witness is Michael Cohen. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Might we see Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=306.92s)]
*  I think yes, Stormy Daniels. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  But really, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, their evidence really isn't as compelling [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  as some of the other evidence which locks in the transactions. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=315.6s)]
*  Look for the witnesses that you maybe haven't heard their names before, because they're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=319.56s)]
*  the ones that often have some of the most compelling, if maybe sometimes dry, evidence [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=322.88s)]
*  and information. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=328.48s)]
*  Well, we of course will have complete analysis throughout the morning and live reporting [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=329.48s)]
*  from outside the New York City courtroom. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst, Daniel Stavallos, thank you as always. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNdp5t1_2Y&t=336.2s)]
