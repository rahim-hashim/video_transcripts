# New program has pharmacists prescribe abortion pills
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A)
*  Welcome back. There's a new strategy in the fight to expand access to abortion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=0.0s)]
*  health care, receiving an abortion pill prescription from your neighborhood [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=4.48s)]
*  pharmacists. The program is still new. So far, it's only being tested in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Washington state, but it's expected to expand to other states where abortion [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=11.96s)]
*  is legal. The New York Times reports supporters of abortion rights consider [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=15.72s)]
*  pharmacists prescribing part of an effort to open as many avenues as [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=19.56s)]
*  possible at a time when abortion pills are facing growing attacks from [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=23.56s)]
*  abortion opponents. And joining us now, the president of Cobalt Advocates, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=27.72s)]
*  Karen Middleton, her organization is a nonprofit that raises funds for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  abortion access. So, Karen, this was such a central piece of the 2024 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=35.68s)]
*  platform for Democrats. The battle cry of we're not going back from the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=40.64s)]
*  vice president was something that comes to mind. And then we watched as in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  states where Democrats hoped this could help them. It really didn't end up [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=47.92s)]
*  being a major energizing factor. So what are you seeing on the ground? Where [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=51.96s)]
*  does the abortion battle go from here? In Colorado, what we have seen is that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=55.88s)]
*  this has been a nonpartisan or bipartisan issue for decades, which is [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=60.92s)]
*  why I guess I'm less surprised that it didn't work for everybody because we [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=65.0s)]
*  see voters across the spectrum and we've had voters cross party lines to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=69.92s)]
*  vote in support of abortion rights and then vote for Republican candidates. So [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  it is I think that we need to understand that abortion rights and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  reproductive rights in general is a broader issue. And I think Democrats can [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=83.12s)]
*  learn a lesson from 2024 in having a broader message that appeals to a wider [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=88.92s)]
*  audience. I think you're right, especially when you look at polling [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=94.04s)]
*  nationally that shows that the majority of people, six in 10 is the general [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  average, believe that abortion should be safe and legal in most cases. So I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  think you're right on the politics piece of this. But Colorado, where you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=105.44s)]
*  guys operate, could be instructive in this larger battle because in 2024, as we [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=109.6s)]
*  were talking in the break, the state voted to enshrine a protection for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=114.52s)]
*  abortion into the state constitution. But there's also more that's being done, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=118.16s)]
*  right? Yes. Well, and to think about it, Colorado has always viewed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  government out of my business, Western values. So some of it is regional, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=125.6s)]
*  but I think the lessons learned are you have to do a lot of work before you [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=130.35999999999999s)]
*  get to the election, talking to voters, speaking in community, involving [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=133.84s)]
*  patients, providers and people who are impacted, like those people who are [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=138.68s)]
*  trying to access pharmacy prescribed contraception or abortion medication. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=142.72s)]
*  Now, I think the other piece of the conversation, too, is you work for an [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=147.72s)]
*  abortion fund. I know a lot of the conversation nationally ends up talking [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=151.28s)]
*  about Planned Parenthood. That does important work in this space, but [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=154.52s)]
*  they're different. Abortion funds. The last I checked were struggling because [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=157.28s)]
*  the demand had gotten so high. The funding was no longer there. What are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=161.36s)]
*  you seeing in terms of demand in terms of the people who are coming to you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  looking for help? We are seeing an exponential rise and it is not slowing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  down. So we're both a reproductive rights organization with an abortion [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  fund. So we're a little bit stronger in being able to both pass policy and also [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  push for those protections. We must figure out a systemic way to expand [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=182.56s)]
*  reproductive health care. In the meantime, abortion funds are mission [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  critical for helping anyone who needs access to get the care they need. And [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=192.6s)]
*  that's because and forgive me if I'm explaining this incorrectly, but [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  abortion funds are really there for the logistics of this, especially when you [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=200.68s)]
*  look at the patchwork of laws across the country. If a woman in Texas is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=203.88s)]
*  looking for the nearest state that she can go to access care, that's where [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=207.92s)]
*  abortion funds come in saying we can help you get there. That's exactly [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=211.68s)]
*  right. And we really became a travel agency overnight and had to increase [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=215.2s)]
*  people not just pay for the care once they get there, but to get them there. So [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=219.8s)]
*  that is travel, flights, gas cards, child care, hotel rooms, meals. It's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  really wraparound service and it's not sustainable in the long haul. But I think [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  for the next, you know, we're planning to grow and spend more money this year [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=234.78s)]
*  and we hope that people really see things need to change. Karen Middleton, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=239.24s)]
*  thank you for joining us, giving us an update from the ground in Colorado. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdRPphYx9A&t=243.84s)]
