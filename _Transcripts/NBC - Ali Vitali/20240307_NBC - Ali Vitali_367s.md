# Former Rep. Liz Cheney launches new PAC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY)
*  Just one day after former President Trump swept all but one of the Super Tuesday states, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=0.0s)]
*  former Congressman Liz Cheney is launching a new political action committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  She unveiled her new PAC, the Great Task on Social Media, with a scathing post, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=9.76s)]
*  skewering her party for once again Donald Trump as its nominee. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=15.44s)]
*  She wrote this, the GOP has chosen. They will nominate a man who attempted to overturn an election [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=20.56s)]
*  and seize power. We have eight months to save our republic and ensure that Donald Trump is never [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=26.56s)]
*  anywhere near the Oval Office again. The Great Task is a multi-candidate PAC sponsored by the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=32.32s)]
*  former Congresswoman. The PAC is not yet affiliated with any presidential candidate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=38.0s)]
*  Joining us now, former Republican Congressman David Jolly of Florida. David, thanks so much [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=43.76s)]
*  for being with us this morning. So let's start there. Liz Cheney is representative of a significant [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=48.56s)]
*  group of Republicans, voters, who simply will not back Donald Trump. We saw a lot of them break for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=53.76s)]
*  Nikki Haley in recent weeks. Do you think they'll hold firm and either support President Biden, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=60.32s)]
*  support a third party candidate, stay home, or will they inevitably come back to the GOP and Trump? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=69.28s)]
*  Well, I think that's the decisive question in November, Jonathan. Will they stay, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=75.68s)]
*  will their opposition to Donald Trump lead them to vote for Joe Biden or will they stay home or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=81.2s)]
*  consider a third party? And this is where I think the leadership of Nikki Haley and Liz Cheney and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=85.84s)]
*  others become so critically important. I'm not sure that Nikki Haley herself really led a movement [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=91.36000000000001s)]
*  as much as she did create a vessel for these voters. And so if you are one of these voters [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  who was most concerned with Donald Trump's fitness, his fitness for office was why you opposed him. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=103.12s)]
*  The fact that he won on Super Tuesday doesn't make him more fit for office. And so [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=108.48s)]
*  where is the intellectual honesty? Where is the call to action? It kind of requires you to actually [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=113.28s)]
*  then say, well, I'm going to vote for Joe Biden. And I would suggest with all due respect to Liz [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=119.68s)]
*  Cheney, who is a true patriot and has demonstrated that in the last year, the line that is missing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=125.28s)]
*  from her statement is, therefore, I will be voting for Joe Biden and I'm asking you to as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=131.6s)]
*  Jonathan, this is not 2016 where there's a lot of unknowns. It's not 2020. It's 2024. We know the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=137.92s)]
*  threat that Donald Trump is. The voters who voted for Haley said he is a threat, he is unfit. So the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=144.72s)]
*  only answer then is to go all the way and suggest, so therefore I will vote for Joe Biden. And I think [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=150.64s)]
*  we should hear that from Nikki Haley and Liz Cheney. I'm not sure we will from Haley. Maybe [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  we will from Liz Cheney before November. David, give us your brief assessment simply of what [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  these primaries showed us about Trump's strengths and more importantly, his weaknesses. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=166.64s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, I think Donald Trump is in a lot of trouble. I mean, we look at the polls and you [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=172.32s)]
*  see notionally he's up a few points over Joe Biden. We looked at the electoral map, but the truth is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=176.55999999999997s)]
*  this coalition of soft Republicans and independents who have chosen Democrats over Republicans, they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  were there in 18, 20, 22. They're still there in 24. And in 24, we actually have the motivating [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  issues like dobs and reproductive freedom that we didn't have in 18 and 20. I think Donald Trump is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=194.8s)]
*  in trouble. Ignore the polls for a minute. I would much rather be in Joe Biden's position today than [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  in Donald Trump's. So Joe Biden has a big position tonight. The State of the Union Address, a national [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  audience, probably his biggest audience of the year. The only one coming close might be his [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  convention speech or if he and Trump do have a debate or two. What does he need to do tonight [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  in terms of policy, but also proving vitality when he speaks to the voters? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=219.2s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think Joe Biden is in a very strong position. I think the one thing that has to happen [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=225.2s)]
*  before November by Biden and Democrats is to take control of the issues of the economy and the border. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  And you're seeing him do that. But right now, I think Republicans have gotten away with framing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=237.28s)]
*  the issue. The economy somehow is soft. That's not true. The border problem is Joe Biden's problem. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  That's not true either. Joe Biden has led a solution that Republicans have stopped. So in some [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=248.8s)]
*  ways, I think posture as is important as policy, be unapologetically on offense and rope the dope [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=253.84s)]
*  Republicans like you did Rick Scott on Medicare last year because the issues and the positions [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=260.8s)]
*  are on Joe Biden's side. But right now, Republicans have gotten away with a high dose of negative [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=266.16s)]
*  partisanship and Joe Biden's job between now and November is to continue to turn the tables [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=271.36s)]
*  on Republicans. You have Biden delivered a strong showing in last year's state again. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=276.4s)]
*  David, lastly, do you think that Biden himself tonight, would you advise him? Should he go [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=280.32s)]
*  right after Trump directly by name, calling him out on what he's done before and plans to do in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  a possible second term? Look, I think I'm in the minority. I don't think he should mention [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=288.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, and I don't think he needs to. A strong defense of democracy, a strong defense [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=293.44s)]
*  of kitchen table issues, a growing economy for all people draws a natural contrast with Donald Trump. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  I've been with the House 25, 30 years. I'm a bit of an institutionalist. Tonight is not a campaign [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=303.76s)]
*  speech. Let the contrast of the issues work for itself. It will be clear that you're also [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  isolating Donald Trump and his vision for the country versus yours. Yeah, President Biden will [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=315.52s)]
*  hit the campaign trail right after the speech tonight. He's got stops in battleground states [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=320.4s)]
*  of Pennsylvania and Georgia. Next couple of days, more travel planned for next week. Certainly a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  high stakes speech tonight, one that his voters believe can help change some of the narrative [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=330.0s)]
*  around Biden. And as you say, David, really draw contrast with MAGA Republicans. Former Republican [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=334.24s)]
*  Congressman David Jolly of Florida, thank you for joining us this morning. We'll be reading your [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=339.6s)]
*  latest piece for MSNBC.com. Please come back soon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=343.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc4RFohk1vY&t=360.0s)]
