# Arnold Schwarzenegger's last act
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w)
*  Schwarzenegger was recently profiled in the Atlantic in a piece titled Arnold Schwarzenegger's Last Act. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=0.0s)]
*  What happens when the Terminator turns 75. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=5.8s)]
*  In it, he talks about his life, his marriage to Maria Shriver, his hope for politics, and more. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=8.8s)]
*  And joining us now, Arnold Schwarzenegger. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=14.5s)]
*  No, actually, wait. I've been misinformed. It's the author. It's the guy who wrote about Arnold Schwarzenegger. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=17.7s)]
*  Staff writer of The Atlantic, Mark Lebovich Lebo. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=21.5s)]
*  We kid because we love. We're really glad you're here, though. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  I read the piece yesterday. It's fantastic. I recommend everyone to do the same. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=26.6s)]
*  Just give us a little bit of your impressions about where Schwarzenegger is in his life, as you put it, Arnold in winter and how he views himself right now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=30.5s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. And this struck me when I decided to write about him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=39.8s)]
*  You know, he's had this incredible sort of concoction of American celebrity. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=43.2s)]
*  He just he basically invented the sport of bodybuilding. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=47.1s)]
*  He became, you know, really one of the top box office people in Hollywood of all time after that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=51.2s)]
*  And then, you know, decided to go into politics. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=56.9s)]
*  You know, first try gets to become governor of California. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=58.9s)]
*  And, you know, it's really known in every corner of the world. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  And I turned around one day last year and I saw that he had turned 75 years old. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=64.8s)]
*  And this was jarring. I mean, people get old. We know this. People die. We know this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=69.5s)]
*  But I'm like, wow, this is really like a comic book god who just didn't. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=74.6s)]
*  He seemed to be like above the sort of contours of time and space. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=79.9s)]
*  And now all of a sudden he's getting old. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=83.7s)]
*  No one to sort of see what he wanted to do next. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=85.0s)]
*  And really, this latest chapter has been just as fascinating. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=87.4s)]
*  He's been returning to, you know, he went to Auschwitz and I went with him and he's sort of been touring the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  And he's been putting out all these anti hate videos and anti Nazi videos. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  And he gave another big speech this week that just has gotten like tens of billions of views warning. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=101.30000000000001s)]
*  Basically, you know, some far right activists around the world, but particularly across America don't go down the path that my father did. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  And his father fought with Hitler in World War Two. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  And anyway, it's one of the most fascinating American lives I've ever seen. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=118.8s)]
*  And I was just sort of interested in tagging along in his journey for a while. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=122.5s)]
*  He also, of course, is strongly condemned the Russia's invasion of Ukraine and urged Russian soldiers to walk away from Putin's efforts there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=126.6s)]
*  It seems almost like a fever dream when we think back on it that Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of California, but he was and for a while had pretty good approval ratings. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=134.8s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about how you reflect about his time in office and what Schwarzenegger, he still have hopes for being in public life. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, very much so. I mean, he I mean, he was really one of the first signature celebrity politicians, right? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=148.9s)]
*  He decided, you know, hey, I'll just jump into politics now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=155.10000000000002s)]
*  And so in 2003, there was a recall of Gray Davis, the very unpopular sort of battled governor of the state. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=158.5s)]
*  Arnold jumps in and lo and behold, he's the new governor of California. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=164.5s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, he was one of the hottest political figures in the country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=167.4s)]
*  And he spoke for, you know, the Republican Convention in 2004. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=171.4s)]
*  He married into the Kennedy family. He kind of transcended a lot of normal political boundaries. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=174.9s)]
*  And he was reelected by 17 points in, I think, 2007 or 2000, whatever, after his first term. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=180.5s)]
*  And then, you know, he was term limited after 2010. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=187.7s)]
*  And he kind of needed a next act. And then he had a terribly scandalous end to his marriage. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=190.5s)]
*  He had an affair with a family housekeeper. He fathered a child with her that he didn't, you know, he had never acknowledged to Maria. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=196.3s)]
*  The marriage breaks up and he's been kind of casting around for a next act. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=203.5s)]
*  And what's interesting is the Trump years have kind of given him one. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=207.6s)]
*  And he has been kind of seen as an honest broker, someone who actually can speak to Russians when they invade Ukraine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=211.3s)]
*  I mean, someone who knows Vladimir Putin, someone who can speak to white nationalists or try to. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=219.1s)]
*  He just has this odd transcendent credibility that I think has his real application in this day and age. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  And you certainly mentioned one of the first celebrity politicians, another one back in the news this week, Donald Trump, of course, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=229.4s)]
*  seemingly with a few different data points, the CPAC speech, some of the polls in New Hampshire and including what we're seeing on Fox News [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=235.4s)]
*  with its efforts to whitewash what happened on January 6, an effort potentially to help Trump going forward. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=241.9s)]
*  Still the dominant figure in the Republican Party. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=247.4s)]
*  And Mark, you cover them so well and so extensively. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=249.5s)]
*  Just give us your impressions of where things are right now in this arc of Trump in the GOP. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, what's interesting is that the arc is somewhat similar to what it has been. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=258.7s)]
*  I mean, Trump, just sort of as he has since 2015, has this iron grip on the party. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=262.6s)]
*  And it just takes all of these different iterations over the years. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=268.6s)]
*  And now we see just the absurdity of the sort of the disingenuousness between what people on Fox will say on the screen based on how they really feel [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=272.5s)]
*  or what Kevin McCarthy and Lindsey Graham will say privately versus what they'll say publicly. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=283.0s)]
*  Same goes for January 6 vaccines and then go up and down the list. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=289.09999999999997s)]
*  But it all sort of begins from the reality distortion field that Donald Trump has really defined his life with and really defined Republican politics with. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=293.4s)]
*  And that's sort of where we are today. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=302.4s)]
*  Staff writer at The Atlantic, Mark Leibovitz. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  It's a great piece. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=306.9s)]
*  I encourage everyone to read it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  And Mark, we'll thank you for being with us today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=308.9s)]
*  We'll see you again a little later on Morning Joe. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0w7sLbSh4w&t=310.9s)]
