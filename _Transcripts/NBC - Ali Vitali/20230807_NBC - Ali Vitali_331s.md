# Democrats overperforming in 2023 special elections: Report
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI)
*  When it comes to special elections this year, Democrats are feeling pretty optimistic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=0.0s)]
*  ABC News reports that an analysis from 538 shows that Democrats have outperformed the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=5.68s)]
*  partisan lean in 38 special elections so far this year, a trend they certainly hope extends to the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=12.16s)]
*  2024 presidential election. Last month, the Democratic candidate in a Wisconsin state [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=18.96s)]
*  assembly election lost by just seven points in an area where Republicans have a 22-point advantage [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=25.76s)]
*  and where Trump beat Biden by nearly 17 points in 2020. In May, the Democrat in a New Hampshire [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=32.24s)]
*  special election for a state House seat won by 43 points, nearly doubling the party's estimated [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  23-point advantage in that district. So according to the report, operatives from the left and the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=46.96s)]
*  right believe the recent success by Democrats can be tied to public support for abortion access [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=52.72s)]
*  and divisiveness over Donald Trump's possible reelection bid. But Republicans, as you might [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=59.6s)]
*  imagine, warned not to read too much into the special elections and for what they might mean [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=65.6s)]
*  for next year. Special elections do typically have lower voter turnout and less money promoting them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=70.4s)]
*  There will be a lot of money in next year's election. Joining us now, White House reporter [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=76.72s)]
*  for the Associated Press, Chris McGarian. Chris, great to see you this morning. So that's some good [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=81.6s)]
*  news for Democrats who are not used to, frankly, feeling good about these things. Democrats tend [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=86.16s)]
*  to worry about election results. And we also, it comes as the White House is really trying to lean [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  in on economic issues, saying, hey, the economy is doing better than polls would suggest. And that's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  going to be one of the themes of the president's trip. He heads out west on a multi-state trip today. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=102.24s)]
*  Talk to us about what we'll hear from him and how the White House is trying to drive this message [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=107.52s)]
*  home. Sure. So President Biden is leaving later today for a few days out west. He's going to be [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=111.52s)]
*  in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. He's got a couple of campaign fundraisers, but this is really [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  a domestic policy victory lap. He'll be talking about climate programs and the Inflation Reduction [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=123.52s)]
*  Act. He's expected to expand a national monument near the Grand Canyon in Arizona. And he's also [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=128.64s)]
*  going to be talking about veterans' health care in Salt Lake City. He's going to visit a veterans [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=135.28s)]
*  hospital there. It's a very important issue for the president personally. And also it's affected [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=139.2s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of veterans around the country who received expanded benefits under the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  law that he signed a year ago. And we should note, of course, Arizona, one of the true battleground [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  states on the map next year. New Mexico sometimes in play, but the president making sure to spend a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  little bit of time there. You mentioned, Chris, veterans' health care. And this week does mark [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  the one year anniversary of the PACDAC becoming law, something also deeply personal for this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=166.08s)]
*  president. And one of the things that the White House really points to as maybe an overlooked [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  accomplishment of the last couple of years, but one they'll certainly be running on next year. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  I know you've got some brand new reporting, some really good reporting where you spoke to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  veterans and their families about the impact of this law. Tell us what you learned. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of the veterans said this law has made an enormous difference in their life. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Some said in the past they used to feel not as positive with the VA. They didn't feel like [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  they were getting the care or the benefits that they deserved. They feel that in recent years [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=197.2s)]
*  that's changed. And under the PACDAC, if you had exposure to burn pits or other toxic substances [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=201.04s)]
*  while serving abroad, you're eligible for expanded benefits. And that money has really changed some [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=207.83999999999997s)]
*  people's lives. They can move into larger homes through families. They can put money away for a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  college, things like that. So it's had a big impact on a lot of people. And for the president, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=218.96s)]
*  his son served in Iraq. And the president always believed that the burn pits in Iraq [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=224.88s)]
*  led to his son's brain cancer. And so for him, there's a policy aspect, but also a personal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=231.44s)]
*  aspect, feeling that he's making progress on behalf of his son as well. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  And Chris, lastly, real quick, the president and his team obviously going to maintain their [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  vow of silence about all the legal issues surrounding Donald Trump. But give us a sense [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=247.6s)]
*  of senior aides you've been speaking to. They have to be pleased here at the contrast as Trump is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=252.72s)]
*  making headline after headline for his legal problems. And meanwhile, the president here [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=257.6s)]
*  doing the people's business. Right. I mean, Biden basically, I mean, the White House is saying that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=261.28s)]
*  Biden's going to keep his head down to keep working on the issues that matter to people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=265.04s)]
*  I mean, getting attention for this stuff is going to be really hard. I mean, the country is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=268.96s)]
*  is riveted by a lot of those legal dramas. It's hard to get people to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=272.64s)]
*  tune in for, you know, ribbon cutting when the president's being, you know, the former president's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=275.68s)]
*  being hauled into court on charges related to January 6. Nonetheless, they hope that this kind [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=280.56s)]
*  of shows that proving the case that Biden laid out to the American people a couple of years ago, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=286.56s)]
*  that he can get things done, that he can have bipartisan accomplishments. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=292.72s)]
*  And his predecessor, former President Trump, is all about himself, all about noise. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  And they hope that holds up next year as well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. White House reporter for the Associated Press, Chris McGarian. Thank you as always. And [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  again, terrific reporting this morning. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=309.36s)]
*  you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToFEjZ6CTOI&t=330.72s)]
