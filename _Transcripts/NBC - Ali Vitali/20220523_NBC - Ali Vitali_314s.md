# Giuliani Met With Jan. 6 Committee For Over Seven Hours
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8)
*  On Friday, former President Trump's one-time lawyer Rudy Giuliani sat for a lengthy interview [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=0.0s)]
*  with the House Select Committee investigating January 6th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=6.4s)]
*  People familiar with the closed-door interview tell the New York Times the meeting was virtual [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  and lasted more than seven hours. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  It's unclear what Giuliani told the committee, but because of his efforts to help overturn [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=15.88s)]
*  the results of the 2020 election, he could potentially be a pivotal witness for the panel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=20.66s)]
*  Giuliani was one of the last major witnesses the committee had pushed to speak with before [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=26.56s)]
*  holding public hearings next month. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=31.32s)]
*  Giuliani also had an eventful appearance yesterday at a parade in Manhattan, shouting at people [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=34.72s)]
*  watching him walk by. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, the reporter who first broke the story about Giuliani's testimony, congressional [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=40.92s)]
*  reporter for The Guardian, our friend Hugo Lowell. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Hugo, you don't have to weigh in on Giuliani's parade adventures or misadventures if you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=48.4s)]
*  don't want. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=52.68s)]
*  Tell us about the committee and how significant his testimony appears to be. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=53.96s)]
*  Well, Giuliani, I mean, for seven hours, he talked to the committee. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=58.96s)]
*  That is not a deposition where you're invoking the Fifth Amendment, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=62.28s)]
*  The Fifth Amendment depositions have been about one hour, two hours long. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=65.56s)]
*  People like John Eastman come to mind. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=69.12s)]
*  Giuliani, on the other hand, does have a lot to say. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  And when we were first reporting on the negotiations that his lawyer was having with the select [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=74.0s)]
*  committee in terms of his appearance, it was all about, does he appear pursuant to a subpoena [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=78.6s)]
*  because he thinks the select committee is illegitimate? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=83.28s)]
*  You know, is he going to talk about matters related to Trump? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=85.24s)]
*  And the final agreement, as far as I understand, is that he was not going to talk about matters [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=88.0s)]
*  covered by executive privilege. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=93.56s)]
*  So that pursues Trump, but it includes everything else. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  So people like Republican members of Congress, what he was doing with other operatives in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=98.08s)]
*  Trump's circle, you know, those conversations not protected by executive privilege are [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=103.16s)]
*  supposed to have been fair game. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  So that is actually quite expansive. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=108.52s)]
*  And I think that could explain why he was there for seven hours. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we'll certainly be watching to see what he had to say. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  You've also got some news. We know the House select committee is expected to hold some [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=115.08s)]
*  public hearings coming up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=118.48s)]
*  You've got new details. What can you tell us? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So now it's going to be six hearings. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=121.4s)]
*  It was originally eight. They keep chopping and changing and it's still subject to change. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=123.12s)]
*  But they're trying to achieve two things. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=126.72s)]
*  First of all, they want to show how Trump or how they believe Trump broke the law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=129.0s)]
*  That's number one. The second thing they're trying to do is effectively connect the dots [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=133.0s)]
*  between the political plan that Trump had to stop the certification and the violence [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=137.2s)]
*  at the Capitol perpetrated by the ministry groups. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=142.48s)]
*  And to that end, they're going to have these top investigators, these top committee councils [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=144.32s)]
*  leading the questioning of the witnesses, which is a really notable point, because normally [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=148.76s)]
*  in congressional hearings, you have members doing the questioning and grandstanding [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=152.04s)]
*  and making these comments. But it's all going to be done by these committee councils who [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  are formerly career prosecutors who really know the material inside out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  And they're going to be focusing on the chronological development of Trump's schemes keeping office, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  this 65 day period from election night to January 6th. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=170.16s)]
*  And that's how they're going to wrap these hearings together. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  And at the very end, I think they're going to focus on the militia groups. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=175.88s)]
*  And that's really significant because they're all being indicted for citizen conspiracy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=179.2s)]
*  And they've been saying for a while these would be, of course, be televised. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  Any other details you can add about sort of the quote theatrics of this? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  Like, how do they want to make and sell the presentation to grab the American public's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=189.48s)]
*  attention who have sort of lived with January 6th for a while now? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=193.44s)]
*  How can they get them to sort of grab them and say, look, this is really important. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=196.8s)]
*  This matters. Well, it's all about the presentation factor, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=199.92s)]
*  They're going to have these witnesses testifying. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=203.48s)]
*  And at the same time, the idea is to have committee council flash through these photos [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=205.52s)]
*  and these text messages and these video that they have pulled from different sources to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=209.96s)]
*  really illustrate and kind of vividly bring to life that testimony. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=213.64s)]
*  And it's all going to be this presentation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=218.0s)]
*  It's big and heavy on the audio and the visual elements of it because they don't want the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=219.52s)]
*  American public to get bored. Some of these hearings, you know, the first and the last [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=222.88s)]
*  are going to be in prime time. The other four in the middle, as of the current schedule, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  are going to be at 10 a.m. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=229.28s)]
*  But, you know, they're going to be lengthy affairs between an hour and a half and two [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=230.44s)]
*  and a half hours depending on the hearing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=233.76s)]
*  And so they want to keep the American public's attention on what was actually being done. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  And so it's going to be a very it's almost going to be like a documentary in some ways. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=241.72s)]
*  And of course, there is a political aspect to this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  And we'll see what sort of impact it may have. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=246.84s)]
*  Former President Trump, as we head in November in the midterms. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=248.88s)]
*  Hugo Lowell, thank you for all this terrific reporting and for being with us today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=251.52s)]
*  Up next, we're going to go live to Indianapolis, where the first overseas shipment of desperately [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  needed baby formula has arrived. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  And coming up on Morning Joe, tension in eastern Asia this morning as the White House has had [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  to clarify comments from President Biden, who said the U.S. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=268.04s)]
*  military will defend Taiwan if China invades. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, a massive 40 billion dollar aid package is off the president's desk and on [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=274.92s)]
*  its way to Ukraine. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=280.0s)]
*  We'll discuss all of this with chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=281.12s)]
*  Adam Smith. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  He'll be a guest. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=286.68s)]
*  Morning, Joe. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  Just a few minutes away. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_1h2_M4RK8&t=288.12s)]
