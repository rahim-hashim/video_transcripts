# More GOP lawmakers show loyalty to Trump at his trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4)
*  Donald Trump was flanked in court yesterday by his largest group of allies yet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=0.0s)]
*  There were about 20 people in his entourage, many of them House Republicans, you can see [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=5.24s)]
*  a few there in the back, who joined him despite the fact that the lower chamber, i.e. their [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=9.76s)]
*  job, was in session. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  In fact, House Republicans were at risk of ceding control of the floor because of those [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=18.28s)]
*  11 lawmakers who were in New York instead of at the Capitol. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=23.32s)]
*  The group of far-right Republicans showed their loyalty to Trump outside the courthouse, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=27.68s)]
*  holding a news conference where they repeated many of the former president's false claims. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=31.96s)]
*  This is the way we've seen this now a few days in a row now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=36.76s)]
*  Trump has a way of getting around the gag order. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=39.0s)]
*  He doesn't violate it, he just has his Republican colleagues do it for him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=41.24s)]
*  Joining us now, a special correspondent at Vanity Fair and host of the Fast Politics [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=45.04s)]
*  podcast, Molly John Fast. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  She's also an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=52.6s)]
*  I mean, let me just set you up here to talk about this display, this sycophance. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=55.16s)]
*  And then we also had Matt Gaetz quoting what Donald Trump said to the Proud Boys in that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  debate, stand back, stand by, in a tweet where he basically said, look, there it is, standing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=66.56s)]
*  back and standing by, Mr. President, said Matt Gaetz as he stands behind Donald Trump [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=72.4s)]
*  outside trial. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=76.84s)]
*  You know, all of that was incredible. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=78.6s)]
*  And I want to say, like, if you look at Nancy Pelosi, I want to hearken back to when the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=83.16s)]
*  House was normal. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=87.2s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi would never have let that happen, right? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=88.2s)]
*  Because it puts the entire House majority, the one or two seat majority, depending on [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=91.76s)]
*  how you count it, in jeopardy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=97.16s)]
*  No, watching this was such a display. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=99.44s)]
*  Yesterday was Freedom Caucus Day at the Trump trial, and that was the Freedom Caucus crew. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=101.8s)]
*  We had the Speaker of the House this week. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=107.62s)]
*  I mean, it just is what it does. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=110.16s)]
*  And again, we don't know, but the downstream consequences of this, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Democrats could run on this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=118.72s)]
*  House Democrats could say, why is the Speaker of the House at Donald Trump's criminal trial? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=121.44s)]
*  Why is the Freedom Caucus at Donald Trump's criminal trial? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  What does this do for the American people? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=130.44s)]
*  What are they, you know, are they doing their jobs? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=133.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=135.04s)]
*  I mean, the same can be said for, say, Doug Bergen, the governor of North Dakota. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=136.04s)]
*  How is he doing the people's business of North Dakota by appearing on Center Street [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=139.68s)]
*  in Lower Manhattan? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=143.0s)]
*  So, but Bergen is there, of course, because it's part of the deep stakes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=144.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, this is a— Donald Trump clearly in no rush to get this done, and he's demanding [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  displays of loyalty, whether it's in the courthouse or elsewhere. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=152.16s)]
*  You've written about it for Vanity Fair. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Tell us where you think this stands. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=158.4s)]
*  So Donald Trump has lucked into a situation where he has all these people who want to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=160.76000000000002s)]
*  be vice president, all of them completely craven, having no interest in doing anything [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=165.32s)]
*  but trying to appeal to him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=172.0s)]
*  And so since they're trying to appeal to him and since they are hoping to audition for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=174.64s)]
*  the deep stakes, he is able to use them, just like he's using these Republicans to get around [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=179.44s)]
*  the gag order, which is pretty craven. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=184.64s)]
*  He's also using these vice presidential hopefuls as support when he's in court. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=188.12s)]
*  And I mean, I think it's pretty interesting that he has had only one family member, Eric, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=195.4s)]
*  but he's managed to get much of the Republican Party there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=200.16s)]
*  I mean, it's a pretty stark contrast. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=203.08s)]
*  Eric has gone several times now, actually. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=204.72s)]
*  So credit to him, I suppose. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=206.44s)]
*  Let's talk about the other main political event this week, which is the agreement to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=208.88s)]
*  a couple of debates. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=211.72s)]
*  I've got some new reporting out this morning about how the Biden team really spent a lot [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=213.44s)]
*  of time looking at the conditions of the debate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  They were spooked by that scene in town hall that Trump did about exactly a year ago with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=219.32s)]
*  the crowd rallying aside and they said, look, we don't want a crowd there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=223.32s)]
*  We don't want Trump to feed off of it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=226.2s)]
*  But also, we don't want this to turn into a spectacle. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=227.4s)]
*  We want this to become as much as it can be a substantive exchange of ideas. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=229.68s)]
*  How important do you think these debates loom? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=233.84s)]
*  And what does it tell you that we're starting in June? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=236.96s)]
*  Yeah. So it's well, clearly, I mean, you did really good reporting on this earlier in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=239.36s)]
*  the week, too. And look, I think Biden world, this is the presidential debate council has [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=243.6s)]
*  really messed up, right? Because they and Biden world said they were they were done with them [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=249.6s)]
*  because they were not enforcing the rules. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  They were not cutting the mics. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=256.16s)]
*  They were not doing what needs to happen with Donald Trump. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=257.44s)]
*  And Donald Trump is not a normal presidential candidate. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=259.84s)]
*  You cannot have normal presidential debates. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=262.8s)]
*  You have to have checks and balances in there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=264.96s)]
*  So I do think that's smart. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=267.76s)]
*  Look, they're smart to do it in June. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=269.12s)]
*  They have to get the American people to pay attention. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=270.56s)]
*  And I think that is why they're doing it in June. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=273.68s)]
*  And then they have won in September. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=275.76s)]
*  And I also think, like, obviously, Biden is not running against someone who is a normal [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=277.36s)]
*  candidate. So norms in this way, like debate committees, aren't necessarily I mean, I think [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=282.24s)]
*  this is I think they're doing the right thing by just pushing along, having it with CNN and ABC [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=288.72s)]
*  and just doing it as soon as possible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=295.68s)]
*  I think they should do three. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=297.44s)]
*  And certainly the Biden camps through the case has long been once Americans start paying [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=298.48s)]
*  attention and realize this is your choice, Biden or Trump, they'll choose Biden. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=301.68s)]
*  Having a debate this early forces Americans to pay attention. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=304.96s)]
*  You pull Trump into their living rooms. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=308.08s)]
*  Mahjong fast. Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=310.0s)]
*  As always, we'll talk to you again soon. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za9shiVz9L4&t=311.28s)]
