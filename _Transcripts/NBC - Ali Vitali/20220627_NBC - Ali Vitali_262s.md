# 'Stop the Steal' Founder Testifies To January 6 Grand Jury
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE)
*  Ali Alexander, the founder of the so-called Stop the Steal group, testified Friday before [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=0.0s)]
*  a grand jury about his involvement in rallies supporting former President Trump ahead of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=6.34s)]
*  January 6th. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  His testimony, which lasted nearly three hours, came after a grand jury subpoena in April, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=13.34s)]
*  seeking information and documents related to Trump's post-election events. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=18.34s)]
*  In a statement, Alexander wrote he is assured that he is not a target of the investigation, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=23.1s)]
*  but a, quote, fact witness. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=28.46s)]
*  Alexander is the latest figure associated with the events from January 6th to face scrutiny [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=31.34s)]
*  from federal prosecutors. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=36.08s)]
*  Joining us now, Seer Politics reporter for Insider, Camila De Chalas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=37.980000000000004s)]
*  Camila, great to see you again this morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=42.38s)]
*  What more do we know about what Alexander said? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=45.0s)]
*  What kind of information were prosecutors looking to get from him? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  So Alexander didn't provide a lot of details, exactly what he told federal prosecutors, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=53.3s)]
*  but he did note that he spoke to the January 6th committee six months prior about his interactions [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  with Republican lawmakers and exactly his involvement in the rallies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=64.74s)]
*  Camila, we're having a little trouble hearing you. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=70.5s)]
*  Let's stop for one second and try again. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=72.94s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=75.3s)]
*  You know, the Europe, the Australia-DC connection is not what it used to be. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=76.3s)]
*  Let me try again, and hopefully we have your audio there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=79.66s)]
*  Give us a sense of what you were saying about what prosecutors were trying to get from Ali Alexander. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=82.94000000000001s)]
*  So Alexander didn't provide a lot of information, exactly, about what he told federal prosecutors, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=87.62s)]
*  but what we do know is that he met with the January 6th committee six months prior to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=92.86s)]
*  his testimony, his talking to the grand jury, and we know that he talked about his conversations [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=97.34s)]
*  that he had with Republican lawmakers leading up to the January 6th insurrection and exactly [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=103.54s)]
*  all the rallies he coordinated before the insurrection took place. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=109.5s)]
*  And that's very pivotal because, as you know, during the January 6th committee hearings, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=113.78s)]
*  there was a lot of testimonies about how Republican lawmakers requested presidential pardons following [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=118.06s)]
*  the insurrection. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=124.14s)]
*  And so he has assured reporters that, you know, he is fully cooperating as a witness, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=125.26s)]
*  that he was not directly involved in the insurrection, and his role was to de-escalate what transpired [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=132.26s)]
*  in the insurrection. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=138.86s)]
*  But it's very telling about what federal prosecutors are doing to ramp up their investigation into [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=139.62s)]
*  the insurrection. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=143.86s)]
*  Camille, let's also turn now to the January 6th hearings. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=146.7s)]
*  They've been so compelling to this point. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=149.86s)]
*  They're taking a little bit of a break. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=152.14s)]
*  Those in the committee saying they need more time to gather more information. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=153.62s)]
*  Also, though, AIDS has suggested that they they knew this would be a busy news cycle with [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=157.62s)]
*  the two European summits and the expected Supreme Court decisions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=161.82s)]
*  But we're going to have at least one, likely two more, hearings in the weeks ahead. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=166.06s)]
*  What's been your assessment of the case that they've made so far? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=169.54s)]
*  Throughout these hearings, you have heard direct testimonies about how Trump was directly [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=173.34s)]
*  involved in an attempt to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  You heard direct phone conversations that Trump had with GOP officials at pressuring them [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=183.06s)]
*  to try to overturn the presidential results. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=189.26s)]
*  The latest hearing you heard former DOJ officials talking about their meetings with Trump, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=192.38s)]
*  about how Trump asked them to hold meetings to issue press releases, stating or even sending [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  a letter to Georgia state legislators, requesting asking them and telling them that they had [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=204.54s)]
*  evidence of voter fraud despite not having any evidence of it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=209.89999999999998s)]
*  And so what you'll see in these next hearings, then I've talked to Benny Thompson, the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  chairman of this committee, is them presenting more evidence about Trump's direct role in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=218.01999999999998s)]
*  trying to stir and prompt a insurrection on Capitol Hill to overturn the presidential [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=223.34s)]
*  election result. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and AIDS has certainly telegraphed that when the hearings do resume, they have a lot [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=229.94s)]
*  more compelling evidence and testimony to present. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=233.94s)]
*  Insiders, Camila Deshalis, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV37FojmVeE&t=236.94s)]
