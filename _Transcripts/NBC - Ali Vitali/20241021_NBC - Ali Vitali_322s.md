# Liz Cheney joins Harris on campaign trail Monday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=0.0s)]
*  Former Congresswoman Liz Cheney will be again joining forces with Vice President Kamala [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=3.08s)]
*  Harris in an effort to win over Republican voters. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=7.12s)]
*  Today the pair will be visiting suburban counties in three battleground states, Pennsylvania, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Michigan and Wisconsin, to hold what the Harris campaign has called moderated conversations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=15.56s)]
*  Some of those Republicans in those areas voted for Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=22.2s)]
*  before she dropped out of the race. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=28.16s)]
*  Joining us now to offer a preview, White House reporter for Bloomberg, Akaila Gardner. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=31.36s)]
*  Akaila, good to see you again. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=35.16s)]
*  So let's talk about this push here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  We've got a lot of it from the Harris campaign here in the final stretch of the campaign [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=39.44s)]
*  in terms of trying to win over some of those disaffected Republicans, the Republicans who [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=44.24s)]
*  voted for Nikki Haley, those who may have cast their ballot for Trump once, maybe even [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=49.0s)]
*  twice but aren't sure they want to do it again. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  We'll be back out there with Cheney again today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=56.6s)]
*  Has the Harris campaign seen any results so far? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=59.52s)]
*  Yeah, well Harris today is going to those three battleground states, the Blue Wall, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=62.4s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and she's really going to counties where Trump saw a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=68.48s)]
*  significant decrease in his support from 2016 compared to 2020 and where Nikki Haley got [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=72.68s)]
*  between 14% and 33% of the vote in the primary. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=78.92s)]
*  So they really see these counties as ripe for people who are disaffected by Trump, people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=83.0s)]
*  who would have liked to see Nikki Haley as a nominee and they're using Liz Cheney, someone [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=87.32s)]
*  who has been very outspoken about the findings at that January 6 committee and they're also [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=91.72s)]
*  using these conservative media hosts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  So they're really trying to appeal to people who just personally do not like Donald Trump [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=99.52s)]
*  and it really could be the difference between people staying home or casting a ballot for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=104.76s)]
*  I talked to Jeff Timmer of the Lincoln Project and he believes that less than 100,000 Republicans [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=109.72s)]
*  could impact the race and battleground states and that group is really targeting these groups [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=116.2s)]
*  with digital ads, really marketed targeting people to about a 1 million voters and they [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=121.32s)]
*  believe if they can get 10% of those people to back Harris that will be crucial because [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=125.92s)]
*  if people could stay home in their words that could be aiding Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=130.36s)]
*  But something that's potentially difficult here as Frank Luntz has pointed out, he's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=134.72s)]
*  a Republican pollster, is that democracy rhetoric doesn't always resonate with these groups. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=138.6s)]
*  They feel like it could be politically not credible and so they really question some [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  of this rhetoric from Harris but at the same time Harris and Liz Cheney have really leaned [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=148.2s)]
*  into this issue of painting Donald Trump as a threat to democracy and that is something [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=152.2s)]
*  that could still motivate base voters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=156.88s)]
*  Yeah and certainly in a race that's expected to be so close, you know, even taking a sliver [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=158.88s)]
*  of those Republican voters matters and like a lot of what Harris and her running mate [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  are doing are going into Republican counties to try to reduce the margin of defeat thinking [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=168.26s)]
*  that will help the overall total. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  But Akaila, my question to you is some Democrats think, though they applaud that strategy, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  but they think that Harris is not doing enough to win over the base, particularly in the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  big cities, places like Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburgh and perhaps especially Philadelphia. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  What's their response? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=186.89999999999998s)]
*  Well right now they believe that this small slice of undecided voters that Republicans [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  could be making up a very large portion of that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=193.26s)]
*  But that's right, Jonathan, I've heard this criticism from Democrats as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=196.1s)]
*  They want to make sure that they're turning out people of color, young voters and these [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=199.7s)]
*  democracy attacks is something that could help people get off the top. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  If they can convince people that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and that casting [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  a ballot for Harris is the right thing to do, then that could potentially help them [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=211.38s)]
*  get over the edge, especially in battleground states where those populations are really [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=215.56s)]
*  important. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=219.74s)]
*  So staying on the base, you just kind of hinted at it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=220.74s)]
*  There's a lot of debate this year about the right way to appeal towards black men. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=222.78s)]
*  We know the Trump campaign believes they've made significant inroads. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=227.72s)]
*  Polling, let's be clear, shows Harris still has a huge advantage, but less of one than [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=231.68s)]
*  previous Democratic presidential candidates. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=235.48s)]
*  What's the Harris team's close arguments to black men here in the last two weeks? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=238.04s)]
*  Well, we saw Harris do this interview with Charlamagne the God, who is really a popular [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=241.66s)]
*  host and someone who has been critical of her in the past. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=245.98s)]
*  He has endorsed her, but Democrats are very concerned about this polling that they're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=248.7s)]
*  seeing with both black men and Latino men with if Trump gets the sort of polling numbers [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=252.78s)]
*  that we have seen so far, he could have the most support from these groups than any Republican [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=257.94s)]
*  really since the Civil War. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=263.82s)]
*  So this is a huge warning sign for Democrats, and they're really hoping that these polling [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=265.02s)]
*  numbers don't play out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=268.38s)]
*  But these are groups that could be important in places like Georgia, like North Carolina, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=270.14s)]
*  where Harris is not looking as strong right now, but she really could need to pick up [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=274.0s)]
*  some of those states if she does not win all three of the Blue Wall states. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  And we are seeing here in the closing stretch of the campaign a real focus from Harris on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=281.6s)]
*  those three Blue Wall states. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, she's spent some time in Georgia, spent some time in North Carolina, a little [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=287.92s)]
*  bit less out west. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=291.12s)]
*  Arizona feels like it might be slipping away. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=292.12s)]
*  Nevada, we know, will be tight. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=294.68s)]
*  But I think we should expect the vice president to basically live in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=296.36s)]
*  and Michigan these next two weeks. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rccTmbkq-Bs&t=299.8s)]
