# Speaker Johnson announces plan to take on DOJ after Trump conviction
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson's laying out a plan to take on the Justice Department following [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's conviction last week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=5.26s)]
*  During a news conference yesterday, Johnson announced a three-pronged approach to curb [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  the DOJ's authority using legislation, congressional oversight, and the appropriations process. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=12.26s)]
*  In his remarks, Johnson accused Democrats of orchestrating Trump's many legal issues [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=19.7s)]
*  in order to prevent him from winning in November. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=25.0s)]
*  When the verdict came down against President Trump, there was something palpable that happened [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=29.22s)]
*  around the country. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=33.22s)]
*  People realize that we have reached a new low. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=34.22s)]
*  And when you have activist prosecutors and the Democratic Party, who are so desperate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=37.4s)]
*  because of the presidential campaign and the way it's going, they understand that Donald [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=42.36s)]
*  Trump, though all the polling shows, is crushing Joe Biden. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=45.58s)]
*  They're in panic mode. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=48.94s)]
*  They see this happening, and they're so desperate to stop him that they are willing to use the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=50.44s)]
*  judicial system to do so. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=54.64s)]
*  It is a new low, and it's a dangerous one, because what they're doing is they're eroding [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=56.98s)]
*  the people's faith in our system of justice itself. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=61.62s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC contributor and author of the book, How the Right Lost Its Mind, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=66.42s)]
*  our friend Charlie Sykes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=71.78s)]
*  Charlie, let's start by fact-checking the speaker there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=73.1s)]
*  Almost all of what he just said is not true. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=75.38s)]
*  But I'll give you the floor and just weigh in here about your analysis of what he had [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=78.14s)]
*  to say and its impact on Americans' faith in our system of justice. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=83.86s)]
*  Well, it is interesting how congressional Republicans are all in on this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was, as you point out, erroneous. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=92.9s)]
*  It was demagogic, but also an indication of the way that the Republican Party is all in, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=96.22s)]
*  not just in supporting Donald Trump in spite of his criminal behavior, but embracing his [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=102.62s)]
*  attacks on the criminal justice system. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=110.5s)]
*  So they're all in on obstruction of justice, possibly trying to shut down the Department [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=113.06s)]
*  of Justice, which they won't be able to do, but also Donald Trump's pledges of vengeance [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=118.42s)]
*  and retribution. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=124.34s)]
*  And I think that, Jonathan, one of the tasks that we sometimes have here is not to become [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=126.38s)]
*  numb to all of this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=131.8s)]
*  It is one thing to say that Donald Trump has turned the Republican Party into a cult, but [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=133.54s)]
*  the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed itself from the party of law [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=141.18s)]
*  and order to the party of we will defend Donald Trump at all costs is really, really remarkable. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=145.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  And we're seeing here Johnson talk about stripping DOJ funding. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's defunding the police, if you will, which of course was the attack Republicans [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=158.3s)]
*  used a few years ago. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=162.22s)]
*  So, Tari, let's dig into this a little further. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=163.22s)]
*  I know you did in your new piece on Substack with the headline Trump's Cheerleaders for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  Vengeance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=169.9s)]
*  Tell us a little more about this dynamic and compare it, if you will, to what we saw in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  2016 when that Hollywood Access tape dropped and now the evolution of the Republican Party [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=176.22s)]
*  from the response there to the response now after the verdict. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, this was something that I had originally written for the Atlantic Daily Newsletter. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=185.38s)]
*  You could really think of last Friday as a bookend for the transformation of the Republican [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=190.34s)]
*  Party. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=194.86s)]
*  You know, back in October 2016 after Access Hollywood, there was at least some soul searching. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=195.86s)]
*  I mean, they didn't find anything there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=200.74s)]
*  But there was there was a decent interval where Republicans said, can we go along with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=202.3s)]
*  this sort of behavior? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=207.5s)]
*  Now, you know, fast forward to what we saw last week, there was no hesitation whatsoever. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=208.9s)]
*  It felt as if all of the statements of support were were prewritten. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=214.34s)]
*  And then again, the number of prominent Republicans and conservatives who basically said that, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=218.62s)]
*  you know, that not only is it wrong that Donald Trump was prosecuted, but we now need to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=224.18s)]
*  go after Democrats. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=229.94s)]
*  And so it is this, you know, it's sort of easy to think of this as as just Trump's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=231.78s)]
*  vindictiveness when he says, I am your retribution. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=238.06s)]
*  But I think what's increasingly obvious is that he has a substantial constituency for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  the politics of retribution and that his base will be demanding it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  And as you're seeing from Speaker Johnson, there's a very real possibility that Republicans [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=250.26s)]
*  will in fact support a Trump 2.0 presidency of vengeance. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=254.82s)]
*  So let's take another look at the aftermath of the verdict, which is covered sort of the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=260.17999999999995s)]
*  hard right Republicans. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  But let's get your read on how it's playing with average voters, sort of those independents [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=265.62s)]
*  and swing voters. We see a little movement in the polls, not a lot, at least not yet. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=270.7s)]
*  But you're in Wisconsin, you're talking to people each and every day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=274.5s)]
*  Is this verdict going to resonate even just a little? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  And in a close race, might that be enough? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=279.82s)]
*  Well, there's there's there's two reactions. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, obviously, the Republican megabase is fired up about this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=285.73999999999995s)]
*  They are angry about this, but they're not the ones who are going to be determining the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=289.3s)]
*  outcome of this election, as you point out. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  And I just I remain incredibly skeptical of the notion that that any felony conviction [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=294.94s)]
*  by Donald Trump and the fact that he continues to face felony charges is in any way a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=301.94s)]
*  political asset going into November. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=306.62s)]
*  I have a hard time imagining independent voters who have been skeptical of him in the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=309.54s)]
*  past saying, yes, we're going to vote for him now, especially as the you know, we're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=313.54s)]
*  now about to have, you know, five months of Democrats in the media describing Donald [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=318.7s)]
*  Trump as a convicted felon. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=323.42s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be a lot of what about ism. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=325.42s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of level that Hunter Biden ism in the weaponization of the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  criminal justice system. But the reality is that Donald Trump's character, his behavior [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=331.14s)]
*  and his fitness for office is is is on the ballot. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  And it is not being portrayed in the most positive light when you have a jury of his [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=341.7s)]
*  peers saying, yeah, he's committed thirty four felonies. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=347.9s)]
*  Yeah. And on a closing note on that, it does seem like there's more and more pressure [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=351.7s)]
*  among Democrats to make this a bigger issue to not just ignore it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=355.38s)]
*  We heard from President Biden at his fundraiser in Connecticut this week talk about it, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  that the Biden campaign Twitter account repeatedly uses the phrase convicted felon. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=362.06s)]
*  As one Democrat had put to me, it's their job to make sure this sinks in. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=367.06s)]
*  That's what the campaign is going to be for. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=372.58s)]
*  Charlie Sykes, thank you so much. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=374.46s)]
*  As always, we really appreciate it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=375.94s)]
*  And thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on this Wednesday morning. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kiayey1uWU&t=377.58s)]
