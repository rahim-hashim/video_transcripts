# 'We cannot win the war with our hands tied behind our backs': Danon on U.S. weapons pause
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg)
*  Israeli officials have responded to President Biden's warning against a full-scale invasion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=0.0s)]
*  of Ra'aafa, for which the U.S. says it will not provide weapons. Speaking to an Israeli [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=5.24s)]
*  news channel, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations deemed the decision frustrating and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  suggested that it was the result of domestic pressure. On social media, Israel's foreign [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=15.24s)]
*  minister vowed to continue fighting Hamas until it's destroyed, adding, there is no [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=20.42s)]
*  more just war than this. However, certain members of Israel's government reacted with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=24.66s)]
*  much harsher criticism. Israel's minister of national security posted this on social [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=29.64s)]
*  media, a tweet that reads, Hamas heart Biden. His office did not immediately respond to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=35.32s)]
*  a request for further comment from NBC News. In a thread also on X, Israel's finance minister [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=41.74s)]
*  suggested the president has set in place an arms embargo while vowing to achieve complete [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=46.44s)]
*  victory despite President Biden's pushback. Speaking with Dr. Phil yesterday in Israel, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=51.36s)]
*  Netanyahu had this to say about Biden's stance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=57.92s)]
*  I think right-minded people, rational-minded people understand that we don't have a choice, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=87.92s)]
*  but there's strong opposition. I've said in the Holocaust memorial service that we had [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=94.0s)]
*  the other day, I said in the Holocaust we stood alone, but we were defenseless. And [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=99.0s)]
*  today, if Israel has to stand alone, we'll stand alone. But we also know we're not alone [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=104.44s)]
*  because we have so many decent people everywhere who do support us, who do understand the truth. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=111.84s)]
*  And we will defeat our enemies and we will secure our future. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=117.74s)]
*  Joining us now, Danny Danone. He is a member of Israel's parliament, the Knesset, and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=124.06s)]
*  former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Ambassador, thank you for joining us [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=128.5s)]
*  this morning. You know, President Biden this week stressed that the U.S. would continue [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=132.34s)]
*  to send defensive weapons to Israel to replenish the Iron Dome and the like, but he's drawing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=136.94s)]
*  the line about giving weapons that would be used for a full-scale invasion of Ra'aq. Let's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=142.18s)]
*  get your own reaction to that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=146.62s)]
*  Jonathan, good morning. First of all, we are disappointed. We are in the middle of a tough [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=148.18s)]
*  war. We are being attacked by many from the north, Hezbollah, from the east, the proxies [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=154.34s)]
*  of Iran, and in the south we're fighting Hamas terrorist organization. And we expect our [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=159.94s)]
*  allies to stand with us when we are in a war. So yes, we are disappointed. You know, we [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=165.1s)]
*  still respect the president. We respect the friendship with the U.S. We will continue [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=170.3s)]
*  the dialogue with our colleagues in D.C., but at the same time, we have no other choice. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=174.78s)]
*  We cannot allow ourselves to stop the war now. And you know, we are a little bit confused [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=180.58s)]
*  also because President Biden said many times that Israel should finish the job and eliminate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=185.02s)]
*  Hamas. So how can we do that with our hands tied behind our back? We cannot win the war [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=190.86s)]
*  without going into Ra'aq, without facing the Hamas battalions who are still there. We have [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=196.82s)]
*  to do that. We have no other choice. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=202.74s)]
*  So the U.S. has said that their concerns about the Ra'aq operation was that Israel, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=204.7s)]
*  it has said that Israel has not provided any sort of plan to provide safety for the civilians [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  there. Is there such a plan? And what is it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=216.38s)]
*  Absolutely. And that's a false assumption because you look at the timeline. We are being [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=220.38s)]
*  gathered for seven months. One of the reasons it's taking us so long because we are very [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=226.7s)]
*  cautious. And before we operate, we allow the population to move to a different direction. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=231.10000000000002s)]
*  And we have shown to our colleagues in the U.S. very specific plans to allow a population in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=236.06s)]
*  the Ra'aq to move to other areas that we are prepared to accept them with the NGOs. And [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=242.86s)]
*  that's why we haven't started the attack there because we will do that before we will attack [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  Ra'aq. And what happened in the last few days, the U.S. changed the tone. If you look back, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=252.94s)]
*  President Biden himself said, we want to see what you are planning to do in Ra'aq. We are not [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=258.3s)]
*  against the operation in Ra'aq. And all of a sudden, I think because of maybe domestic issues, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=263.58s)]
*  the language changed. And all of a sudden we hear, don't go into Ra'aq. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=269.18s)]
*  So on that note, lead national security communications advisor John Kirby told [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=273.26s)]
*  reporters yesterday in a briefing that the administration believes that a major Ra'aq ground [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=279.26s)]
*  operation would actually strengthen Hamas's position at the negotiating table and not [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=284.46s)]
*  Israel's. What's your reaction to that? I beg to differ about that. Look what we [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=291.18s)]
*  are facing now. We have more than 130 hostages. We don't know how many of them are alive, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=297.41999999999996s)]
*  including five Americans. No one knows what's happening to them as we speak. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=303.26s)]
*  So we cannot just wait idly by and expect Hamas to release them. We have no choice. We have to use [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  military force in order to finish the war, in order to eradicate Hamas and release the hostages. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=315.34s)]
*  The very fact that they are not willing to tell us who is alive and who is not. And when we are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  negotiating with them, they say we will release either hostages alive or death. That's not [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=325.73999999999995s)]
*  acceptable. They don't have the decency of actually telling whom from the hostages is still [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=332.78s)]
*  alive. Yeah. And Mr. Ambassador, that's what I wanted to ask next. Does the Israeli government [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  have any sense as to how many hostages are still alive? And can you provide us an update on these [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  ceasefire for hostage negotiations? Where do things stand? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=348.7s)]
*  That's very tough. When we signed the first agreement with Hamas last year, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=353.02s)]
*  they promised to allow the Red Cross visitation to the hostages. It never happened. And today they [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=358.3s)]
*  haven't sent any list about the hostages. So we don't know. But I'm very worried because what we [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=363.66s)]
*  have seen in the last few days, that they are saying that they are not capable of releasing 33 [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  hostages alive. So I'm very troubled by that message coming from Hamas. So we don't have the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=374.7s)]
*  exact number. That's why we have no other option. We are determined to go all the way to release [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=380.86s)]
*  those we can release and to eliminate these terrorist organizations. It's a threat to Israel. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=387.26s)]
*  It's a threat to the U.S. Look, you know, the Iranians are doubling their shipments to the proxies, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=392.53999999999996s)]
*  while the U.S. is stopping the shipment. So we're nowhere near the front line, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=397.65999999999997s)]
*  and we are committed to win this war. Well, we certainly share the hope that those hostages [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=401.5s)]
*  are freed soon and returned to their families. Member of the Israeli Knesset, former Ambassador [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=406.78s)]
*  Danny Danone, thank you for joining us this morning. Thank you very much. Good morning. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5V0ZAFlIg&t=417.26s)]
