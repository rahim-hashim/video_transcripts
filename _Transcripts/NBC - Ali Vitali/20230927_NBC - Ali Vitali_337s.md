# Speaker McCarthy is making a choice to cave, says House member
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk)
*  Welcome back. On Capitol Hill yesterday, the House voted to open debate on four funding bills after facing two failures last week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=0.0s)]
*  However, those moves will likely do little to solve the problem of government funding. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=9.0s)]
*  The legislation backtracks on a top line spending deal brokered by President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy earlier this year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=14.0s)]
*  As the House works to pass those separate bills, McCarthy is still vowing to bring a stopgap funding bill to the floor by Friday, despite several Republican members saying they'd vote against it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=23.0s)]
*  McCarthy, of course, can only afford to lose a handful of votes with the GOP's small majority. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=34.0s)]
*  In the meantime, the speaker is placing blame on why the House can't get a funding bill passed, and he's trying to suggest that it's President Biden's fault. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=41.0s)]
*  Our friend Michael Schnell with a question there. Neat trick trying to blame the president for the messiness in the House. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=71.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jake Ockenclause of the great state of Massachusetts. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=81.0s)]
*  He's a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, as well as the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the U.S. and China. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=86.0s)]
*  So, Congressman, great to see you this morning. Let's talk about what's happening in the House. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=95.0s)]
*  As we noted, a little progress yesterday, only a little. But the House certainly moving on a separate track than the Senate. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=101.0s)]
*  Give us your assessment right now. Where do things stand? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=109.0s)]
*  A government shutdown seems inevitable, and that's because Speaker McCarthy is making a choice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=112.0s)]
*  He is making a choice to cave to his hard right and put his own tenuous hold on political power ahead of the needs of the country. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=119.0s)]
*  In the spring, President Biden came to the table and negotiated a good faith agreement with Speaker McCarthy on how to fund the government for the next year while cutting the debt over the next 10 years. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=128.0s)]
*  And the president is honoring that bargain. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=141.0s)]
*  House Democrats are honoring that bargain. Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats are honoring that bargain. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=143.0s)]
*  It is only Kevin McCarthy who has walked away from it, and he's walking away from it because he has what I call a crocodile caucus. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=148.0s)]
*  And appeaser, Jonathan, is someone who feeds a crocodile, hoping it'll eat him last. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=155.0s)]
*  And Speaker McCarthy is feeding his crocodile caucus. First, the Constitution on January 6th, then the presidency with his impeachment inquiry, then Ukraine with his cut and run strategy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=160.0s)]
*  And the crocodile is still going to end up eating Speaker McCarthy, but he's the last person in Washington to get that joke. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=171.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's pretty clear. So let's talk about the border security mentioned by McCarthy, also Ukraine, as aforementioned, Ukraine funding. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=177.0s)]
*  Would you be willing to set those things aside, at least for now, for a bill that would just fund the government and revisit? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=184.0s)]
*  Or do you think it all needs to be connected? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=189.0s)]
*  Well, it's a false choice because we have the parameters of an agreement to fund the government, not just through a continuing resolution, but for the entirety of the next year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=192.0s)]
*  They negotiated agreement that would trim non-defense discretionary spending, that would modestly increase defense spending. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=201.0s)]
*  And both parties came together in a compromise. It was not a bill that I think a lot of Democrats loved. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=209.0s)]
*  But in the tradition of Washington, put the needs of the country ahead of 100 percent of party aims and did the right thing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=216.0s)]
*  And Speaker McCarthy is walking away from it. All he has to do is go back to the agreement that was already agreed to. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=225.0s)]
*  And lastly, we want to turn to another subject that you care deeply about the blockade put in place by Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of military promotions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=230.0s)]
*  He is now saying he's going to continue it, quote, forever. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=239.0s)]
*  We saw the Senate get a few promotions through last week. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=243.0s)]
*  But is there anything more that Democrats, specifically House Democrats, what can be done or does this simply fall to the feet of Republicans to pressure Tuberville to stop? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=246.0s)]
*  The responsibility for this lies squarely with Senator McConnell. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=256.0s)]
*  It's clear that Senator Tuberville doesn't care about civil military relations or what's best for service members or what's best for the United States national security posture. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=259.0s)]
*  Senator McConnell does claim to care about those things, and he now needs to act and put pressure on his extremist colleague to cease this hold on nominations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=268.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, Jonathan, I'm on the select committee on competition with China. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=279.0s)]
*  I can tell you firsthand, this is a gift to Xi Jinping. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=282.0s)]
*  It is not only eroding our ability to plan for Indo-Pacific scenarios regarding China. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=286.0s)]
*  It's also a public relations coup for him because it highlights dysfunction within Congress at a time when he's trying to claim to his people and to Indo-Pacific countries that the United States is going to be a fair weather friend. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=294.0s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Jake Ockenclaw, a veteran, he represents the state of Massachusetts. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=306.0s)]
*  We really appreciate you being with us this morning. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=312.0s)]
*  We'll talk to you again soon. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=314.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Muq_UtltHuk&t=324.0s)]
