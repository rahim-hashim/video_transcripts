# Trump expected to name Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name longtime aide and immigration hardliner [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=3.36s)]
*  Stephen Miller as his deputy chief of staff for policy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=8.3s)]
*  Trump has not yet announced the pick, but vice president-elect JD Vance appeared to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=12.24s)]
*  confirm the selection in a post on social media. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  According to NBC News, Miller will likely be heavily involved in trying to execute Trump's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=20.32s)]
*  promise to force mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=25.22s)]
*  During Trump's first term in office, Miller was instrumental in Trump's family separation [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  policy, calling it back in 2018, quote, a simple decision by the administration to have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=35.18s)]
*  a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=41.5s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC contributor and author of the book, How the Right Lost its Mind, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  our friend Charlie Sykes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=50.86s)]
*  Charlie, good to see you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=52.26s)]
*  Let's start there with Stephen Miller. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=53.66s)]
*  Obviously, he is a well-known figure from his time in the first Trump administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=55.699999999999996s)]
*  The news yesterday that he's likely to have a prominent West Wing post, one with significant [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=61.419999999999995s)]
*  responsibilities, certainly met with, shall we say, revulsion among some immigrant rights [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  groups and Democrats. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=72.02s)]
*  And it seems to be a pretty strong signal that this mass deportations program is in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=74.3s)]
*  the works, it could potentially happen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=80.1s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=82.82s)]
*  I think there's absolutely nothing surprising about Stephen Miller's role. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=85.05999999999999s)]
*  He really represents the id of MAGA when it comes to the issue of deportation and immigration. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  I was listening to the last segment, and I think that there are going to be moments where [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=96.58s)]
*  you're going to look at appointments and you're going to say, OK, that appointment is reassuring [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=100.94s)]
*  or that person is more mainstream. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  But keep in mind where the real heart of this Trump White House is. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=107.54s)]
*  I mean, and he has signaled it and he's explained it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=112.26s)]
*  He's discussed it over and over again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=114.86000000000001s)]
*  It is people like Stephen Miller at the moment, Elon Musk, the Tucker Carlson's of the world, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  Don Jr. and they are going to be pushing, they're going to be in Donald Trump's ear [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  and they are the ones who are the id of this administration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=127.7s)]
*  There may be others who may be the public face. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=132.46s)]
*  Donald Trump has told us who he is, what he intends to do, and I don't think we should [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=136.2s)]
*  be surprised by any of this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=139.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're so right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=141.6s)]
*  There are certainly some who are not Trump supporters at all, who saw the news of Rubio, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=143.28s)]
*  Suzy Wiles and went, OK, that could have been worse. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=150.28s)]
*  That's a phrase I heard from several people last night. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=153.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=155.72s)]
*  Others, you know, Stephen Miller, I think, confirmed some worse fears. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=156.72s)]
*  You mentioned Elon Musk. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=159.8s)]
*  How do you see that relationship going forward? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=160.8s)]
*  He doesn't have an official position. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=165.48s)]
*  He may never get one. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  We also know that Trump likes to be the sole star in the sky. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  What do you think happens? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=170.84s)]
*  Oh, I think this is going to be one of the most interesting storylines of the next few [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=173.44s)]
*  years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Look, this billionaire bromance is really extraordinary. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  But the problem is there's only room for one, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=182.42s)]
*  There's only room for one narcissistic billionaire. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  And at some point, something's got to give. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  But Elon Musk's role, his prominence in this administration is extraordinary. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=193.32s)]
*  Obviously, Donald Trump wants to keep as close, closely as possible. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=197.96s)]
*  But Elon Musk has made it very clear that he intends to try to do to the federal government [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=201.6s)]
*  what he has done to Twitter. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=205.64s)]
*  I think he'll find that much more difficult. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think it's going to really test the loyalty factor. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=210.4s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump wants, you know, Elon Musk to love him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=212.96s)]
*  But is he going to greenlight every extreme measure that he does? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=217.96s)]
*  This, I think, is where the crunch is going to come. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  So I think in some ways, I think this is almost like a Shakespearean drama. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=225.2s)]
*  You know, what is going to happen between these two men, both of whom think that they [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  are somehow the billionaire genius astride the planet? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=232.56s)]
*  This will end in tears. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=238.88s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=241.72s)]
*  Yeah, we'll note that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=242.72s)]
*  Let's talk about the Congress that Donald Trump is going to be working with when he [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=244.95999999999998s)]
*  comes to office. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=250.16s)]
*  Republicans already have the Senate appear likely to take the House. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=251.2s)]
*  But it's not just the Republicans will have control. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=254.84s)]
*  Is that both of these bodies are far more Trumpified than what we saw when he took office [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=257.12s)]
*  in 2017. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=262.84s)]
*  Talk to us about how you see that dynamic playing out. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  What doors is that open for Trump? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=267.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, all the doors are open for Trump, you know, including getting all of his nominations [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=268.96s)]
*  through. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=274.84s)]
*  However, I think it is interesting that he's fired the first shot against checks and balances [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=275.84s)]
*  by asking or demanding that the Senate Republicans essentially surrender their constitutional [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=279.46s)]
*  responsibility of advice and consent. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=284.78s)]
*  He wants to be able to make recess appointments. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=287.3s)]
*  So what he is basically saying is, look, I don't regard you as co-equal branches of government. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  I want you to do my bidding. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=296.1s)]
*  And so he's demanding complete loyalty. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=298.78s)]
*  Now, how is that going to work? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=301.26s)]
*  We don't know how. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=302.7s)]
*  Will the Senate be willing to surrender one of its core constitutional functions? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=304.86s)]
*  Will Mike Johnson be able to hold together that chaotic caucus? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=310.29999999999995s)]
*  Trump may provide the glue. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  But the margin in the House is going to be very, very narrow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=317.46s)]
*  And Trump clearly is trying to bend the Senate to his will. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=321.53999999999996s)]
*  I think we're going to find out very shortly how that's going to play out when we see who [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=325.41999999999996s)]
*  the Senate selects as its majority leader. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=329.97999999999996s)]
*  The MAGA folks are really pushing very hard for Rick Scott, although there are indications [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  that that may be backfiring. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=338.06s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=339.78s)]
*  Yeah, certainly the Senate, the blind vote, they have some ability to potentially defy Trump. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=340.78s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=345.09999999999997s)]
*  Of course, we all wait to see if Trump does eventually stock his administration with some [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  of the more extreme figures on the right, the Rick Grahels, the Cash Patels, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=349.53999999999996s)]
*  We'll find all that out in the days ahead. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=354.82s)]
*  MSNBC contributor Charlie Sykes. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=356.46s)]
*  Charlie, thank you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=358.14s)]
*  As always, we will talk to you again soon. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgLqmrBao74&t=359.14s)]
