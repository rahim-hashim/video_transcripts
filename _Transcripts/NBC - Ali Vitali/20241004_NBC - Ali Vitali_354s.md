# Liz Cheney campaigns with Vice President Harris
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY)
*  But I say all that to say every time that I've come here recently, one of the conversations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=0.0s)]
*  that we have, all of us together, is how much we love our country and that that really is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=6.08s)]
*  the binding factor in us all being together and taking the time to be together to really [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=12.68s)]
*  just renew and remind everyone of what is at stake, but born out of love that we have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=18.32s)]
*  this fight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=25.12s)]
*  I want to thank you Liz Cheney for reminding us that that regardless of party affiliation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=26.12s)]
*  is a factor that binds us all. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=33.52s)]
*  And so I thank you for your support and your leadership and your courage. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=36.44s)]
*  That was the Vice President praising Liz Cheney yesterday after the former Republican congresswoman [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  delivered remarks and endorsed Harris at their rally in Wisconsin. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=47.16s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC analyst and contributor to the conservative website The Bullwork, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=50.92s)]
*  our friend Tim Miller. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  Tim previously served as communications director for Jeb Bush as well as spokesman for the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=57.56s)]
*  Republican National Committee. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=61.72s)]
*  Tim, you could have made a lot of money about a year ago if you placed a bet on whether [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  Dick Cheney's name would draw applause at a Democratic political rally. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  That happened yesterday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=72.28s)]
*  Talk to us about the importance of Liz Cheney's public support for Harris. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=74.16s)]
*  She's out there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  campaigning with her, setting up potentially a permission structure for other Republicans [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=79.52s)]
*  to cross the island, do the same. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look, it was a powerful moment, Jonathan. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  I was watching it on my little laptop getting kind of emotional. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=88.96s)]
*  It wasn't just Dick Cheney got applause, Mike Pence got applause. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  And you know, there are, I think, some snarky people out there, particularly on the left. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, the Democrats are now all in with the neocons or whatever. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  And that's not what was happening in Wisconsin yesterday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=104.56s)]
*  It was it was Democrats who appreciate the country, as Kamala Harris said there, who [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=107.44s)]
*  have love of country, who were cheering for people that were willing to put country over [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=114.08s)]
*  their political ideals. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=120.08s)]
*  It was not Democrats saying, no, we're on board with the Dick, Liz Cheney and Mike Pence [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=121.28s)]
*  program on abortion and foreign policy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  It was them saying, thank you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=130.38s)]
*  We can also put partisan differences aside for a little bit to welcome you into this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=132.14s)]
*  process and hope that we can save the country together. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=139.16s)]
*  And I think that's what yesterday was about. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=141.94s)]
*  I think that the group that this is the most meaningful for is not swing voters in the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=144.33999999999997s)]
*  traditional sense that they're like deciding between Trump and Harris. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=149.88s)]
*  It is traditional Republicans who do not like Trump, who are not planning to vote for Trump, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=153.7s)]
*  who might not vote at all, who might write in the name at the top of the ballot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=160.44s)]
*  And I think having Liz Cheney there with Kamala Harris saying, you know, a write in is not [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=164.6s)]
*  enough. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=169.36s)]
*  It is this one time it is worth it to actually proactively support the alternative candidate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=170.36s)]
*  because the threat is so great. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=175.8s)]
*  I think that is the important nudge that Liz Cheney is offering. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=177.36s)]
*  And she's kind of alone in doing it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=180.68s)]
*  And there are other less smaller named Republicans, sort of the top name people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  It's pretty striking that she's she's really the one out there doing it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=187.38s)]
*  Yeah, we'll see if that changes the next month. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=190.18s)]
*  Trump himself, by the way, also said the Democrats were trying to rally with the neocons to your [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=191.98s)]
*  to your point. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=197.06s)]
*  Speaking of Trump, he heads back to Butler County, Pennsylvania this weekend. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  And what is a much hyped rally has returned to the site, to the very site of that assassination [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=201.85999999999999s)]
*  attempt over the summer. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=206.5s)]
*  I saw on X this morning, Elon Musk says he'll be there, too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=207.78s)]
*  What do you think that spectacle will be like? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  It sounds like a circus. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=213.9s)]
*  Elon's going to be there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=216.28s)]
*  But look, I mean, I think that Donald Trump obviously was was boosted by this horrific [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=217.88s)]
*  event politically. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=225.56s)]
*  And there's no room for this kind of violence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=227.88s)]
*  And I think that the one positive thing we've seen, maybe the only positive thing we've [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  seen out of the Trump campaign over the last few months is I was kind of expecting more [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=235.0s)]
*  and more. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=240.2s)]
*  There's the old waving of the bloody shirt image. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=241.6s)]
*  I was expecting a little bit more of that, like a little bit more of ramping up the kind [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=244.62s)]
*  of retribution calls. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=250.18s)]
*  We haven't seen that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=252.38s)]
*  I hope we do not see it at that rally in Butler. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=253.38s)]
*  But there's no doubt that will be a spectacle. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=256.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=260.42s)]
*  And Tim, certainly it's another base play. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=261.42s)]
*  And in our last minute or so here, talk to us about that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=262.42s)]
*  There are some those undecided as you just mentioned. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=265.54s)]
*  There aren't too many. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=267.82s)]
*  This really feels like which candidate can get their base the most excited to vote, to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=268.86s)]
*  get out there and do it a month out? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=273.79999999999995s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=276.08s)]
*  I think the anti-Trump coalition is bigger than the pro-Trump coalition. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  We've seen it every time. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=281.64s)]
*  It's a question of what to do in those states. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that Kamala Harris has done a really good job of bringing a lot of core Democratic [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  constituencies back on board. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  But she's not all the way there yet. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think that she's got two things that she's got to do over the next month. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=294.84s)]
*  One is for people who still need to kind of buy in to the fact that she's up for it, continue [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=298.32s)]
*  to make that sale, a proactive sale. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=303.46s)]
*  But also what we saw yesterday with Liz Cheney, motivate people by reminding them how extreme [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=305.9s)]
*  Donald Trump is, what the threat is, what you talked about in the last segment with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=310.98s)]
*  Michael Beschloss, and hopefully use that specter to kind of get that one last nudge [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=314.3s)]
*  to get some folks off the couch who are not fans of Donald Trump. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=322.82s)]
*  And I think that's her big job over the next 30 days. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=326.62s)]
*  30 days to go. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=328.98s)]
*  Contributor to the conservative website, The Bullwork, Tim Miller. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=330.46s)]
*  Tim, thank you. Have a good weekend. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjRZNGq0EpY&t=332.7s)]
