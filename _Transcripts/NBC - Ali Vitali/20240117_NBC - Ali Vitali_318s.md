# Trump expected to attend second day of E. Jean Carroll trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI)
*  Welcome. President Donald Trump is expected to be in a New York federal courtroom again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=0.0s)]
*  this morning to attend the second day of the defamation damages trial involving the writer [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=5.4s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll. Trump was in court yesterday for jury selection but left before opening [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=11.0s)]
*  statements to attend that campaign rally we showed you and we showed you in New Hampshire. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=16.26s)]
*  Already been found liable for defaming Carroll in 2019 while he was president for mocking [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=21.44s)]
*  her sexual assault claim against him. In this trial jurors will be asked to figure out how [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=27.46s)]
*  much money Trump will have to pay in damages. Carroll is expected to testify today. Her [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  team is asking for at least 10 million dollars. 20th now MSNBC legal analyst Danny Savalas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=38.78s)]
*  So Danny Trump continued to defame Carroll and criticize the judge on his truth social [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=46.22s)]
*  account. There was even a split screen where Trump was sitting there in the courtroom but [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=51.66s)]
*  his true social account was still posting about her at the same time. Trump didn't have his phone [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=55.22s)]
*  was clearly a staffer doing it for him. But talk to us about the impact of his continued criticism. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=59.54s)]
*  What could that mean? Well first of all it's always possible that Trump could defame E. Jean [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=65.74s)]
*  Carroll again and since so many of these issues have already been decided through a principle [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=70.94s)]
*  called rest judicata it just means that if the issue has already been decided in litigation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=75.38s)]
*  involving the same parties then you don't have to re-litigate it. And we've seen that in this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=79.58s)]
*  case. It's possible the plaintiffs could even seek to introduce this as evidence of Trump's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=84.38s)]
*  hatred, ill will or spite. And those magic words are things the plaintiffs need to prove in order [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=89.58s)]
*  to establish punitive damages which ordinarily are really difficult to quantify. That's why they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  could be a hundred thousand dollars. They could be ten million dollars. Really what the plaintiffs [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=101.46s)]
*  want here is a number that's big but not so big that the appellate division will overturn it as [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=106.22s)]
*  too big which is a possibility. So Danny I mean Trump is clearly using every courtroom appearance [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=111.94s)]
*  really as a campaign event to rally his supporters and even raise some money. Is there any other [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=117.94s)]
*  strategic reason for him to have been in courtroom yesterday and again he only stayed for part of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=125.3s)]
*  the proceedings coming back today? Is it also an attempt in some ways to maybe try to intimidate [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=129.1s)]
*  Carroll? Possibly or maybe even in I don't want to say intimidate but influence the jury with his [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=133.74s)]
*  mere presence because other than that strategically I can't imagine why a client like Donald Trump [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  would want to be present for trial during jury selection unless it's to kind of subtly influence [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=146.06s)]
*  the jury because otherwise in federal court especially jury selection is mostly run by the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  judge. The attorneys have much less involvement than they do in state court in New York where [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=158.04s)]
*  they're heavily involved. If you're Donald Trump and you really want to attend a trial you attend [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  the actual testimony of witnesses which he may do but look in civil cases there's no requirement [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=167.82s)]
*  for a party to be there every single day and of course logistically it is a big pain for both the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=175.38s)]
*  courts and everybody involved to have a former president come in and attend one of his trials. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  So really ultimately it's not about strategically in terms of helping his case as you suggested at [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=185.38s)]
*  the outset it's probably strategically more politically so for him to attend his case and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=192.54s)]
*  use it as a podium perhaps to speak outside the courthouse. So Danny as mentioned A.G. Carroll will [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=197.64s)]
*  testify today what do you expect we'll hear from her? The effect that these statements and in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=203.42s)]
*  particular the 2019 excuse me the 20 yet the 2019 statements that Donald Trump made about her how [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=210.56s)]
*  they affected her how they damaged her how they caused her pain all of those are factors relevant [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=217.02s)]
*  in determining not only her compensatory damages but also punitive damages and then expect the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=222.78s)]
*  plaintiff to shore that up the plaintiff's team with evidence of Donald Trump's intentional acts [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=228.34s)]
*  in defaming her not that he just did it recklessly but that he did it intentionally to warrant [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=233.5s)]
*  punitive damages. And Danny give us a sense the timeline as to how long this trial will last and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=238.94s)]
*  and you did mention that Trump will have an appeal option if he wants it how long could that take? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=244.9s)]
*  This trial will move very quickly compared to all the other trials that Donald Trump's involved in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=251.18s)]
*  and that's because the issues have been narrowed so significantly we're only talking about damages [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=257.02000000000004s)]
*  here plus we're in federal court which usually moves very efficiently and because there are so [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=263.22s)]
*  many issues removed from the case there are there is very little evidence that needs to be put up [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=268.3s)]
*  and that's why for example Donald Trump will be limited in the amount of evidence that he can put [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=274.22s)]
*  on he will not be allowed to put on evidence that that E. Jean Carroll is lying that this is false [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=278.74s)]
*  that this is a political witch hunt all of that stuff's gonna be out because this is really about [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  damages compensatory and punitive damages. And of course we will have complete coverage of E. Jean [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=289.18s)]
*  Carroll's appearance later today. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vinIQQjUDHI&t=295.74s)]
