# President Biden to host Trump at White House today
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q)
*  President-elect Donald Trump is set to make his return to the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden is scheduled to host Trump this morning at 11 o'clock in the Oval Office. Biden [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=5.2s)]
*  extended the invitation shortly after last week's election results were finalized [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=10.72s)]
*  in keeping of decades of tradition. The meeting highlights his administration's emphasis on a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=15.6s)]
*  peaceful transfer of power. But of course, after 2020, Trump lost his second run and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=21.76s)]
*  broke that precedent. He refused to invite the Bidens to Washington. First Lady Jill Biden also [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=29.04s)]
*  reached out to Melania Trump to meet today, but neither the First Lady's office nor the Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=36.32s)]
*  campaign is confirmed. That visit is actually going to happen. Melania reportedly planning [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=41.36s)]
*  to skip it. She was noticeably absent from the majority of Trump's campaign stops and events, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=45.68s)]
*  but was there the night he was reelected. Before heading to the White House, President-elect Trump [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=50.56s)]
*  is expected to meet with some House Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters yesterday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=56.4s)]
*  that there are preliminary plans for that meeting, but they've not been finalized. Johnson also shared [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=60.16s)]
*  he plans to be at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence this weekend in Palm Beach to iron out details [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=65.44s)]
*  on the plan's end. Joining us now to talk about all this is the director of Syracuse University's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=72.08s)]
*  Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship, Margaret Taleb. She's also a senior contributor [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=78.48s)]
*  for Axios. Margaret, good to see you this morning. So there are so many, so many storylines here for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=83.6s)]
*  this Trump and Biden meeting. This is Trump's first visit to the Oval Office since he slunk [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=89.6s)]
*  out of Washington on January 20th, 2021, two weeks after January 6th's insurrection. Also, he's got to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=96.0s)]
*  sit down next to the man, President Biden, who has spent years calling Trump a threat to democracy [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  and now sees him succeed him. Yeah, Jonathan, I think today is going to be a very watchable [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=109.28s)]
*  moment. There's a lot of optics involved, although I think substantively the President-elect's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=118.48s)]
*  meetings with House GOP lawmakers are probably going to be more important in terms of paving [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=124.48s)]
*  the way for what's to come in the next four years or even the next, you know, four months. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=131.28s)]
*  But as you mentioned, a big part of this tradition is the optics of a peaceful transfer of power, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=137.28s)]
*  and the reason that's been historically important is to signal to American voters, no matter what [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=144.32s)]
*  your view is, that when, you know, the candidate has won, it is the role of the outgoing administration [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=149.36s)]
*  to welcome them to the White House and to help set them up for success. And because President [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  Biden believes in norms and embraces norms, this is something that even though it's going to be [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=162.88s)]
*  obviously very difficult to do, this is a victory lap for President-elect Trump. He's going to come [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=168.16s)]
*  off of this sort of rally atmosphere on the Hill, having won both the popular vote as well as the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  electoral vote and show up at the White House and sort of, you know, it is a win moment for him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=180.64s)]
*  But Biden's, I think, sort of plan in this, traditionally what happens is they also have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=189.44s)]
*  a conversation, the outgoing president and the incoming, and talk about domestic issues. They [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=196.64s)]
*  talk about foreign policy issues, things the outgoing president wants the incoming president to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=200.56s)]
*  know. I think both of them already know what the other one wants them to know. There are very few [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=205.76s)]
*  secrets anymore about what's going on and the different views in these two administrations, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=212.32s)]
*  but that is going to be a big part of what happens today. Famously, Barack Obama in 2016 told Trump [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=218.16s)]
*  to watch out for North Korea, that that might be the biggest international issue he faces. And [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  credit to President Biden here, to adhering to this tradition. He's as personally painful as it [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  will be for him to sit next to Trump in the Oval Office. Margaret, let's get your take on some of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=233.44s)]
*  the Trump selections we heard from last night, particularly Pete Hegseth as defense secretary [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=239.12s)]
*  and Kristi Noem as head of DHS. These are pretty unconventional selections to many. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=244.16s)]
*  What's the analysis you're hearing? Well, I think Hegseth is the one that more folks will be talking [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=249.84s)]
*  about because in addition to some of his background, even though he does have military service, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=255.44s)]
*  he's also been thought of as a partisan media figure on Fox who sort of trolls the woke policies [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=264.88s)]
*  and all this kind of stuff, that there's going to be some controversy on that front. Also, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=272.8s)]
*  some controversy for his support of controversial figures who were in trouble in the military. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=276.48s)]
*  It's one thing to do that from your perch in a media role. It's another thing to do that as [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  defense secretary. And finally, I think his very anti-interventionist stance compared to even some [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=286.16s)]
*  of the incoming folks we expect on Trump's national security or intelligence or foreign policy [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=292.56s)]
*  leadership teams is going to create a conflict most likely right out of the gate. The confirmation [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  process could be quite interesting, but I think President-elect Trump has clearly thought this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=306.4s)]
*  through. This is the move he wants to make for the conversation and the debate as much as for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=311.84s)]
*  a loyalist who is a communicator and is well known by the American public. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=318.96s)]
*  Yeah, Republicans in the Senate likely a rubber stamp for most of his picks. This one maybe not. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=324.55999999999995s)]
*  Margaret Talley, thank you so much. We'll talk to you again soon. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI_N_3YKH7Q&t=328.56s)]
