# Liz Cheney says Republicans wanted her to lie about Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic)
*  Alex earlier in the show we played some video from Liz Cheney the former congresswoman who said that her [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=0.0s)]
*  Ex GOP colleagues in the house wanted her to lie about Donald Trump. What more have you guys learned about that? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely speaking at her alma mater of Colorado College. She went and encouraged [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=14.24s)]
*  Basically said that Republican leaders [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=21.48s)]
*  As you said wanted her to lie in order to keep her position as the number three in the conference essentially [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=24.92s)]
*  she was saying that she faced a choice of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=31.52s)]
*  telling the truth about January 6th and Donald Trump and the insurrection at the Capitol or [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=33.76s)]
*  Keeping her power and that she that in that clear decision. She chose one way or the other [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=39.46s)]
*  Interestingly enough though while she was at that speech about half the college crowd [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=45.64s)]
*  Still turn their backs on her not because our position on January 6th or making that you know brave political decision [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=50.300000000000004s)]
*  But because of her past record on some other Republican issues showing that even if you make that one stand still [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=56.78s)]
*  In this polarized country people people still had diverging opinions [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=64.26s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's a really really good point [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  And this high-profile speech comes amid some speculation as to what Liz Cheney might do next Alex [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  What's the latest there there certainly had been some chatter that she might throw her hat in the ring and run for president [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=76.94000000000001s)]
*  There hasn't been any moves towards that just yet. What do we think she's up to I? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=81.9s)]
*  Mean more than just chatter. She spent a few hundred thousand dollars putting ads on the airwaves in New Hampshire, which [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=86.14s)]
*  Is event there's any state where you'd have sort of one of the quote-unquote never Trump Republicans [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  Really trying to make it make an entry it would probably be in New Hampshire, which has that sort of maverick reputation [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=99.34s)]
*  I think you're going to see her pack which again was what which was the funding mechanism for those ads [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=106.94000000000001s)]
*  They are still planning to spend competitively in that state ahead of the primary now whether or not Liz Cheney is the candidate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=114.42s)]
*  I still think is an open question in Republican [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=121.38000000000001s)]
*  Republican polling shows she is not the most popular member of her own party now [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  I think it's more likely than not you'll see her pack throw their weight behind a different sort of candidate [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=128.58s)]
*  If I already guessed this is pure speculation, but I guess someone like Chris Christie [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=134.66s)]
*  Who's expected to join the race and make New Hampshire a focal point would be much more likely? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=138.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's not quite clear what Cheney's lane would be Mike Pence [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=143.62s)]
*  Also were he to jump in the race the same issues where he made decision about January 6th that so many Republicans opposed [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=146.94s)]
*  And we should note Rhonda Santis makes his debut on the campaign trail today in Iowa his first time as a declared candidate [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=153.18s)]
*  but Alex we want to close with an important new piece of reporting that you guys have at Axios about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=158.62s)]
*  Preserving the stories of the last Holocaust survivors, please tell us about it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes, absolutely [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  essentially we are now in the last generation of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=169.78s)]
*  People who survived the Holocaust and you're seeing museums and other and other groups basically go out of their way to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=173.26s)]
*  memorialize them and make sure that you know the memories of those horrific events are not lost to history [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes, certainly so very very important now more than ever particularly as we see a rise of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=187.62s)]
*  Antisemitism and hate across much of the globe national political correspondent for Axios Alex Thompson [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=193.14s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us this morning [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=198.62s)]
*  You [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQlXknFs7ic&t=217.38s)]
