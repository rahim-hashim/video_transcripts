# GOP senators push Musk to coordinate more with congress on cuts
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M)
*  Welcome back to Way Too Early. It is 530 on the East Coast, 230 out West. I'm Ali Vitali. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=0.0s)]
*  A group of Republican senators in the so-called Doge Caucus met with Elon Musk yesterday, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=15.16s)]
*  pushing for him to coordinate more with Congress on his cuts to the federal government. Politico [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=20.0s)]
*  reports the meeting began with a discussion about retaining important federal employees [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=24.72s)]
*  following the massive firings of government workers. Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=29.12s)]
*  told Musk that it was important for senators to have points of contact within Doge to address [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=33.76s)]
*  concerns from their constituents, of which there have been many. Republicans have generally been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=38.8s)]
*  supportive of Musk's effort to cut down on the federal government and its spending, but some [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=43.92s)]
*  have expressed reservations about the pace. Yesterday's meeting did not include President [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=48.32s)]
*  Trump. Joining us now is Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to President Biden's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=53.36s)]
*  campaign, Alencia Johnson, also with us, former communications director for Republican Senator [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  Cory Gardner, Annalise Keller. Annalise, let's start right there with Elon Musk and the Doge [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=63.12s)]
*  cuts, because I was at a town hall last night, Democratic lawmaker, but kind of a 50-50 county [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=67.84s)]
*  based on how they voted in the House race there. There were concerns about Doge cuts widely aired. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=73.12s)]
*  I did find two women walking on their way out kind of grumbling about the fact that the federal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=79.6s)]
*  government has seen reductions in force before. Why are we acting like this is any different? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=83.68s)]
*  They seemed like they were in the minority on that opinion, though. Do you think Republicans [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=87.92s)]
*  are going to come to find more of those folks who give them credit or more folks like we're hearing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=91.92s)]
*  at these town halls who are just freaked out? I think we're going to see more folks that are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=96.64s)]
*  concerned about this. And I think Republicans need to be careful. I think in particular, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=100.48s)]
*  when it comes to Medicaid cuts, Democrats are clearly going to make this the preexisting [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=104.08s)]
*  conditions conversation as they go forward through the reconciliation process. So I think [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=107.92s)]
*  Republicans need to be cautious. I think Senate Republicans are correct to be saying to Elon [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=112.16s)]
*  Musk and others, you need to have more transparency. You need to slow this down. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=117.44s)]
*  You need to involve us in this process. Congress needs to have a role here. And I think that that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=121.12s)]
*  will continue from Senate Republicans. On the other side of this, though, Alencia, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=125.36s)]
*  I did hear a lot of people last night frustrated by what they see as a lack of activity from [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=129.04s)]
*  Democrats. And I know you and I are going to say the same thing we've talked about at this table [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=134.32s)]
*  before. They're in the minority in Congress. But what would you say to the grassroots who are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=137.76s)]
*  turning out and saying, just do something? Yeah, look, I think Democrats, the base, the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=142.24s)]
*  grassroots, the voters, they want to hear a little bit more from Democrats. It is very [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=146.56s)]
*  interesting where we are right now in our culture, where we see everything on our phones. We get [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=151.52s)]
*  things quickly. And so folks do want to see, feel as though Democrats are doing something. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=155.6s)]
*  But to the point that you are making is that in the minority, there's only but so much that they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=161.12s)]
*  can do in Congress, right? But this is where the messaging game is going to really help Democrats. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=165.6s)]
*  Yes, I think it's imperative that these town halls continue to happen, because now there can be a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=171.44s)]
*  contrast. Democrats are still showing up for their constituents. Republicans started to close [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=175.68s)]
*  their town halls because people were talking about Musk. But also this is where Democrats, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  like in state leadership, governors, like governors of Maryland and Illinois, can also show up and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=185.52s)]
*  talk to voters about the difference with the federal government and the state government and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=191.52s)]
*  how they are standing up to this administration. And so right now it's a messaging and optics game [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=196.4s)]
*  that Democrats need to play in order to shore up the grassroots while Republicans continue to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=200.96s)]
*  cannibalize themselves. I wonder though, too, for Democrats, it's been a long time since there's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=205.28s)]
*  been a decentralization of power outside of one person or outside of people in Washington. Are [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=209.76s)]
*  voters just like not in practice of that, looking to multiple places? Yeah, look, you know, I think [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=214.88s)]
*  when we are back in December, when there was the leadership fight on Capitol Hill around which [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=220.08s)]
*  members of the Democratic Party would lead some of the committees and you saw voters really saying, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=225.6s)]
*  these are the people that we like, the AOCs, the Jasmine Crockett, the Warrens and Sanders and those [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=230.56s)]
*  folks. And then the party still went with some of the older tried and true, right, except for [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=236.0s)]
*  leader Jeffries. Now, the reality is Democrats have to contend with that. How do you speak to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=241.04s)]
*  the base that wants this younger, scrappier kind of ability, leadership ability that penetrates [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  through the way that Donald Trump does, as well as some people with a lot of experience, and not to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=252.32s)]
*  say that those don't have experience, but we're trying to balance and appease both parts of our [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=256.56s)]
*  base. And so it's an interesting thing to see with Democrats trying to get their footing in the midst [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=262.32s)]
*  of so much happening. Appeasement is also the word of the day on the House side of the building as [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=267.68s)]
*  they try to go forward with the Republican reconciliation plan. And Elise, you said, and I [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=271.76s)]
*  don't know if this was Senate shade or not, but you said you were surprised to see the House bill [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=276.0s)]
*  managed to get through. It was a tough road for Speaker Johnson, but they also have to go through [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=279.92s)]
*  the next tough road of reconciling the reconciliation bills. You know this building well. I mean, what is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=284.96s)]
*  this going to look like? Yeah, I think people are forgetting it's great news that the House passed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=289.76s)]
*  their bill. I did not think that they would. Frankly, there was not as much drama around it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=293.76s)]
*  as I thought that there would be. But people need to remember just because the House and the Senate [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=297.44s)]
*  have now passed, have passed their budget resolutions, they have to pass the same budget [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=301.84s)]
*  resolution. So there is so much, there is so much more in this process. They have to hammer out [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=306.0s)]
*  all of these different challenges. You know, even though they haven't gotten to the policy writing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=311.52s)]
*  part, they have to figure out where they're going to go from here. And obviously I think they're [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=316.08s)]
*  going to go with a bigger bill, at least unless they completely stall out. Something to think about [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=320.64s)]
*  is if members of Congress do not have something and we get into late summer and they're having [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=326.8s)]
*  to go back for an August recess period and they have really, I mean, this is the only thing on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=331.68s)]
*  their legislative agenda. That's it. If they don't have anything to tell their constituents that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=336.32s)]
*  they've been doing, I think they're in trouble. So the next couple of months are going to be [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=340.0s)]
*  really critical. They're going to have to defer to shutdown. The next couple of months are going to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=344.32s)]
*  be critical, but then it's also important to remember 14 days from now government shutdown [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=347.36s)]
*  is looming. One Democrat said to me, they feel like they have a mandate from their constituents [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=352.0s)]
*  to shut down the government because Republicans are talking about codifying the cuts that Doge [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=357.28s)]
*  is making within that continuing resolution. Is there a mandate? Is there this difficult moral [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=362.72s)]
*  place for Democrats to be in where they want the government to be functioning, but just not like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=368.8s)]
*  this? I mean, how would you advise them on this? Yeah, you know, it is a hard position to be in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=372.56s)]
*  because Democrats have been talking about the harm, the irreparable harm that we will see if some of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  these cuts go through. And yet at the same time, in order for a lot of voters to fully understand [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=382.24s)]
*  what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing, people are unfortunately going to have to feel some of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=388.0s)]
*  that. And the only way that that happens is if the shutdown happens or if this bill is passed with [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=394.08s)]
*  these Medicaid cuts. And so Democrats are in a peculiar position. The key piece is to be able to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=398.96s)]
*  message this well, correctly, because Donald Trump can spin a narrative very quickly and his base [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=404.88s)]
*  starts to believe it. But there is an opportunity now with so many of Republican voters upset with [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=410.32s)]
*  some of these cuts that impact their daily lives, that if Democrats get the messaging right, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=416.16s)]
*  whether or not the government shuts down, they could win on that. And that could be helpful to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=420.8s)]
*  galvanize voters on both sides of the aisle to start showing up and pushing back. The storytelling [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  piece, I think, is going to be important. I do want to take a brief pause away from domestic [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=429.68s)]
*  politics to the world stage, because the way that President Trump has been talking about President [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=433.92s)]
*  Zelensky, calling him a dictator, then apparently saying, oh, did I say that? That's terrible. He [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=438.24s)]
*  said it. But Republicans, it's a serious about face for the way that we've talked about an ally [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=442.56s)]
*  that we've supported through aid and messaging. Republicans on Capitol Hill feeling like they're [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=447.76s)]
*  in a 180, but not forcefully rebuking this, at least not saying Trump shouldn't talk like this. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I think Republicans are much more worried about what Trump is doing versus what he's saying. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  I think having Zelensky here today going forward with the critical minerals deal between the United [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=466.32s)]
*  States and the Ukraine and having just so much change over the last few weeks, I think Republicans [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=470.8s)]
*  are going to give him a little bit of a longer leash because he is delivering some of these [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=479.76s)]
*  in the Ukrainian and Russian conflict. I think we haven't seen this, certainly under Biden's [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=486.48s)]
*  administration. So I think they're going to be willing to give him a little bit more leeway [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=492.32s)]
*  see how this plays out. You did see a lot of Republicans who were making it clear that they [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  did not feel that Ukraine was involved and that it was a clearly Russian aggression, but that's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  about as far as they would go. So I think they're much more watching what he's doing versus what he's [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  saying. I think that's a fair point, although the muddying of language is certainly stunning and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  shocking, making our allies very nervous on the world stage. Two absolute pros here, Alencia Johnson, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=515.36s)]
*  who is the author of a book coming out in about a week and a half called Flip the Tables, cannot [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=521.12s)]
*  wait to read. Congrats, my friend. Annalise Keller, also thank you so much for joining us. Both of you are amazing. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaLuIcpo8M&t=525.2s)]
