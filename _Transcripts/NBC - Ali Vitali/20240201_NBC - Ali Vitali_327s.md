# New Biden ad on Truth Social hits 'confused' Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE)
*  The Biden re-election campaign seems to be sharpening its attacks against Donald Trump's mental capabilities, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=0.0s)]
*  and they called him out on his own turf yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=6.24s)]
*  The Biden HQ account posted a video to Truth Social, the former president's fledgling site there, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=9.44s)]
*  in which they tagged Trump and— [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Have you seen this new ad? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=18.68s)]
*  Donald Trump is truly confused. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=21.72s)]
*  Nikki Haley is in charge of security. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=23.96s)]
*  We offered her 10,000 people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=26.52s)]
*  They don't want to talk about that. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=28.52s)]
*  He didn't just get me confused. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=29.96s)]
*  He mentioned it over and over and over again. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  He's not what he was in 2016. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=35.0s)]
*  He has declined. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=37.440000000000005s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=38.72s)]
*  I mean, we won last time. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=39.72s)]
*  We won 50 states, right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=41.0s)]
*  This is not Donald Trump of 2016, guys. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=42.56s)]
*  What? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=44.56s)]
*  What is— [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  If he is off the teleprompter, he can barely keep a cogent thought. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=46.44s)]
*  I mean, that's just fact. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=49.8s)]
*  We are an institute in a powerful death penalty. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=51.0s)]
*  We will put this on. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=54.88s)]
*  I think he's declining. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=56.08s)]
*  I stumbled and mumbled purposely. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  I do speak in long, complex sentences [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=59.08s)]
*  and have a lot of material in each sentence. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=61.32s)]
*  You have voter ID to buy a loaf of bread. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=63.72s)]
*  You have ID to buy a loaf of bread. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=65.64s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=68.44s)]
*  He's a little confused these days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=70.16s)]
*  A person close to Trump actually says that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  he's rattled by Biden's efforts to get under his skin. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=74.48s)]
*  A little dark Brandon there at the end. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=79.88s)]
*  For more on the 2024 campaign trail, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=81.24s)]
*  let's bring in politics editor for Bloomberg, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=83.4s)]
*  Laura Davidson. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=85.64s)]
*  So, Laura, I mean, this is the Biden team's efforts to turn what they, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=86.56s)]
*  you know, many people thought was a vulnerability, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=91.0s)]
*  the president's own age into perhaps a strength, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=93.08s)]
*  highlighting that Donald Trump is, shall we say, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=95.16s)]
*  prone to misstatement of late. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=98.28s)]
*  But it's more than just that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=100.28s)]
*  It does seem like it's a piece of a larger strategy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  to really, over the last few weeks, ramp up the attacks on Trump, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  try to get under his skin and really draw the contrast [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  between the two men who likely are facing off in November. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=110.24s)]
*  Yeah, and this is one of the advantages, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=112.96s)]
*  if you're the Biden campaign, of Trump having to run [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=114.36s)]
*  in a primary race, they're able to use Nikki Haley's words, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=116.48s)]
*  saying, look, it's not just Democrats that say that Trump is on decline. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=119.28s)]
*  It's members of his own party. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, and he had a very public gaffe in New Hampshire [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=124.12s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago where he mixed up Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=126.44s)]
*  which sort of really illustrated the point of that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=129.72s)]
*  that Democrats have been trying to make. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=132.4s)]
*  And it also helps distract from the attacks that Trump has been making [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=134.08s)]
*  and blunt those attacks on Biden's age. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=137.52s)]
*  So it's kind of saying, look, you know, both men are old, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=139.68s)]
*  would be, you know, a historically old president. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=142.72s)]
*  So let's move on and fight on a different issue. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=145.16s)]
*  Yeah, I know you make a great point there about the importance [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=147.16s)]
*  of a Republican voice making these attacks to Republican audiences. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=149.08s)]
*  Perhaps a Fox News viewer who would never listen to Joe Biden say the same thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=152.72s)]
*  But you mentioned we're talking about Haley. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  Some FEC reports are out, some fundraising deadlines and results are out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=159.24s)]
*  And Herrera Super PAC entered 2024 with just three and a half million dollars on hand. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=162.44s)]
*  Her campaign has said they've been doing well in recent weeks, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=166.6s)]
*  but there is campaigns usually end when they run out of money. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=169.08s)]
*  What's the fear here that Haley and her supporters may soon do just that? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=172.6s)]
*  So Haley, for her money isn't the problem. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=176.08s)]
*  It's voter support right now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=178.76s)]
*  She has the backing of major Republican billionaires, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=179.88s)]
*  Ken Griffin, Paul Singer, and she's been raising a lot of money. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=183.44s)]
*  She's been spending a lot of money. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=186.56s)]
*  So we saw her end the year with not a lot, but she's been in New York yesterday [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=187.56s)]
*  and South Florida, also doing a bunch of fundraisers with, you know, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=191.56s)]
*  the biggest names on Wall Street. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=194.4s)]
*  Koch brothers are continuing to also fund her as well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=196.8s)]
*  So the issue is not necessarily will she have money, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=199.16s)]
*  but will she be able to be able to, you know, make the case to voters of, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=202.16s)]
*  look, I have a chance to become the nominee. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=205.92s)]
*  That path is becoming very, very narrow. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=208.56s)]
*  And, you know, you see donors already saying, you know, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=211.16s)]
*  looks like Trump is going to be the nominee. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=213.32s)]
*  Maybe I go ahead and throw a couple million bucks his way. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=215.28s)]
*  The Biden team was pleased with their fundraising hall last night. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=217.72s)]
*  So we just heard Congresswoman Dingell talk about Michigan, her home state, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=220.92s)]
*  and really offering a pretty blunt warning to the Biden team saying, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=225.4s)]
*  this is going to be really close. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=229.16s)]
*  Don't expect that you can't just count on Michigan going blue. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=230.56s)]
*  And Bloomberg, I know, had a series of swing state polls released yesterday [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=233.72s)]
*  which showed Donald Trump up in all of them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=238.0s)]
*  Now, some of the margins are pretty small. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=240.12s)]
*  And we should, of course, note it's only February 1st. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=242.44s)]
*  There's a lot to happen between now and November. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=244.44s)]
*  But there's a snapshot of where the race is right now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=246.52s)]
*  And it shows a really tight one and maybe even slightly edge Trump in these places. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  Walk us through some of it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So in every of the seven swing states that we looked at, Trump is ahead. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  And if you look at the trend, we've been doing this for several months now, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=258.32s)]
*  things keep going in Trump's favor. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  So that is a big warning sign to the Biden campaign that in the places that are going to decide the race, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  that Biden is not particularly popular. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  There is, however, one bright side for the Biden campaign is that is Trump's legal risks. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=270.11999999999995s)]
*  This poll did show that more than half of voters, about 53 percent, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=274.32s)]
*  would not vote for Trump if he were convicted of a crime. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=277.76s)]
*  You know, that's a whole different question of will any of the cases that he's facing [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=280.28s)]
*  get to a conviction before Election Day? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  But that's one thing that the Trump campaign certainly is watching closely on. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=285.96s)]
*  You know, how does this how does his legal status affect what voters and swing states think? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  And we're certainly waiting for the federal appeals court here in Washington to issue a ruling [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=293.08s)]
*  on presidential immunity, which could start shaping some of those questions that could come any day now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=296.28s)]
*  Polls are close. Really interesting. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=300.28s)]
*  We thank you for bringing him to this politics editor from Bloomberg, Laura Davidson. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=301.64s)]
*  Good to see you. Thanks for being here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7RYDfzCaE&t=305.24s)]
