# Michigan protest vote reflects 'frustration' and 'disappointment' over Biden's Gaza stance
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0)
*  President Biden is expected to easily win today's primary, but Michigan governor and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden campaign co-chair Gretchen Whitmer acknowledged that a large portion of the electorate [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  will not vote for Biden to protest his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=10.56s)]
*  I think there will be a sizable number of votes for uncommitted. I think that it is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=17.12s)]
*  every person's right to make their statement about what's important to the parties. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=22.88s)]
*  The uncommitted organizers have said that they want to get at least 10,000 votes. Do you think [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=26.88s)]
*  they'll reach that? I think that that's possible, yeah. President Biden has seen significant [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=31.28s)]
*  backlash in the state from its Arab-American and Muslim-American population as well as some [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=37.76s)]
*  young progressive voters. We should note Governor Whitmer will join us later this morning on Morning [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=42.48s)]
*  Joe. Joining us now, White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Sabrina Siddiqui. Sabrina, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=48.16s)]
*  good to see you again this morning. So the president faced a little bit of a protest vote [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=53.76s)]
*  in New Hampshire, viewers will recall. Some people there were encouraged to write in ceasefire [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  instead of the president's name, and that amounted to next to nothing. Today feels much more sizable, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  and I know you've been focusing on it for quite some time. So give us the lay of the land. What [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=67.6s)]
*  should we and President Biden expect in Michigan today? Thanks for having me. Well, I think first [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=71.6s)]
*  and foremost, President Biden will comfortably win the Michigan primary. There's no question [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=78.0s)]
*  about that since he's facing minimal opposition. But as you point out, there is this effort to get [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=83.12s)]
*  voters to cast their ballots as uncommitted. And Michigan is the state with the highest number [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=88.64s)]
*  and percentage of Arab-Americans in the country. And those who have been frustrated by President [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=96.64s)]
*  Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, and specifically the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=103.44s)]
*  are using this as an opportunity to really warn the president that he does not currently have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=108.8s)]
*  their vote. And barring a significant change in policy, they are likely to either vote third party [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  or stay at home in November. It's not that they're planning to vote for former President Trump, but [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=120.64s)]
*  you know, I think that the margin that this group is looking toward is having at least 10,000 [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=125.84s)]
*  uncommitted votes. That was Trump's margin of victory in 2016. Now Biden, President Biden won [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=134.16s)]
*  by roughly 154,000 votes in 2020. But I think the message is still that if this is a close election, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=139.12s)]
*  then that margin of victory or that margin of 10,000 could actually make a difference. If not, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=146.56s)]
*  you know, they could potentially also secure more uncommitted votes. And really what it is, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  is again, a warning sign to President Biden in the White House that they need to change course in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=155.76s)]
*  their handling of the war and do a lot more to try and reassure this community and get more, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=160.4s)]
*  reaffirm their support with a community that in past elections has predominantly voted for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=168.4s)]
*  Democrats. Yeah, it could be a real warning to Biden and also potentially a humbling moment [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=172.72s)]
*  for the president if those numbers are sizable. So Sabrina, let's take the other side of this then. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=176.88s)]
*  So what does the president and his campaign staff, how are they going to address this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=181.44s)]
*  in the aftermath of this morning's election, today's election? How will they reach out to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=186.56s)]
*  the community and how do they hope to repair things by November? Well, it's been a bit of a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=191.04s)]
*  problem because last month, the Biden campaign dispatched its campaign manager to meet with some [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=196.96s)]
*  local Arab American leaders. And Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden campaign manager, was [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=203.44s)]
*  rebuffed by many local elected officials. So in recent weeks, you actually saw some top [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=208.8s)]
*  foreign policy and national security officials from the Biden administration sit down and have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=213.36s)]
*  a conversation. Now, the biggest problem is that these voters are not looking for a shift in tone. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  They're looking for a shift in policy. So what I often have heard from them is they don't want to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=225.28s)]
*  talk about the politics. They don't want to talk about how they're going to vote in November so [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=229.52s)]
*  much as what is the president going to do to bring about what they want, which is a permanent [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=234.88000000000002s)]
*  ceasefire in this war, as well as the U.S. no longer sending military aid to Israel, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=241.52s)]
*  at least in the course of this conflict. And that's something that this administration is not really [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=248.88s)]
*  prepared to do. I mean, the president is pushing for a temporary ceasefire. And he said last night [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  that he hopes that he hopes there will be one by Monday. But we're not expecting a significant [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=259.2s)]
*  shift in the U.S. support for Israel in this war. And so what the lasting impact of that is going [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=264.64s)]
*  to be with this community is still untold. Again, I think the Biden campaign is trying to draw [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=272.64s)]
*  contrast with former President Trump, a lot of his inflammatory rhetoric and policies toward [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=277.28s)]
*  Muslim and Arab Americans. But it's just not clear that drawing that contrast is going to be enough [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=282.64s)]
*  when these voters are, I think, really frustrated by and disappointed with President Biden's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=287.68s)]
*  posture, especially as the death toll in Gaza has neared 30,000 people, most of whom are civilians. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=294.56s)]
*  Yeah, you make a great point here. As we'll get into a little later in the show, the president has [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=300.32s)]
*  hopes of a ceasefire coming. And certainly those around his reelection bid hope that the war in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=303.92s)]
*  Gaza will fade from the headlines by November. But will this population in Michigan and other [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=308.64s)]
*  places sort of forgive and move on and come back to the president? That's the open question. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=312.88s)]
*  Terrific stuff to start us off this morning. White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=317.04s)]
*  Sabrina Siddiqui. Sabrina, thank you. We'll talk to you again soon. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=320.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdBZqj2fuP0&t=324.56s)]
