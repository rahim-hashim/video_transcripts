# Energy Dept. determines with 'low confidence' Covid may have originated from Chinese lab leak
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig)
*  national security correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, Michael Gordon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=0.0s)]
*  Michael, it's your reporting this weekend that we're all talking about today, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  the Energy Department's determination that COVID-19 indeed may have come from a [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=7.2s)]
*  lab leak in Wuhan, China. Tell us a little bit about how the Energy [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=11.44s)]
*  Department came to that conclusion, but also who agrees or disagrees within the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  rest of the federal government. So, Jonathan, this is a story I did with my [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=20.88s)]
*  colleague Warren Strobel at the Wall Street Journal, and we've been digging [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=25.96s)]
*  into this for a while. What happened was in 2021, the intelligence community [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=29.7s)]
*  submitted a report that was unclassified version in October that laid bare the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=36.82s)]
*  divisions within the intelligence community as to whether this arose [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=42.94s)]
*  naturally, meaning a virus left from an animal to human, or whether it might have [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=46.42s)]
*  been an inadvertent accidental lab leak. At that time, the Department of Energy [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=51.42s)]
*  was agnostic. It hadn't taken a side one way or the other. What shifted is it's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=57.1s)]
*  now leaning toward the lab theory. It said it's most likely, but it's taking [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=62.74s)]
*  this judgment with what it calls low confidence. So there's been a shift in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=67.98s)]
*  the Energy Department position, and it's significant because the FBI has already [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=73.08s)]
*  assessed with moderate confidence that that's the result of a lab leak. So you [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=78.18s)]
*  have the Energy Department, which has national laboratories under its [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  jurisdiction, the FBI on one side, and then four elements and the National [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=86.14s)]
*  Intelligence Council on the other side, albeit with low confidence as well. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=90.98s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about quickly, if you will, what that means, any of low [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=96.02s)]
*  confidence. I think for some watching this or reading your story, maybe like [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=99.82s)]
*  confused, like, well, why didn't they wait? If they're saying they're not very [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=105.1s)]
*  confident, but that's not actually what this means. Just explain that the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=107.7s)]
*  government speak here for us, will you, if you please. Well, what's important [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=111.14s)]
*  about the Energy Department is they control these national labs. Low [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=115.1s)]
*  confidence means they're not sure. It's not been established. They haven't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  identified a particular incident in a laboratory that's led to a specific [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  outbreak in Wuhan, but they've been looking at Lawrence Livermore in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=128.22s)]
*  particular has been looking at Chinese academic papers. They're familiar with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=133.06s)]
*  the kind of research that was going on in the institutions in Wuhan, which was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=137.7s)]
*  into coronavirus. They're has it in judgment. So it means precisely what it [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=141.7s)]
*  says. They're not sure that this is what it is, but they're leaning much more in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=147.7s)]
*  favor of what was once considered to be a fringe theory. The lab theory. It's no [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=153.66s)]
*  longer a fringe theory. It's now considered to be a mainstream theory, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=158.1s)]
*  although as yet unproven. So it's certainly this will only grow murkier [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  here in the aftermath of this report. So Michael, just tell us a little bit about [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=167.3s)]
*  what the next steps might be. Other investigations being launched by the U. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=172.02s)]
*  S government. And could there be any sort of disciplinary action taken against [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=175.34s)]
*  China if a more definitive conclusion is reached? I doubt the latter. But what's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=179.18s)]
*  really going to happen over the next few months is the Congress is getting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=185.18s)]
*  involved in this. And you know, the the unclassified product, the intelligence [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  shared with the American public is really bare bones. It's 17 pages. The FBI, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=193.82s)]
*  which is determined it was a lag with moderate confidence, whether it's right or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=198.82s)]
*  wrong, has not spoken directly to the public. It hasn't testified to Congress. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  It hasn't laid bare its analysis. Lawrence Livermore, which has done some [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  work on this, hasn't spoken directly to the Congress in public form or to the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  American people. And I think the Congress is going to dig into this more. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=217.74s)]
*  And I think some more of the analysis on both sides is going to be laid bare. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=223.06s)]
*  And I think this is important because this is a virus that killed more than a [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=227.86s)]
*  million Americans over a period of three years and more than six million people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=231.5s)]
*  worldwide. And it's not something that I think it's be good just to say, well, we [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  don't know. We can't learn any more about it. I think they can learn more about it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=241.66000000000003s)]
*  And I think the shift in the energy department's position is an indication [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=245.06s)]
*  that they are learning more about it. And this report comes out, of course, at a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=250.22s)]
*  moment of increased tension between Washington and Beijing. National Security [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  correspondent for The Wall Street Journal Michael Gordon. Thank you so much for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=258.74s)]
*  joining us this morning. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPkfdVsT_Ig&t=261.42s)]
