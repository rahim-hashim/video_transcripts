# 58 percent of New Hampshire GOP voters back Trump for primary
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM)
*  New polling from one of those key battleground states shows the former President Trump still has a tight grip on the Republican Party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=0.0s)]
*  In the latest Emerson College survey, 58% of GOP voters in the great state of New Hampshire say that Trump is their preferred candidate for the 2024 Republican primary. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=7.0s)]
*  That is a 41-point lead over the second-place finisher, Governor DeSantis. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=18.0s)]
*  And third, with just 7%, is New Hampshire's own Governor Chris Sununu. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=24.0s)]
*  But in a hypothetical general election matchup, Sununu is the only Republican candidate who could beat President Joe Biden, according to this poll. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=28.0s)]
*  Sununu said earlier this year that he was considering a run for president but has not officially jumped into the race. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=38.0s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=44.0s)]
*  Julia, good morning. So let's talk about the state of the Republican field. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=49.0s)]
*  And we'll do, let's start with Governor Sununu, actually, with some of, he's one of, representative perhaps, of some of the lesser-known Republicans considering jumping in the race. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=55.0s)]
*  Talk to us, though, about the uphill climb that someone like he faces, considering the poll we just showed, where Governor DeSantis, who is not a lesser name, who is widely considered the most formidable challenger to Trump, is getting crushed in that poll and many others we're seeing across the nation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=65.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Jonathan, it's really interesting because I think a lot of this polling sort of mirrors the problem that Republicans had in 2022, where in primaries a lot of these more, I don't want to say moderate Republicans, but maybe more mainstream, more establishment Republicans, like a Governor Sununu, for example, don't do as well in primaries, but they seem to be doing better in general elections. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=83.0s)]
*  And that's going to be an issue for Republicans up and down the ballot this coming election. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=107.0s)]
*  So, we're going to have to find a way to really explain to Republican primary voters that they need to keep that general election strategy in mind going forward. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=112.0s)]
*  But, you know, look, I don't think it's necessarily surprising that Governor Sununu is not polling as well as maybe, say, Ron DeSantis or Donald Trump in a Republican primary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=120.0s)]
*  Yes, he is the governor of that state. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=130.0s)]
*  However, we do know that Donald Trump is simply the more well-known name and we know that with presidential politics, Ron DeSantis' name has been more synonymous with 2024 talk than Chris Sununu. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=132.0s)]
*  We know that Chris Sununu is still considering it hasn't had the same national presence that Ron DeSantis had. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=144.0s)]
*  So, I think those numbers are fascinating, but a real issue for Republicans going into a general election. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=150.0s)]
*  It shows that there might be a path for a mainstream Republican in 2024 in general, but it sure seems like it would be difficult to get there through the GOP primary, which is only moving more to the right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=156.0s)]
*  Julia, you've got some new reporting today on another GOP governor who might jump into the 2024 mix. Tell us about that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=167.0s)]
*  Yes, so Governor Glenn Youngkin from Virginia is really also like Governor DeSantis, sort of traveling the country and being more of a national presence. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=173.0s)]
*  He's not going as much to these early primary states as Governor DeSantis is. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=183.0s)]
*  However, he's not rolling a potential presidential bid out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=187.0s)]
*  You know, he was on CNBC's Squawk Box, for example, last week. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=191.0s)]
*  He's going on another network for a town hall tomorrow to do town hall on education, his major issue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=195.0s)]
*  So he is very much trying to become a national presence in the media while meeting with donors in states like New York. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=201.0s)]
*  Governor Youngkin is seen as someone who really wrote the playbook for Republicans going into 2021. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=209.0s)]
*  He sort of defied expectations in one election in a blue leaning purple state like Virginia. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=215.0s)]
*  So I think a lot of Republicans like, you know, Chris Sununu say someone like Governor Glenn Youngkin could do very well in a general election, despite the fact that he is very conservative. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=223.0s)]
*  At the same time, though, he doesn't seem to be registering as much with Republican primary voters. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=235.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, Jonathan, because he has a lot of the same views that Donald Trump and Governor DeSantis have and him and Governor DeSantis policy wise are actually very similar. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=241.0s)]
*  But stylistically, they couldn't be more different. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=250.0s)]
*  They have very different personalities. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=253.0s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is much more in your face, much more brash. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=255.0s)]
*  Governor Youngkin is definitely more of a calmer presence, someone who is probably more diplomatic in how he speaks to Democrats, the media, voters and such. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=258.0s)]
*  So, you know, going forward, it will be interesting to see how that style plays out in the Republican primary. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=270.0s)]
*  But like I said, polls show that this is still a Trump DeSantis race. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=275.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's been sort of takeaway this week. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=279.0s)]
*  Maybe it's a Trump DeSantis race, but Trump is heavily favored and more candidates that jump in. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=281.0s)]
*  Probably the better it is for Trump, too, because we know his base is going to stay with him. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=286.0s)]
*  The Hills, Julia Manchester, thank you for your reporting this morning. We really appreciate it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjL9rEQetnM&t=289.0s)]
