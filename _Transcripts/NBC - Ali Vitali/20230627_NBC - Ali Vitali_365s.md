# Proposed Ohio law raises threshold for constitutional amendments
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc)
*  In a special election this August, voters in the state of Ohio will decide on a new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=0.0s)]
*  law that, if approved, would change the way amendments are added to that state's constitution. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=5.28s)]
*  What's being called issue one would require approval from 60 percent of voters to pass [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=11.92s)]
*  a new constitutional amendment instead of a simple majority. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=17.88s)]
*  Proponents of the changes say this move would protect Ohioans from special interests, while [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=22.52s)]
*  opponents say it would make it harder for everyday citizens to be heard. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=27.96s)]
*  Joining us now is former Ohio Democratic Party chairman and author of the new book Saving [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=31.96s)]
*  Democracy, David Pepper. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=37.72s)]
*  David, good morning. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=39.56s)]
*  So put this into context for us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=40.56s)]
*  How does this proposal to Ohio symbolize what's happening across the country and with states [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  and state houses that many perceive are, frankly, under attack? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=49.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I argue in both my books that the far right is using state houses as the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=54.92s)]
*  place to attack democracy most fiercely. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  No one's paying attention largely. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=64.08s)]
*  They have powers like gerrymandering, voter suppression, and this is yet another sort [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=66.08s)]
*  of stage of that attack. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=70.08s)]
*  So the context here is that Ohioans have had for more than a century the right to amend [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=71.76s)]
*  our constitution with 50 percent of the vote. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=76.48s)]
*  Like Kansas, a few months ago, citizens in Ohio began gathering signatures to amend [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=79.72s)]
*  our constitution to protect abortion access in Ohio's constitution. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=84.8s)]
*  And that was what triggered this really cynical effort to change the rules of the game of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=89.08s)]
*  amending the constitution while citizens were gathering signatures for this pro-choice amendment. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=94.0s)]
*  It's even more complicated than that, though, because this is a legislature that had recently [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=101.0s)]
*  banned having August special elections, but because they see this November election coming [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=105.6s)]
*  for abortion access, they had to get in front of it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  So they violated their own law banning special elections in August to put on the ballot [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  something to raise the threshold to 60 percent, thinking that would kill something that clearly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=119.32s)]
*  has to support 50 percent of Ohioans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=124.38s)]
*  It's a perfect example of how these state houses are being jerry-rigged to subvert the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=128.04s)]
*  majority will in states like Ohio. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  We know that abortion access is popular across the country. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=135.42s)]
*  The Dobbs decision said it should go back to the people to decide. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  And all across the country, that's the opposite of what's happening in these jerry-mandered [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=141.38s)]
*  extreme estate houses. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=145.5s)]
*  This is just the latest of that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=147.0s)]
*  So, David, you've been beating that drum for a while. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  The Democrats need to get better at these local races, need to start winning these state [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  legislatures in order to prevent things like exactly this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, we are now less than a year and a half from the next election. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=160.17999999999998s)]
*  Do you think that the Democrats are doing enough, as you survey the nation, are they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=163.44s)]
*  doing enough to win those local races, of which you say are so important? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=172.44s)]
*  We actually had a really good year last November when Democrats, against the sort of midterm [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=173.84s)]
*  usual pattern, picked up the Michigan state house, the Pennsylvania state house, the Minnesota [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=179.0s)]
*  Senate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=184.24s)]
*  But we have to do this across the country. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=185.42s)]
*  It's not only that we have to win, we have to run. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=187.04s)]
*  And 50% of the Tennessee Republicans who voted out the two Justins did not even have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=190.08s)]
*  an opponent last November. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=195.02s)]
*  That's happening all across the country. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  We have a crisis of unopposed extremists, and then we wonder why the extremism gets [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=198.8s)]
*  worse in all these states, including in states that Obama won, like Iowa and Indiana, or [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=204.36s)]
*  that Clinton won in Missouri. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=209.12s)]
*  So my advice in this book is start recruiting now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=211.12s)]
*  Everyone should look around where they are, especially if they haven't had an opponent [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  for an extremist in years. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=219.4s)]
*  Know when the recruiting deadline is and get people on this ballot for not just this year [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=221.08s)]
*  with Virginia and a few other states, but next year so that when the top of their ticket [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=226.36s)]
*  is probably Donald Trump, an extremist who's already struggling the polls, make sure we [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=232.06s)]
*  have an opponent for every extremist, for Congress, down through these state houses [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=237.8s)]
*  where so much of the attack is taking place. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=242.62s)]
*  When we don't run, there's no accountability. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  There's no transparency. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=247.86s)]
*  And these state houses behave in the lawless ways that Ohio's is behaving as we speak. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=249.58s)]
*  And David, very briefly as a last one, Ohio for so many election cycles was the definitive [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=254.62s)]
*  swing state, the ultimate bellwether state. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=259.42s)]
*  It has definitely trended Republican last couple cycles. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=261.82s)]
*  Where do you think things stand as we head to 24? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=264.02000000000004s)]
*  You know, I actually think the big race here is obviously going to be Sherrod Brown. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=268.1s)]
*  And if you look closely, Tim Ryan only lost by six, even though the governor in Ohio, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  Republican, won by 26. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=277.02s)]
*  So that really Trumpy brand here, JD Vance, did not do nearly as well as the more moderate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  Republican brand did. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=286.14s)]
*  And I think Sherrod is going to end up facing a similar sort of far right Trumpy type of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=287.94s)]
*  candidate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=293.1s)]
*  So I think he's got a good path to victory. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=294.1s)]
*  It's going to be his closest race probably ever. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=295.1s)]
*  But I think he's got a good path. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=297.54s)]
*  I mean, we'll see if Biden chooses to contest here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=298.65999999999997s)]
*  But I think Sherrod Brown, we also have a big set of Supreme Court races. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=301.46s)]
*  They also performed, the Democrats did last November. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=305.94s)]
*  So I wouldn't write Ohio off. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=308.52s)]
*  It's clearly tougher than it was. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=310.48s)]
*  But you know what we are now? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=312.48s)]
*  We are a bellwether of what happens when an extremist gerrymandered statehouse hijacks [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=313.8s)]
*  your state. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=318.36s)]
*  It starts legislating in all sorts of ways way beyond where the state voters actually [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=319.36s)]
*  are. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=325.36s)]
*  For example, we're the state that had that abortion ban, no exceptions, that led to that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=326.36s)]
*  Ohio rape victim having to go to Indiana. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=331.48s)]
*  That is so far out of whack with where Ohio voters are. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=334.16s)]
*  But that's what happens when you have extremists take over these gerrymandered legislatures. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=337.24s)]
*  David Pepper, we appreciate you joining us this morning. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZgRiqnuYHc&t=341.76s)]
