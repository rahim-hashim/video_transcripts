# President Biden arrives in Israel
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo)
*  Thanks for being with us as we are following breaking news this morning. Less than two weeks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=0.0s)]
*  after Hamas terror attacks since Israel plunging into a new war, President Joe Biden is now in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=5.28s)]
*  that country to show solidarity with our Middle Eastern ally. The president touched down in [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=12.08s)]
*  Tel Aviv about an hour ago where he was greeted on the tarmac by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=17.12s)]
*  The two men, as you will see, shared an embrace. The two are set to hold talks throughout the day [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=23.28s)]
*  as tensions in the war start to spill outside Israel and Gaza. Last night, pro-Palestinian [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=29.44s)]
*  protesters clashed with police in parts of the West Bank, Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan, all in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=36.64s)]
*  response to a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza. The Palestinian health ministry says that more [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  than 200 people were killed there, but Israeli and Gaza officials are both blaming the other side [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=50.72s)]
*  for the deadly violence. That blast has already forced changes to the president's schedule. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  Just as Biden was departing for Israel yesterday, the King of Jordan cancelled a planned summit [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  between himself, Biden, the Palestinian leader, and the president of Egypt. In a statement, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=69.92s)]
*  Jordan's foreign minister wrote, quote, a summit would not be able to stop the war now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=76.08s)]
*  Now, that explosion at a Gaza hospital has killed hundreds of people under investigation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=82.8s)]
*  as we speak. It happened in Gaza City in the northern part of the territory that was placed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=88.64s)]
*  under an evacuation order by Israel last week. Hamas, which launched terrorist attacks that set [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=93.84s)]
*  off this war, immediately blamed Israel for the explosion. Israel, for its part, says the explosion [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=101.84s)]
*  was caused by a misfired rocket launched by another terrorist group, one known as Islamic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=108.88s)]
*  Jihad. Prior to arriving in Israel, President Joe Biden released a statement that read that he was, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=116.08s)]
*  quote, outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion, adding that he immediately spoke to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=122.8s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu and the King of Jordan and directed his national security team to continue [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=129.04s)]
*  gathering evidence about what exactly happened. Meanwhile, Israel's defense forces overnight [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=136.16s)]
*  shared video on social media claiming that it was proof that the explosion was caused by a failed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=143.28s)]
*  rocket launched by that Islamic Jihad group. And just a few moments ago, as President Biden sat down [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=149.92s)]
*  with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the beginning of their bilateral meeting there in Israel, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=156.24s)]
*  the president was heard to say this by the press pool, quote, based on what I've seen, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=160.0s)]
*  it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you, he told Netanyahu, suggesting that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=165.52s)]
*  indeed it was not an Israeli rocket, but rather one that came from inside Gaza. The president added, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  quote, but there's a lot of people out there not sure. The president did not take any questions [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=178.08s)]
*  from the reporters as they were being moved out of that room. Joining us live now from Tel Aviv is [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=183.84s)]
*  senior national correspondent for NBC News, Jay Gray, and in Washington, White House reporter [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=190.8s)]
*  for the Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas. Jay, let's start with you. As the president begins [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=196.64s)]
*  his visit today, he's only on the ground for a few hours, touched down a short time ago. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=202.48s)]
*  You're following the aftermath of that explosion, that certainly though the president suggesting [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=207.68s)]
*  that U.S. intelligence believes that it came from Gaza, it has already inflamed much of the Arab world, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=213.84s)]
*  give us the latest on the ground there. Yeah, and I think you make a great point there, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=220.48s)]
*  Jonathan. It's the images driving this right now, the image of the president arriving in the war [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=225.84s)]
*  zone here, hugging on the tarmac with the leaders of Israel and several of them who greeted him there, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=230.32s)]
*  the images of an area that has been air attacked for days by Israeli forces, now with an explosion [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=238.32s)]
*  at a hospital. That is pushing both sides in this right now and it's not in a good direction, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  obviously. We know that hundreds are dead, as you summed up expertly, Hamas blaming Israel during [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=250.8s)]
*  an airstrike, and there were dozens yesterday. Israel saying it was that failed rocket launched [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=258.24s)]
*  by the Islamic Jihad. Look, the biggest concern, and one of the main reasons that the president [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  made this trip, was to try and keep violence from spreading into a wider military conflict here. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=269.2s)]
*  That's going to be a much more difficult task now, especially since that summit with all of [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=275.52s)]
*  his Arab counterparts has been canceled due to a period of mourning. So that's not going to happen. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  They are meeting right now, the president and Israel, and discussing what comes next. But [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=288.24s)]
*  remember the other side of this trip as well, Jonathan. He was here to try and facilitate some [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  humanitarian aid, getting into Gaza and helping those who were caught in the middle of all of this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=300.56s)]
*  And it's not clear where that stands right now. Again, that was one of the primary tenants of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=305.44s)]
*  president coming here and getting some of the food, water, medicine that is stacked up on the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=311.28s)]
*  Rafa border crossing with Egypt into the country. It's just not happening right now. And Ken, you [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=316.8s)]
*  wrote about this tightrope that President Biden has to walk when it comes to supporting Israel, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=322.24s)]
*  but also noting humanitarian concerns, trying to prevent this war from escalating. His job just got [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=327.92s)]
*  that much harder because of this hospital explosion, no matter who's at fault, because the narrative [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=335.12s)]
*  is such, the images of such, have already angered so much of the region. Yeah, and it's going to be [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  harder for the president to appear as an honest broker. I think the fact that the meeting in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=347.04s)]
*  Jordan is not happening makes it much more of a challenge for him to appear on one hand standing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=352.24s)]
*  shoulder to shoulder with America's ally in Israel, but also then meeting with Arab leaders to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=358.64s)]
*  talk to them about ways that we can get humanitarian aid into Gaza and open that border [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=366.0s)]
*  crossing. I think also just the larger question is, how do you contain this war and how do you [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=372.56s)]
*  send a message to Iran and to Hezbollah that they cannot open a northern front in this war? I think [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  all of those things are complicated by this explosion and what the perception is going to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=387.28s)]
*  be. Is the U.S. going to look like it's putting its thumb on the scale or giving Israel a green light [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=392.55999999999995s)]
*  to go into Gaza? And perhaps you would then have mass civilian casualties. I think that's the tightrope [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  that the president is walking right now. Yeah, an extraordinarily fraught moment, a tricky job for [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=408.32s)]
*  the president made that much more so by this, that Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah has now [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=413.6s)]
*  called for a day of unprecedented anger after that explosion at the Gaza City hospital. Hezbollah's [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=419.20000000000005s)]
*  statement follows days of rising tensions between the group and Israel since the war began. Fights [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=426.24s)]
*  have broken out along the Lebanese-Israeli border that have left soldiers and operatives dead on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  both sides. It's reported in Axios this morning that as a result of that fighting, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=438.0s)]
*  the White House has been discussing the possibility of using military force if Hezbollah attacks Israel [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=442.88s)]
*  in a more significant way. That's according to three U.S. officials and one Israeli official who [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=449.52s)]
*  have knowledge of the situation. The Biden administration has sent messages to Hezbollah [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=454.8s)]
*  through third parties and made it clear, warning Hezbollah not to intervene. According to Axios, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=459.76s)]
*  any decision by the U.S. to use force would depend on the scope of the possible Hezbollah [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=465.76s)]
*  attack and Israel's ability to respond. So Jay, tell us a little bit more about the regional [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=472.56s)]
*  concerns here. There's real worry this could become a two-front war. Yeah, I think there's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=478.88s)]
*  absolute worry that continues to grow and I want to say, Jonathan, so does the amount of troops and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=486.08s)]
*  equipment dedicated to that area by Israel. They are growing their footprint there and as you talked [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=491.84s)]
*  about, the volleys between the two sides have increased over the last couple of days with [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  soldiers on both sides lost and this is something that was a fear from the very beginning of this [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  conflict, something that the White House has made clear could bring in involvement from U.S. forces [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=508.23999999999995s)]
*  and it continues to escalate. So yeah, it is a big concern and one that being watched very closely, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=515.04s)]
*  obviously by everyone involved. Senior national correspondent for NBC News, Jay Gray live in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=520.48s)]
*  Tel Aviv for us. Thank you, stay safe. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S3FPqGsJlo&t=525.6800000000001s)]
