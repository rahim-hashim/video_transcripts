# Harris spends the final day of her campaign in Pennsylvania
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE)
*  So tonight I ask you one last time, are you ready to make your voices heard? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=0.0s)]
*  Do we believe in freedom? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=8.0s)]
*  Do we believe in opportunity? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=13.0s)]
*  Do we believe in the promise of America? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=17.0s)]
*  And are we ready to fight for it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=22.0s)]
*  You're going to say Kamala, you're horrible at your job, you don't know what you're doing, you're a low IQ individual, we want smart people, we want cunning people, we're dealing with the smartest people in the world. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=27.0s)]
*  We don't want you negotiating nuclear deals because you don't know what the word nuclear means. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=42.0s)]
*  Kamala, you're fired, get the hell out of here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=49.0s)]
*  Two very different closing messages from both candidates on the final day of the presidential campaign. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=55.0s)]
*  We'll have a complete recap from the trail and get you ready for election day. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=63.0s)]
*  Also ahead, a look at the key races that could decide which party controls Congress next year. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=69.0s)]
*  Good morning and welcome to Way Too Early on this Tuesday, November 5th, election day in America. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=85.0s)]
*  I'm Jonathan Lemire, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=99.0s)]
*  It is our honor and privilege to get you started today on such an important day for our nation and its future. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=102.0s)]
*  We begin now with a few polling locations across the East Coast that are just beginning to open the doors to voters and many more will open up just an hour from now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=111.0s)]
*  In an election day tradition, residents in Dixville-Notch, New Hampshire cast their ballots for president shortly after midnight. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=120.0s)]
*  This year, it wasn't even split with three votes going to Vice President Kamala Harris and three going to former president Donald Trump. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=128.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris spent the last full day of her campaign in Battleground, Pennsylvania. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=137.0s)]
*  Harris traveled all the way across the Commonwealth, making stops in Scranton, Redding, Allentown, and Pittsburgh. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=143.0s)]
*  She visited local businesses and even, as you see here, knocked on some doors. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=150.0s)]
*  The vice president then ended her day with a star-studded rally in Philadelphia, standing on the city's famous Rocky Steps at the art museum there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=155.0s)]
*  Harris leaned into her image as an underdog in the race, and she aimed to spread a message of unity. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=164.0s)]
*  Our campaign has tapped into the ambitions and the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=173.0s)]
*  We are optimistic and we are excited about what we can do together. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=183.0s)]
*  And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=190.0s)]
*  And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=197.0s)]
*  However, the race ain't over yet. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=208.0s)]
*  And we must finish strong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=215.0s)]
*  And this could be one of the closest races in history. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=218.0s)]
*  And we will win because when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=224.0s)]
*  And we have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of politics that has been driven by fear and division. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=233.0s)]
*  We are done with that. We're done. We're exhausted with it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=248.0s)]
*  America is ready for a fresh start. Ready for a new way forward, where we see our fellow American not as an enemy, but as a neighbor. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=255.0s)]
*  So America, we started this campaign 107 days ago. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=271.0s)]
*  And from the beginning, ours has not been a fight against something, it has been a fight for something. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=278.0s)]
*  A fight for a future with freedom, with opportunity, and with dignity for all Americans. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=289.0s)]
*  Our campaign has brought together people from all corners of this nation, and from all walks of life, united by our love for our country, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=299.0s)]
*  and our faith in a brighter, stronger, and more hopeful future that we will build together. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=314.0s)]
*  And tonight, then we finish as we started, with optimism, with energy, with joy, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=325.0s)]
*  knowing that we the people have the power to shape our future, and that we can confront any challenge we face when we do it together. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=336.0s)]
*  America is ready for a fresh start. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EERN62OCQE&t=366.0s)]
