# Pence contradicts himself on supporting the GOP nominee
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs)
*  Welcome back. Mike Pence told a crowd at his campaign launch yesterday that Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=0.0s)]
*  should never be president again. But then, in an interview with Fox News just minutes [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  later, the former VP appeared to waver, saying he'd support whomever became the Republican [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=11.76s)]
*  nominee. Take a look. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=17.88s)]
*  Your party has laid out the criteria for the debate stage, and those debates are going [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=21.04s)]
*  important, as they always are, those primary debates. And one of the requirements is that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=26.4s)]
*  you vow to support whoever becomes the eventual nominee of your party. Have you considered [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  that, and will you commit to that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=40.16s)]
*  Well, I will absolutely support the Republican nominee for president in 2024, especially [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=43.84s)]
*  if it's me. I think we've got a great group of men and women running for this nomination. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=51.8s)]
*  I truly do believe that we've got better choices in the days ahead, and the enthusiasm that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=57.08s)]
*  we've met here traveling through Iowa and even here today, I believe, gives me great [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=64.44s)]
*  confidence that we'll be able to not just endorse but enthusiastically support the Republican [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=69.24s)]
*  nominee for president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=75.56s)]
*  Here in the day, Pence appeared at a CNN town hall where he was asked about that apparent [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=78.36s)]
*  contradiction. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=82.84s)]
*  You just spent a lot of time both here and earlier today explaining why you think that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=85.56s)]
*  the former president did not uphold his oath to the Constitution. So then how can you say [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=91.36s)]
*  that you would support him if he's the nominee? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=97.48s)]
*  Well, because I don't think Donald Trump's going to be the nominee in the Republican [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=99.56s)]
*  party. I don't think he's going to be the nominee. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=102.68s)]
*  What if he is? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=104.68s)]
*  I have great confidence in Republican primary voters. We have a field of strong and experienced [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=105.68s)]
*  candidates that grew by one today. And I truly do believe that people here in Iowa are going [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=111.68s)]
*  to recognize the challenges that we're facing and understand that different times call for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  different leadership. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen sporting a terrific [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  new beard. Jonathan, great to see you. The GOP field has certainly gotten more crowded [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=133.32s)]
*  here in recent days. Chris Christie's in. Vice President Pence is in. And Pence took [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=138.12s)]
*  his strongest stance yet against his former boss. But as we just heard, he and so many [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  others are in this moment where they can't go all the way, it seems, to totally disavow [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=147.48s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=152.16s)]
*  So walk us through that dynamic. And I know it's informed in part because of that pledge [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=153.16s)]
*  you got to take to get on the debate stage, although how binding is that really? Just [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  give us your sense of these early days of Pence and his new tactic about taking on Trump. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=161.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right, Jonathan. I mean, all of these candidates are going to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=164.76s)]
*  say that they're going to support the Republican nominee for president. The difference is that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=169.32s)]
*  it would be shocking if Mike Pence did not do that, him being such a party loyalist for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  all of his years. And yet, yesterday he goes out there, hits Donald Trump as hard as he's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=179.32s)]
*  hit him before, saying he should never be president again, and basically saying Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=184.44s)]
*  was on the wrong side of the Constitution. Pence casting himself as somebody who was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=190.84s)]
*  faithful to his oath on January 6th and Trump as somebody who was not, and also saying Donald [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=195.32s)]
*  Trump has abandoned conservatism on abortion and other issues. The problem here for Mike [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=200.56s)]
*  Pence, of course, is that he's going to lose the support of Republican voters if he says [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=205.6s)]
*  that he wouldn't support the Republican nominee and even more might not get on that debate [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  stage. It's kind of a pickle for him and it's hard for people to reconcile logically how [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=218.44s)]
*  he could say Donald Trump was fighting against the Constitution on January 6th and then trying [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=223.24s)]
*  to overturn the 2020 election and then turns around and says, well, you know, but if he's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  the Republican nominee, you know, that's better than whoever the Democrat would be. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=232.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be the bind that so many of these candidates. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=236.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcebfbUdJs&t=248.24s)]
