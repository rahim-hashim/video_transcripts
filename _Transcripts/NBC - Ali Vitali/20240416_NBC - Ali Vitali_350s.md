# Biden hits Pennsylvania, Trump hits New York courtroom
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k)
*  President Biden will travel to Pennsylvania today for a campaign rally in his hometown of Scranton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=0.0s)]
*  The president's campaign says he'll give a speech on economic policy with a major focus on taxes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=5.76s)]
*  The president will highlight that Donald Trump's plan would result in up to three and a half million [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=11.92s)]
*  dollars in cuts for some of the wealthiest Americans, which is 70 times what a typical [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=17.44s)]
*  family in Scranton makes in an entire year. Today's visit is the start of a three-day swing in the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  vital battleground state for President Biden. Joining us now, White House reporter for Bloomberg, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=28.16s)]
*  Akaila Gardner. Akaila, good morning, good to see you again. So the economy has been a tough sell [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=34.0s)]
*  for President Biden throughout this campaign. As you well know, his campaign advisors point to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=39.76s)]
*  metrics and say, look, things are actually going pretty well. Remember where we started with the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=46.16s)]
*  pandemic. But last week's inflation news certainly dealt that narrative a blow. Tell us, how does the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=50.24s)]
*  campaign intend to turn the message around? Yeah, the president is going to be in Pennsylvania for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=55.28s)]
*  three days. This is something that we have not really seen him do yet with a single state. If he [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=61.28s)]
*  spends this much time on the road, he's usually hitting multiple states, but he's in his home [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=65.36s)]
*  state of Scranton or he'll be going to Scranton, his home state of Pennsylvania, before he heads [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=69.44s)]
*  to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. These are two of the biggest cities in the state. All of them are [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  blue. But as you mentioned, the issue of the economy still weighs heavy on voters hearts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=79.52s)]
*  The campaign and the White House have really tried to remind voters what the country was like in 2020, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=85.28s)]
*  the raging pandemic, job losses. And yet they feel as though they have had a strong recovery. But that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  is something that is still hard for voters to swallow who are seeing higher prices at their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  grocery store on rent. And they're really going to have to push that conversation forward. And I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=101.28s)]
*  think that is exactly what the president is trying to do today. He's talking about his tax policies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=105.6s)]
*  He wants to restore the child tax credit and he's promising not to raise taxes for Americans who [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=110.24s)]
*  make more than four hundred thousand dollars a year. So he's really going to have to drive home [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  this issue, particularly on the economy, especially in the Blue Wall, Pennsylvania, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=118.96s)]
*  Michigan and Wisconsin. And hard to see president being reelected if he can't win all three of those [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=123.28s)]
*  states and such important emphasis being placed on turning out those Philadelphia suburbs, but also [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=128.16s)]
*  black voters in places like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia itself. We'll be watching his [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=134.0s)]
*  campaign swing this week. Let's hit a few other topics now, Kayla. So late yesterday, Speaker [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=138.0s)]
*  Johnson unveiled new plans for four days suggesting separating them into separate bills. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=142.96s)]
*  Give us a sense as to what is the White House's early reaction. Is this something they're going [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=148.96s)]
*  to support? This is something the White House is strongly against. They do not want to see a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=153.2s)]
*  standalone bill on either Israel or Ukraine. There is a reason that these two issues were [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=158.24s)]
*  tied together in that Senate bipartisan bill because they really feel like they can leverage [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=163.28s)]
*  both of those. They have the support of the Senate. They have House members who really support [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=168.0s)]
*  aid to Israel. So this is something that they want to see continue to tie together along with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=172.56s)]
*  funding for the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan. But of course, Speaker Mike Johnson says this could come [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=176.88s)]
*  to a vote on Friday and he expects all three of those issues to be separate. And he might have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=181.76s)]
*  some leverage here after he just appeared with Donald Trump and Mar-a-Lago on Friday, who of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=186.72s)]
*  course has been against Ukraine aid. But if he's able to convince some of these ultra conservative [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=191.2s)]
*  Republicans that Trump may be comfortable with this or giving his vote of confidence for him [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  to go forward, he might be able to pull this off. Yeah. Israel seems certain to pass Ukraine's the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=200.64s)]
*  issue. Also, even if he can get through the House, the Senate probably not going to love this either. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=206.0s)]
*  They already have a bill that they signed off on. We'll be watching that this week as well. So [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  Akilah, an interesting dynamic here. Former President Trump, he was in New York courthouse [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=215.92s)]
*  yesterday. He's going back today. He's going to be there a lot in recent weeks. The president [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=219.6s)]
*  himself has made clear he doesn't want to talk about Trump's legal issues. He wants to keep a [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=225.04s)]
*  line between the White House and any matter with the Department of Justice or any local [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=230.4s)]
*  jurisdiction. But how does the campaign, the Biden campaign and its surrogates, Democrats, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  how do they intend to capitalize on this and drawing this contrast? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=239.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's been interesting to see this because the Biden campaign has really followed the lead [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=244.72s)]
*  of the president here and the White House. They do not want to specifically talk about any of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=248.08s)]
*  Trump's legal woes. And I think that's partly because Trump has tried to paint this as a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=252.4s)]
*  politically motivated attack against them. And that's not something that they want to feed into. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=256.56s)]
*  But yet they're very much enjoying this contrast of President Biden continuing to be on the trail, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=260.16s)]
*  continuing to have that flexibility. And they also believe they have been very strong when it comes [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=265.2s)]
*  to fundraising, as well as campaign advertising on television and really building out some of these [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=269.6s)]
*  field offices. They are planning to open over 100 field offices across the country. So this is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=275.44s)]
*  something that they feel they are way ahead in terms of Donald Trump. And they're really [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=280.08s)]
*  being able to beat some of these early concerns that we heard from Democrats and within the party [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=284.24s)]
*  that they had this slow start to the campaign. And yet Trump has really not been able to catch up [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=288.88s)]
*  when it comes to that ground game. And this is something that they feel they are very strong [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=293.6s)]
*  with going forward. And it does feel like a bit of a pivotal moment here as we're finally seeing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=297.36s)]
*  Trump tied to a courtroom day after day. And what's the president doing? Engaging on a three-day [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=301.84s)]
*  barnstorming swing through a vital battleground state, this time Pennsylvania. That in itself [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=306.32s)]
*  might be the contrast they want. We really appreciate all the ground covered for us this [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=310.56s)]
*  morning by White House reporter for Bloomberg News, Akaila Gardner. Akaila, thank you again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnjr2m1E6k&t=314.15999999999997s)]
