# Rep. George Santos to face expulsion vote on Friday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s)
*  We also want to ask you about George Santos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=0.0s)]
*  His expulsion vote is tomorrow. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=3.24s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson says that he has real reservations about kicking out the freshman [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=5.42s)]
*  lawmaker. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=10.98s)]
*  But let me tell you, let me play for you what some of their Republican colleagues are saying. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=11.98s)]
*  I served on the ethics committee for a year. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=18.62s)]
*  There's a couple things that are kind of sacrosanct. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=21.22s)]
*  Campaign money and those type of things are there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=24.78s)]
*  He refused to cooperate with him and all of those things. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=27.26s)]
*  I mean, our due process at the ethics committee, the report's pretty damning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=30.46s)]
*  So I'm going to vote to expel him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=33.620000000000005s)]
*  And do you expect this to be the last week of George Santos? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  I don't know who George Santos is. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=37.7s)]
*  Yes, yes, we do. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  Do you guys have enough votes to oust him? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  I think so. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=42.660000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I think there'll be 120, 150 Republican votes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=43.66s)]
*  Do you expect this to be the last week of George Santos? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=46.46s)]
*  Oh, I certainly hope so. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  I just can't wait to be rid of him. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  I'll be voting to expel Santos. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=52.1s)]
*  He's a crook. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=53.58s)]
*  All right, Anna, I'll put to you the question that was just posed to one of the lawmakers [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=55.58s)]
*  there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=59.26s)]
*  What's your best sense of it? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=60.26s)]
*  Do Republicans, are there enough Republican votes to contribute to a total to expel George [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=61.26s)]
*  Santos? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=66.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think the idea that there was reservations around this kind of precedent setting vote [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=67.94s)]
*  for many Republicans in particular, and put to the side now that you have this ethics [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=74.86s)]
*  report that's very damning in terms of just laying out in explicit detail all of the different [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=80.06s)]
*  areas where George Santos, nothing else, certainly maybe acted in a legal manner, but was not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=85.7s)]
*  doing the behavior of unfit or unbecoming of a member of Congress. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=92.94s)]
*  Clearly looks like he will be expelled on Friday. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=98.94s)]
*  And as much as Johnson, the speaker said, he has reservations about the president, it [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=103.14s)]
*  is also a vote of conscience and Republican leadership aren't whipping against this vote. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=107.94000000000001s)]
*  So all signs point to George Santos being expelled by the end of the week. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  And it certainly seems like a seat that Democrats may feel pretty good about picking up next [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=117.7s)]
*  year. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer, thank you as always. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMvJMT3EL9s&t=123.02000000000001s)]
