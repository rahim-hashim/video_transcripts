# Rove rips Trump for promising to pardon Jan. 6 rioters
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI)
*  Former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, Karl Rove, is offering a withering new criticism of Donald Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=0.0s)]
*  In a recent interview with MSNBC's Ari Melber, which first aired on the network last night, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=5.8s)]
*  Rove tore into Trump for his calls to pardon those who stormed the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=10.72s)]
*  What those people did when they violently attacked the Capitol in order to stop a constitutionally mandated meeting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=18.8s)]
*  of the Congress to accept the results of the Electoral College is a stain on our history. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=25.52s)]
*  And every one of those sons of b****** who did that, we ought to find them, try them, and send them to jail. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=30.88s)]
*  And one of the critical mistakes made in this campaign is that Donald Trump has now said, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm going to pardon those people because they're hostages. No, they're not. They're thugs. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=45.36s)]
*  I'm a Republican. I don't want to have a Democrat president. I want to have a Republican president. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=51.36s)]
*  But we're facing as a country a decision and everybody gets to make it as to what kind of leadership we're going to have. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=55.92s)]
*  And to me, it is a mistake on the part of the Trump campaign to allow the president's impulses to identify himself [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  with the people who assaulted the Capitol rather than people who stand for law and order. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=70.08s)]
*  So pretty strong words there. And Rove has been critical of Trump before. But Eugene, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  what's the Biden campaign's approach here? There are obviously a lot of very, there are some [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=80.56s)]
*  Republicans who are deeply critical of Donald Trump. We've Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney, Carl Rove. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=85.28s)]
*  How does the Biden campaign plan to utilize their words and potentially even get them to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=91.44s)]
*  appear on behalf of the current president? It was also Chris Christie. There are all these [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  senators who have stayed away from Donald Trump and criticized him. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=103.6s)]
*  these kind of folks. And right there we're looking at our colleague, Jonathan Martin did this amazing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=111.52s)]
*  column asking this exact question. Why hasn't Biden called Christie? And we talked to campaign [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=118.0s)]
*  officials. What they say essentially is that their focus right now is on the voters, right? That they [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=124.16s)]
*  are talking to Republican voters. You have seen ads where they are obviously leaning into [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=128.8s)]
*  the words of Republicans, people who have run against Donald Trump in what was supposed to be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  a competitive primary and has since dropped out. And they'll probably use Carl Rove's words in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  order to do that. The question is whether or not they're actually going to reach out to the people. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  And I think what's on their mind is nowadays everyone kind of has an opinion on Joe Biden [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=154.32s)]
*  and Donald Trump. And so asking Chris Christie or having someone like Carl Rove, I guess on the stump [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=160.64s)]
*  for them, would not be as, would maybe not be as useful as it was in the old days. But we also have [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=167.04s)]
*  to look to 2020 when they had the Ohio, former Ohio Governor John Kasich at the actual convention, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=173.6s)]
*  Cindy McCain, who now works as ambassador with the administration at the convention. So it's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=180.96s)]
*  likely they will do something like that again. But they don't seem that interested in reaching [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=188.56s)]
*  out to the lawmakers or the folks at the top of the, or what used to be the top of the Republican [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=193.44s)]
*  Party, and more so focusing on talking to those kind of independent-minded Republican voters or [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=198.96s)]
*  moderate voters at this point. Yeah, we can certainly see if that strategy changes in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=204.24s)]
*  months ahead. Politico's Eugene Daniels, thank you for starting us off this morning. We really [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abWwAkMPpxI&t=208.08s)]
