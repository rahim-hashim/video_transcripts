# Senate votes on $95B foreign aid bill
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s)
*  Welcome back. As we look again live now to Capitol Hill where at this very moment senators [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=0.0s)]
*  have begun voting on the final passage of the $95 billion foreign aid bill that includes [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=7.54s)]
*  support for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Some Senate Republicans vehemently opposed the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=12.96s)]
*  bill and gave hour-long speeches overnight to delay the inevitable passage because the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  legislation did not include border provisions stronger than the bipartisan border package [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=23.48s)]
*  they already rejected. Mind you, a package crafted by their fellow Republicans. Joining [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=28.5s)]
*  us now, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, our friend Richard Haas. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=33.46s)]
*  Richard, good morning. So we just showed those live pictures from the Senate floor. The voting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=38.54s)]
*  is underway. It does appear set to pass, but seems very unlikely to then get through the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=44.82s)]
*  House. Speaker Johnson once again last night suggested he was opposed. So if that is the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=53.06s)]
*  case, if this aid falls through, talk to us about the risks for Ukraine in particular. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=58.18s)]
*  It would have thought the biggest split in Washington would be between Senate and House [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=63.58s)]
*  Republicans, Jonathan. Look, the obvious risk to Ukraine we're already seeing, which is a shortage [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=68.3s)]
*  of ammunition, a shortage of arms. Ukraine has already pretty much shifted to a less resource [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=74.7s)]
*  intensive defensive strategy, but even that is going to be hard to feed adequately if the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  United States doesn't provide significant amounts of aid. The Europeans simply don't have the stocks [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=86.82s)]
*  or the production capability in order to others around the world to fill the gap. So gradually, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=92.82s)]
*  Russia will begin to regain territory. And that's essentially where we are. It kills any chance of [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=99.66s)]
*  diplomacy because the Russians will see no reason to do it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=106.5s)]
*  I think we lost Richard's audio for a moment. We'll work to get that back. But certainly, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=110.42s)]
*  there's a lot of concern issued from Kiev about running out of weapons, running out of munitions, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=121.22s)]
*  running out of supplies. And this also comes at a moment where there's a sense of momentum for Russia [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=128.18s)]
*  because of what Donald Trump said over the weekend, where he has suggested that he'd [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=133.74s)]
*  encourage Moscow to attack NATO allies, Ukraine not in NATO, but to go one step further, attack NATO [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=137.58s)]
*  allies if they don't pay their dues. And of course, we've been fact checking that for a few days now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=144.46s)]
*  There's no dues in that way. And these European countries have upped their spending, although not [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=150.3s)]
*  all, perhaps to the 2% commitment that some had made. We are continuing to watch now the voting on [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=154.78s)]
*  this $95 billion foreign aid bill. As mentioned, Speaker Johnson last night said, though, that it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=162.62s)]
*  won't get anywhere in the House. And on the subject, of course, on foreign policy, this also [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4aXZoNEJ9s&t=167.82s)]
