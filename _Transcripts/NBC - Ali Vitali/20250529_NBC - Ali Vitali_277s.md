Video Description: CJ Warnke, communications director for House Majority PAC, joins Way Too Early to discuss new Democratic ads targeting 26 GOP-held districts. The ads hit Republicans over the budget bill passed last week, which Warnke says included “the largest cut to Medicaid in American history.” Warnke adds the combined support for tariffs, SNAP cuts, and Medicaid reductions is a “deadly combo” politically heading into 2026.

# Democrats launch ad blitz after House GOP vote for ‘largest cut to Medicaid in American history’
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A)
*  How might the budget bill passed by House Republicans last week impact you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=0.0s)]
*  That's a question Democrats are zeroing in on right now as they launch an ad war against Republicans over the bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=5.0s)]
*  House Majority Forward, a nonprofit affiliated with Democratic leadership's House Majority PAC, has rolled out new ads in 26 congressional districts. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=11.0s)]
*  The ads hit House Republicans for their vote to cut Medicaid spending. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=19.0s)]
*  Here's just one example. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=23.0s)]
*  There's one person who thinks everything in your life should cost more. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=26.0s)]
*  It's your congressman, Rob Bresnahan. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=30.0s)]
*  First, he backed the tariffs, causing prices to soar. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=33.0s)]
*  Now he's sticking you with an even bigger bill. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=36.0s)]
*  He just cast the deciding vote to raise the cost of your groceries and cut your health care, including Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the ultra rich. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=39.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Communications Director for the House Majority PAC, CJ Warnke. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=49.0s)]
*  CJ, there's a lot that was packed into the bill. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=53.0s)]
*  Now we're starting to get a sense of the way that Democrats are seeking to use it as a campaign issue, specifically in districts like Pennsylvania's 8th congressional, which flipped from blue to red just last November. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=56.0s)]
*  So talk a little bit about what you're seeing in polling and research that you guys have found that shows you this is the most effective message. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=68.0s)]
*  Yeah, and thank you for having me on this morning. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=75.0s)]
*  So as you know, as a former Capitol Hill reporter, last week, Republicans voted for a massive budget bill. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=77.0s)]
*  Many of them have said they didn't even read it, and it included the largest cut to Medicaid in American history. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=83.0s)]
*  It included so like a myriad of items that are going to raise costs on American families. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=90.0s)]
*  And basically the end result was also they could reward the ultra rich with a massive tax break. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=95.0s)]
*  And so yesterday we announced ads in over 25 congressional districts across the country, hitting them for their supportive tariffs, their support of this bill, and just how they're going to make American lives just so much worse. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=101.0s)]
*  You know, this is going to be a killer issue for the midterms. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=114.0s)]
*  Our messaging operation, our data operation, our focus group testing has shown time and time again Medicaid cuts unpopular, snap cuts unpopular, tariffs unpopular. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=118.0s)]
*  These three together proved to be kind of a deadly combo. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=129.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of Republicans come November of 2026 are going to be regretting their votes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=131.0s)]
*  And we heard, at least we've heard this privately, I certainly have because Capitol Hill is the Hotel California. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=135.0s)]
*  I can never actually check out and I am fully committed still there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=141.0s)]
*  But what I hear from Republicans is that there are some who are concerned, especially in frontline districts like these. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=144.0s)]
*  And when I say frontline, those are the areas that people like you are looking at for where Republicans could be vulnerable. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=150.0s)]
*  So talk a little bit about a few of the districts that you are targeting here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=156.0s)]
*  It's been a long effort because you guys have been trying to keep this soil fertile effectively politically. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we just watched Pennsylvania Rob Bresnahan, a freshman who's already come under a lot of fire for his stock trades, now coming under fire for raising costs on his constituents. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=165.0s)]
*  One of the largest Medicaid recipient districts in the country is California 22, represented by David Valdeo. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=175.0s)]
*  This is going to be a brutal vote for him. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=181.0s)]
*  We're trying to expand the map also. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=184.0s)]
*  We released an ad in North Carolina 11 yesterday for Rep. Chuck Edwards, the Asheville area seat. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=186.0s)]
*  He's come under fire recently for hitting his constituent with a clipboard. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=191.0s)]
*  So we're trying seats like that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=195.0s)]
*  Missouri 2 with Rep. Ann Wagner, Rob Whitman, Virginia 1, really trying to make this battlefield as big as possible because what they're doing is really harming a lot of Americans. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=197.0s)]
*  And it's already unpopular. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=207.0s)]
*  It's more unpopular than Trump's tax bill was at this time in the process in 2017. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=209.0s)]
*  So we think this is going to be a pretty effective hit over the next year and a half. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=214.0s)]
*  And I think the concern on the part of Republicans is this idea that they've already taken the vote for this on the House front, regardless of what changes the Senate makes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=218.0s)]
*  That's already a vote that's banked and that folks like you can then take and put into attack ads. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=227.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, 100 percent. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=232.0s)]
*  You're going to see this vote used in attack ads across the country next year. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=233.0s)]
*  It's probably going to be the most cited vote in the midterms next year. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah, because policy and politics live right next to each other at this point. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=242.0s)]
*  And this is the guidance from a lot of the Democratic arms, especially focused on flipping the House in 2026 communications director for the House Majority PAC. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=246.0s)]
*  C.J. Warren Key. Thank you for coming on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=254.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmgO5kpOM4A&t=268.0s)]
