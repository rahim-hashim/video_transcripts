# Some Republicans open to jailing Jan. 6 Committee members
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY)
*  We wanted to bring you one more headline from Capitol Hill now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=0.0s)]
*  Several House Republicans appeared to be open to the idea of seeing some of their colleagues, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=2.64s)]
*  those they serve with there on Capitol Hill, but those who were on the January 6th select committee [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  go to jail. The bulwark spoke to several congressional Republicans [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=14.32s)]
*  following this comment that Trump made on NBC's Meet the Press. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Cheney was behind it, and so was Benny Thompson, and everybody on that committee [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=24.16s)]
*  For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=30.08s)]
*  So you think Liz Cheney should go to jail? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=35.2s)]
*  For what they did? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=38.16s)]
*  Everyone on the committee you think should go to jail. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=38.72s)]
*  Anybody that voted in favor? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=40.88s)]
*  Are you going to direct your FBI director and your attorney general to send them to jail? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=42.0s)]
*  No, not at all. I think that they'll have to look at that, but I'm not going to, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=45.6s)]
*  I'm going to focus on drill baby drill. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=49.28s)]
*  Following those remarks by Trump, oversight committee chair James [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=53.04s)]
*  Comer told the bulwark this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=56.8s)]
*  With politicians, if you've used a congressional committee and you've lied [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=58.8s)]
*  and tried to set people up and falsely imprisoned people, then you should be held accountable. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Republican Congressman Tim Burchett said that committee members should be imprisoned if they [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=68.48s)]
*  broke the law and suggested without proof that the committee manipulated evidence. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=72.56s)]
*  And Congressman Lauren Boebert told the bulwark, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=79.36s)]
*  quote, it's not looking good for them, adding, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=82.56s)]
*  I think anybody who has politically imprisoned American citizens and completely ruined their [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=85.2s)]
*  lives needs to be investigated. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=89.44s)]
*  Let's just put a finer point on this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=91.36s)]
*  These again are Republican lawmakers who are saying they are okay with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=92.8s)]
*  their Democratic colleagues being imprisoned simply for doing their job, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=96.0s)]
*  presenting no evidence of wrongdoing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=99.6s)]
*  This is a lot of what people are afraid of as we think about a Trump era returning to Washington. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTbXnfoNPpY&t=102.08s)]
