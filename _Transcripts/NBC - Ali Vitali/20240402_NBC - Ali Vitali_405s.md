# Trump holding rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg)
*  Donald Trump will return to the campaign trail visiting the Midwest for his first official rallies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=0.0s)]
*  since clinching the 2024 Republican nomination nearly a month ago. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=5.76s)]
*  Trump is set to meet with state party leaders and then deliver a speech on what his campaign calls [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=11.68s)]
*  quote Biden's border bloodbath. Remember that outrage about bloodbath a few weeks ago? Yeah, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=17.12s)]
*  Trump is now totally leaning into that. That's what always happens. Trump will then head to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=22.32s)]
*  Green Bay, Wisconsin to deliver another speech on the day the state holds its presidential primaries. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=25.84s)]
*  Since Biden and Trump became their party's presumptive nominees last month, Biden has [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=30.64s)]
*  visited eight swing states while Trump zero. Ahead of that Wisconsin rally, Trump called into a local [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=34.96s)]
*  radio show yesterday where he falsely claimed to have won the state in 2020 and then spewed a lot [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=41.84s)]
*  of offensive rhetoric about migrants. Joining us now, NBC News, NBC News senior national politics [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=47.84s)]
*  reporter Jonathan Allen. John, good to see you. I hope you enjoyed opening day yesterday [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=54.96s)]
*  there in the nation's capital. Much has been made of Trump's rather light campaign schedule [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=60.24s)]
*  over this last month. Some of it because frankly his campaign is short of cash to put on these [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=66.8s)]
*  expensive rallies. They had to pull down one they're hoping to have in Arizona. But he's back on the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=71.6s)]
*  road today. Talk to us what we should expect to hear in as he visits two very important states, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=76.08s)]
*  Michigan and Wisconsin. He's going to Michigan to talk about border security. He hasn't been [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=81.2s)]
*  to Michigan since February 17th. Obviously Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, that sort of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=86.64s)]
*  industrial corridor has been pivotal in the last two presidential elections. So a state I think [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=93.92s)]
*  you're likely to see Donald Trump in a lot over the course of the next several months. And then [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=99.68s)]
*  in Wisconsin he's got a more traditional rally in Green Bay. And I'll be interested to hear what [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=104.24s)]
*  differences there may be in Wisconsin and if there is a difference in the messaging in Wisconsin than [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  there is in Michigan. But I would expect to hear a lot of grievance from Donald Trump. And this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=116.32s)]
*  sort of sets the tone for what we're going to see as trial begins April 15th in New York. We're [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=122.32s)]
*  going to see him on the road once, maybe twice a week when he gets breaks in the trial, either [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=128.8s)]
*  on the weekend or in the middle of the week. And you know otherwise we're going to see him in court. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=133.92s)]
*  So this is one of his last opportunities before that that moment to try to rally the troops. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah I think that dynamic is so interesting. First of all that he hasn't been out there on the road [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  in a while. This is going to be his first appearance in front of a crowd in quite some time. Who knows [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  what he'll say? We may have gotten a preview with his unhinged screed on Easter Sunday on Truth Social. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  But also he's going to be limited to what he can do because in two weeks time he's going to have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  to be in a courtroom each and every day. How is his campaign planning to manage that? I mean this [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=162.08s)]
*  has been the biggest challenge for them all along and they knew that it was going to come to a head [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=168.0s)]
*  you know at some point where the calendar is a major conflict for him. It limits what he can do. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  It limits where he can be. He's going to have to be in New York most of the time. Obviously he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=177.36s)]
*  prefers to be in Palm Beach or even in Bedminster you know close enough to commute to New York. But [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=181.84s)]
*  he's limited in fundraising. He's limited in his ability to go out on the campaign trail. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=188.08s)]
*  Certainly limited in his ability to go say to Arizona which is a longer trip than [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=193.68s)]
*  it is to Michigan or Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to do campaigning. So this is a logistical [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=199.12s)]
*  challenge for his campaign to be sure you know they're going to try to make sure that it's not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=204.16s)]
*  more than just a logistical challenge. That it doesn't prevent him from getting his message [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=209.76s)]
*  across where he wants to get it across. That it doesn't undercut his message. Obviously nobody [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=213.68s)]
*  wants to sit in a hush money case involving an alleged affair with a porn star. At least most [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  people wouldn't. And you know make sure it doesn't undercut him entirely. Yeah that's not campaigning [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=224.08s)]
*  101 to be sure. So let's talk about his fundraising. You know President Biden was in Wisconsin [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=229.68s)]
*  maybe two weeks back and while there the DNC announced happily that they were opening up about [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  three dozen campaign offices across the state. Trump doesn't have any. The Republicans don't [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=238.96s)]
*  have any. Not yet. So much this is because the cash deficit. Talk to us more about that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=243.36s)]
*  financial disadvantage. That's a huge financial disadvantage and the Trump folks say that they [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=247.52s)]
*  don't need as much money as Biden to win. And that's probably true. We've seen two elections [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  in 2016 and 2020 where Donald Trump was outspent and in one he won the election and one he lost [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=258.16s)]
*  the election. But there is a question about whether he's going to have enough money to compete. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=263.36s)]
*  He is diverting so much of the money that is devoted to his campaign apparatus. So not [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=268.08s)]
*  necessarily a campaign proper but the super PAC outside of it devoting so much money to lawyers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=273.68s)]
*  People who donate to him know that a lot of that money is going to end up with lawyers going to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=279.92s)]
*  end up defending him at court. So he's really behind the eight ball. The Biden campaign is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=283.52s)]
*  stockpiling cash and I think they're going to use that cash advantage to try to make Donald Trump [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=289.6s)]
*  make choices about where he's going to spend money. It is always better to have more money [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=294.64s)]
*  than less money in politics. And lastly John let's talk polls. We opened the show noting that Joe [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=298.64s)]
*  Biden has put up a little bit of a lead. It's a national polls. It's close but the trends are [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=304.8s)]
*  heading his way. We've seen that the same dynamic in a few battlegrounds particularly the three you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=309.28s)]
*  just mentioned. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan. How is the Trump campaign feeling about what [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=313.84s)]
*  appears to be some Biden momentum? It's very difficult to get them to speak in any way that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=318.56s)]
*  there's anything bad for Donald Trump at any time because they know that they'll be drummed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  out a Trump world if they do that. But the truth is you know it is rare to see movement in this [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  race and you're seeing it as you suggested certainly moderately but like you're seeing a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  significant and noticeable jump for Joe Biden. That is not good for Trump world. That's not good [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  for Donald Trump. And you know we'll see if that continues. It is you know over the course of the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=349.36s)]
*  Biden presidency there have not been a lot of periods of time where polling has looked good [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=354.56s)]
*  for him and certainly in the last few weeks it is getting a little bit better for him. So Democrats [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=359.76s)]
*  should be pleased with that. And if past is prologue we know that pressure political or legal [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  causes outbursts from Donald Trump. We'll be watching what he has to say tonight. Hey everyone [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tkGirFn3dg&t=370.08000000000004s)]
