**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg)
*  Welcome back. We have breaking news. The Russian news agency Interfax is reporting that a Wall [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=0.0s)]
*  Street Journal reporter has been detained on spying charges. According to Russia's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=5.64s)]
*  Federal Security Service, Ivan Gorshkovich, a reporter covering Russia, Ukraine and the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  former Soviet Union, has been, quote, suspected of espionage in the interests of the American [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=16.04s)]
*  government. Interfax notes that Gorshkovich, a U.S. citizen, could face up to 20 years [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=21.32s)]
*  in prison. The Wall Street Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=26.88s)]
*  We, of course, will be watching this story as it develops throughout the day. Elsewhere, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=31.52s)]
*  in regards to the war in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Chinese [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  leader Xi Jinping to visit his war-torn country. Zelensky extended an invitation to the Chinese [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=41.92s)]
*  president during an interview with the Associated Press this week while returning from touring [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  damaged regions in Ukraine. Answering questions in English on an array of topics, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=52.6s)]
*  Zelensky spoke about the current state of the war and ongoing diplomatic efforts. When asked [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=57.0s)]
*  if he'd invite Xi to Ukraine, Zelensky said he would. Quote, we are ready to see him here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now, senior correspondent for Yahoo News Michael Weiss. Michael, good morning. Let's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=68.36s)]
*  start with this breaking news. It certainly underlines the dangers that reporters have in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=74.44s)]
*  covering Russia and also to how the Kremlin has continued to crack down on any sort of independent [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=80.32s)]
*  media. Absolutely. By the way, I'm seeing the Wall Street Journal has their own piece now out [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=87.6s)]
*  confirming the Russian state's report that they have indeed detained one of their reporters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=92.96s)]
*  The FSB, the Federal Security Service, is the successor agency to the old Soviet KGB, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=98.64s)]
*  and these are the guys that essentially take hostages, American citizens that they then want [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=105.28s)]
*  to trade back to the United States in exchange for people who have actually committed crimes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  Most famously, we saw the trade of Victor Boot, one of the world's most notorious arms dealer for [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  women's basketball player several months ago who had made the mistake of traveling to Russia to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=121.2s)]
*  partake in a sporting event and was detained on drug charges. So this is not surprising at all, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=127.68s)]
*  Jonathan. And yeah, I mean, if you're a journalist who has to dig into stories, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=133.36s)]
*  the last byline that Grishkovich had was a great piece that was much circulated about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  Russia's cratering economy as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. That will have pissed off [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=142.72000000000003s)]
*  the Kremlin for sure. So you can only imagine a reporter with sources sniffing around, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=146.96s)]
*  asking questions. The FSB decides, okay, this looks like espionage to us, and they just round them up. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x--j-sPhOg&t=152.08s)]
