# How The Globe Is Reacting To WH Handling Of Coronavirus | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso)
*  The World Health Organization estimates that globally, one in 10 people may have contracted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=0.0s)]
*  the coronavirus. Just over 35 million people have been infected, though the WHO says the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=6.68s)]
*  number could be closer to 800 million. And the vast majority of the world remains at [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=12.06s)]
*  risk. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=18.56s)]
*  This comes as countries across Europe look to impose new restrictions to curb the spread [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=19.56s)]
*  of COVID-19. French authorities yesterday placed Paris on a maximum virus alert, closing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=24.28s)]
*  bars and banning festive gatherings, but allowing restaurants to remain open as infections [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=29.7s)]
*  spiked in recent days. Meanwhile, in Spain, authorities there moved to lock down the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=35.7s)]
*  capital, Madrid, imposing a ban on leaving the city. And in the UK, an Excel spreadsheet [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=40.58s)]
*  error has left nearly 16,000 cases unrecorded last week, leaving an incomplete picture of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=47.34s)]
*  the virus to spread and delaying efforts to contact trace. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=53.82s)]
*  Joining us now live from Brussels, Belgium, reporter for The New York Times, Matt Appuzzo. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=58.300000000000004s)]
*  Matt, good morning. It's great to have you on the show. I realize it's not quite so early [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=63.1s)]
*  where you are, but we really appreciate it nonetheless. I think a lot of us are wondering, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=67.66s)]
*  it's so hard to step back with the way the news cycle is here in the US and think about [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=74.14s)]
*  or spend time focusing on how it's being perceived abroad. So I'm just curious, what has your [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=80.42s)]
*  experience been there of watching what's happened to the president of the United States [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=86.86s)]
*  over the course of the last couple days? And is there a level of concern about the national [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=90.82s)]
*  security implications of that as well? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=97.42s)]
*  Sure. I think obviously the health of the president is really important to governments [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=100.46s)]
*  around the world. Everybody benefits from a stable, healthy president in the White House, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=108.1s)]
*  no matter who it is. The thing that I'm hearing and the thing that I think is really on the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=114.66s)]
*  lips of everybody here in Europe is when you look back over generations post World War [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=119.38s)]
*  II, right, the United States and Western and top public health officials around the world [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=125.22s)]
*  have always been in lockstep on national public health, international public health emergencies. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  And so they were really taken aback by the president coming out of the hospital and saying, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=136.78s)]
*  I'm not going to worry about COVID. It's really the opposite of the language that public health [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=140.34s)]
*  officials and national leaders are trying to get people to understand here as we battle this new wave. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=145.22s)]
*  Matt, to that very point, I mean, and we saw Boris Johnson, obviously, who also was sidelined [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=153.34s)]
*  with coronavirus, come out of the hospital with a much different message and in fact sort of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=159.3s)]
*  redirect some of the policies that he was following and underscoring in the wake of his own [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=162.94s)]
*  illness. Is there a sense that the U.S. has permanently lost its position as global public [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=168.02s)]
*  health leader? I mean, I think all of us certainly here in the U.S. are pretty disappointed and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  flabbergasted that we're not leading the world on this because the assumption used to be that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=182.34s)]
*  America would lead. Well, I mean, if you look at the raw numbers, we're up there with Brazil and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=187.06s)]
*  India and the language that's coming out of the White House is not in line with where the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=196.02s)]
*  World Health Organization is. We're talking now about the United States pulling out of the World [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=204.02s)]
*  Health Organization at a time when most national health, excuse me, most international health [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=208.26s)]
*  officials would say it's more important than ever to have a lockstep, unified approach to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=214.34s)]
*  combating a pandemic. So it's certainly not where the United States has been on public health [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=222.34s)]
*  over generations and presidents of both parties. You look at what President Bush did on AIDS and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=228.26s)]
*  you look at the Ebola response, it's been a change. It's obviously a significant change. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=236.34s)]
*  All right, the New York Times, Matt Appuzzo with The View from Brussels. Thank you very much. It's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=243.62s)]
*  always great to see you, my friend. Hope to see you again soon. Hey there, I'm Chris Hayes from [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FRuPtjAUso&t=247.06s)]
