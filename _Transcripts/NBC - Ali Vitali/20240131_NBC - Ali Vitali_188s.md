# House GOP advance impeachment articles against Secy. Mayorkas
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk)
*  In a late-night vote, House Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee approved two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=0.0s)]
*  articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=5.28s)]
*  That move now sends the vote to the House floor, where lawmakers can decide the secretary's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=10.86s)]
*  fate as soon as next week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=14.6s)]
*  The committee says that Mayorkas, quote, willfully and systemically refuse to comply with federal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=17.0s)]
*  laws over his handling of the border. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  If the vote succeeds, Mayorkas would be the first cabinet member to be impeached since [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=24.6s)]
*  1876. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=28.68s)]
*  But it's unlikely to gain any traction in the Democratic-led Senate, where it most certainly [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=31.02s)]
*  will fail and Mayorkas will keep his job. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=35.92s)]
*  He never testified on his own behalf because he and the committee couldn't agree on a date. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=38.22s)]
*  Democrats have slammed the Russia proceedings as a political stunt. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=43.24s)]
*  The sham impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas is a baseless political stunt by extreme mega-Republicans. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=48.32s)]
*  Benjamin Greene, Representative Margaret Taylor Greene, and others have pushed for and even [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=56.12s)]
*  fundraised based on this pre-planned, predetermined scapegoating of the secretary. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=61.92s)]
*  The extreme mega-Republicans who are running the House of Representatives are deeply unserious [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=68.6s)]
*  people. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=74.16s)]
*  They don't want progress. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=75.16s)]
*  They don't want solutions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=77.4s)]
*  They want a political issue. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=79.28s)]
*  And most of all, they want to please their disgraced former president. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=81.2s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jake Ockenclus of the great state, great Commonwealth [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  of Massachusetts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=93.84s)]
*  Congressman, great to see you this morning. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=94.84s)]
*  Let's get your reactions to this hearing, the move to impeach Mayorkas, and talk to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=97.44s)]
*  us about also the context here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  They're trying to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary, who's trying to safeguard the southern [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=103.44s)]
*  At the same time, the Republicans look like they're on the verge of scuttling a bill that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=109.2s)]
*  would dramatically improve border security. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=113.56s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  It's nice to be with you again. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  I agree with what ranking member Thompson said in that clip. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=120.4s)]
*  It's a farce. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=124.84s)]
*  Impeachment is reserved for high crimes and misdemeanors, like, for example, when a president [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=126.6s)]
*  tries to overturn a free and fair election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=131.52s)]
*  That's the kind of thing you impeach somebody for. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=133.44s)]
*  Impeachment is not for policy disagreements. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=136.0s)]
*  If the Republicans have policy disagreements on the border, there is right now good faith [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  bipartisan negotiations on a tough, fair border security measure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=143.44s)]
*  However, Republicans have said that that measure is dead on arrival in the House of Representatives [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  while they pursue on a separate track this impeachment that has no basis in factor law. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  So it tells the American people that the Republicans want to campaign on the border. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=159.68s)]
*  They do not want to govern on the border. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg0QU3DpYMk&t=165.64s)]
