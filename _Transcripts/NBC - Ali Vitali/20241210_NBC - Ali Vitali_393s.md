# House debates stopgap funding bill as government shutdown looms
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI)
*  Congress has just over a week to agree on a government funding bill before a shutdown's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=0.0s)]
*  triggered next Friday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=4.44s)]
*  While both chambers are likely to pass a short-term measure that will keep the government's lights [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  on through March, House Speaker Mike Johnson will face opposition from the right wing of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=11.16s)]
*  his party. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=15.92s)]
*  Conservatives have consistently been against stopgap funding bills, which means Democrats [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=17.48s)]
*  may have a card to play in the coming days. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=22.8s)]
*  According to Politico, Democrats will support the stopgap bill if it includes a robust [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  package to address disaster relief across the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=30.0s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Ali Vitale. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=34.36s)]
*  Ali, good to see you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  But let's start right there about this government shutdown deal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Do your sources think that there's any chance the government will shut down? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  And then let's talk more about this dilemma that Speaker Johnson finds himself in. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=47.84s)]
*  The dilemma that Johnson finds himself in is a thorny one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  But on your first question, no, there's not a prevailing belief that the government is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=55.36s)]
*  going to shut down around Christmas, let alone. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=59.28s)]
*  So we are pretty safe in that perspective. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=61.88s)]
*  But as usual, you look at the fact that you've got about a week to solve this thing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=64.16s)]
*  Lawmakers are going to be eager to go home for the holidays. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=67.52s)]
*  But a week is a long time in Congress time, and so they're going to get to a deal. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=70.2s)]
*  You're right that the broad contours at this point will fund the government until around [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  March. There are some conservatives that are pushing till April. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=78.64s)]
*  But it does seem like the belief around the Hill is that this is going to be a March stopgap [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=82.08s)]
*  spending bill. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=86.84s)]
*  But the politics of this are really difficult for Johnson, because while Democrats are coming [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  forward and saying, hey, we'll help you bridge those tight margins with a few votes of our [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=91.64s)]
*  own, if we have a robust disaster relief bill on the other side of the equation, House [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=95.92s)]
*  Freedom Caucus members, that ultra conservative crew are back there saying they want to make [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=101.12s)]
*  sure that package is as tight as possible and not more broad in its spending scope. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=105.76s)]
*  That's not shocking. That's something that the speaker has told me he's talking to those [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  members about. But it does put him in a precarious position not to avert a government shutdown, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=115.12s)]
*  because at the end of the day, Democrats will go along with that one. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  It puts him in a tough spot, though, for January 3rd when they actually do those speaker [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=123.72s)]
*  elections. Johnson needs to placate all parts of his conference. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=128.84s)]
*  And we know that that conference has shrunk in size. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=133.16s)]
*  This is going to be a game that we're watching them play at the end of the year for obvious [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=136.28s)]
*  reasons, that Democrats need to cross party lines and vote to keep the government open with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=140.8s)]
*  Republicans, but also because the margin that Republicans are going to have going into [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=144.64s)]
*  the next Congress is going to be even slimmer. That provides possibilities for Democrats [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=148.64s)]
*  who might want to do things in bipartisan fashion. But it also presents some real difficulties [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=153.6s)]
*  for the speaker. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=158.55999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, really foreshadow some of the trouble he's going to have in the months ahead. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=159.55999999999997s)]
*  So let's talk about a couple of Trump's cabinet picks now, starting with Pete Hegseth, who [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=163.6s)]
*  has been on the Hill repeatedly in recent days. Had him, as we just discussed with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  Brandon Buck, met with Senator Ernst yesterday. What's the latest your sources are saying? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=173.12s)]
*  Is he making inroads with those GOP senators who might not yet be convinced? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=177.72s)]
*  Well, you know, the Hill really does shift on the mood that you can feel sometimes in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  the hallways. And I can tell you, last week, it really felt like Hegseth's nomination was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=186.8s)]
*  sort of dead on arrival at this point. Now it feels like with each new turn of the wheel, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  we're seeing Hegseth now in a more positive position, in large part because we're seeing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=197.24s)]
*  that Ernst's ire, what it might have been at the end of last week, is now not nearly [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=201.88s)]
*  as palpable as it seemed. She's putting out a little bit lengthier readouts of their [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=206.6s)]
*  conversations. The fact that they met again yesterday, I think to many people is being [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=211.04s)]
*  seen as a positive sign. But there's a long way to go. And I think Brendan made the right [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=215.56s)]
*  calculus when you guys were talking earlier about the political concerns for someone like [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=220.28s)]
*  Ernst, who is one of those 2026 Senate Republicans. They would likely face primaries much more [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=224.56s)]
*  quickly if they were to oppose these kinds of nominations. But I do think that we shouldn't [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=229.92s)]
*  get over our skis when we see that Ernst is saying she will support the process, because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=234.64s)]
*  the process is saying, I'm not going to put a wedge in this right now in December. That's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=239.24s)]
*  not to say that she's not going to come out of this in January, whenever they do the actual [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=243.96s)]
*  confirmation process and the vote and say, no, at the end of the day, I can't get there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=249.04s)]
*  What she's saying now is, yeah, let's let them go through, keep letting them have meetings, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=253.0s)]
*  let them get to a hearing, and then the decision will be made. And quite frankly, that's been [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=256.6s)]
*  the vibe that I've heard from Republican senators, whether they were talking about Matt [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  Gates, whether they're talking about now Hegseth, who's now the new, new embattled member of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=264.20000000000005s)]
*  this cabinet. And so that, I think, is what we should see, is that she's fine letting [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  it go ahead, but she's not necessarily a yes, at least not yet. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=274.16s)]
*  And we'll have to see how the Hegseth drama impacts some of the others, like Tulsi Gabbard [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=277.56s)]
*  and Cash Mattel, who also will face some scrutiny. And Ali, before you go, some personal news regarding [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=282.88s)]
*  this very show. Ali, a big congratulations to you. You will be taking over the reins [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  as host of Way Too Early, starting in early January. I will say it has been such an honor [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=294.11999999999995s)]
*  to host the show the last three years. I can't thank the team here enough for all their work, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=299.0s)]
*  and I am so glad it will be in such good hands. You can hear the cheers. You can hear the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=303.28s)]
*  cheers. I'm clapping for them and for you all the way here from Washington. I am so [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  thrilled to bring the show back to D.C. And I'm so thrilled to take it from you. I mean, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=312.56s)]
*  you and I have been friends going back to the 2016 election, following then-candidate [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=316.48s)]
*  Trump on his plane, flying all over the country, seeing that up close on the front lines. I [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=322.0s)]
*  mean, you and I have been through it all. And I'm so, so thankful and thrilled to take [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=327.16s)]
*  the show from you, to take it over with Joe. And for Lamir, he gets a new, you get your [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=331.64s)]

*  Well, we're very thrilled for you, and make no mistake of it. Jonathan is very excited [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=341.92s)]
*  to be on Morning Joe. But yeah, thank you. Thank you, Mika. I'm so excited. He would [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=346.84s)]
*  have been much happier if we'd just gotten Soto. And a couple good pictures. That's $750 [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=353.64s)]
*  million. It wasn't my money. Good as mad. We can't wait, Ali. Congratulations. Thank [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=357.96s)]
*  you, guys. I can't wait either. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Joe. And thank you, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwmuZBWRzYI&t=362.92s)]
