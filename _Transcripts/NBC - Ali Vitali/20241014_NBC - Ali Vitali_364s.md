# Trump suggests woman heckler at rally should 'get the hell knocked out of her'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw)
*  Welcome back. It is Coachella rally on Saturday in California. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Trump suggested that a woman heckling at him during a speech should be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=5.12s)]
*  physically harmed. The woman interrupted Trump as he spoke and was escorted out right behind [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=10.02s)]
*  him on stage. Let's take a look at how that situation unfolded. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Republican or independent, this election is your chance to send a message. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=19.68s)]
*  Back home to mommy, she goes back home to mommy. Was that you darling? And then she [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=26.68s)]
*  gets the hell knocked out of it. Her mother's a big fan of ours. You know that, right? Her [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=33.68s)]
*  father, her mother. No, you always have that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=40.68s)]
*  Joining us now, author, columnist, and conservative writer Matt Lewis. Matt, just a fleeting moment [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=63.68s)]
*  if you will, but perhaps one that is illustrative. We know that Trump has promoted violence on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=68.76s)]
*  the campaign trail. He did it in 2016. He did it in 2020. He inspired a riot on January [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=73.68s)]
*  6th. He's still doing it now. What's your level of concern that his rhetoric as it grows [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  only angrier and darker in the stretch run of this election could inspire more violence [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=84.92s)]
*  before, during, or after election day? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=90.16000000000001s)]
*  Look, you're right. He's been doing this for like nine years. I think back in maybe 2015 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=93.24s)]
*  when he started doing these televised rallies, offered to even pay for the legal expenses [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=99.44s)]
*  of fans of his who would beat up protesters. So this is not a new thing. But I do feel [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=105.92s)]
*  like things, we've become anured to it. We've become used to it. And I do think that the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  most dangerous possibility, of course, would be if he were to lose the election and were [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=119.16s)]
*  to claim that it was stolen from him. I think that is probably the most dangerous scenario. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=123.92s)]
*  And clearly he will be continuing to stoke violent rhetoric. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=131.72s)]
*  Let's stay on that topic of his rhetoric. I mean, it's been dark for a long time, but [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=136.8s)]
*  it's going to new lows, if you will, now, particularly the way he talks about migrants [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  and the way he dehumanizes these people on suggesting that the United States is an occupied [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=147.48s)]
*  nation, lying, but doing so in a way that stokes fears, the praise on racism, that promotes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=153.2s)]
*  falsehoods. I mean, we are in a really dangerous, dark place. Respond to that, Matt, and respond [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=160.56s)]
*  also, frankly, how about half the country seems to be responding to it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. It is working. That's the thing. It is working. And look, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=171.84s)]
*  I think some of this is just frankly, we are evolutionarily wired to have a negativity [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=177.8s)]
*  bias. If that noise you heard rustling, if you dismiss it all, that's nothing. You are [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=183.28s)]
*  less likely to pass on your genes than if you think, oh, that must be a saber-toothed [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=190.0s)]
*  tiger. Let's hide from it. Let's run. We have a negativity bias. And I think when Americans [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=195.2s)]
*  hear Donald Trump repeating it, it's not just saying it once. It's saying over and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=201.16s)]
*  over and over. There's something to be afraid of. They're invading our towns. They're occupying [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=206.04s)]
*  our cities. A lot of people think, well, I'm not, I haven't experienced that. That doesn't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  really ring true to me. But isn't it safer to assume maybe he's at least partially right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=216.44s)]
*  And so I think he is really playing on fear. They say logic leads to conclusions, but emotion [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=222.8s)]
*  leads to action. Trump is running this campaign on emotion and on fear, primarily. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=228.14s)]
*  So, Matt, can you just say something there I thought really interesting and something [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=235.0s)]
*  that we've all grappled with throughout the Trump era. He just says things over and over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=238.4s)]
*  and over, often their lies. But yet people start to believe them. And he's good at this, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=241.9s)]
*  at the power of repetition. He says things, their lies. He creates a new story. Other [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=248.04s)]
*  political actors have to respond. The mayor of Aurora, Colorado, the latest example of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=252.44s)]
*  this trying to rebut his false claims about the situation there. And yet in the media [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=256.68s)]
*  covers it. So therefore gives it life. Meanwhile, Vice President Harris, she'll say things over [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=261.28s)]
*  and over again. They get some coverage, but not nearly as much. They don't live on. What [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  are we all as members of the media? How should we be approaching this? There are three weeks [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=270.92s)]
*  to go. This is a dangerous paradigm. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=274.48s)]
*  I don't think we've figured it out yet, Jonathan. And I think this is like the perennial problem [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  in the Trump era is figuring out how do you cover Donald Trump responsibly. I think there's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  certain times when the media fact checks and it backfires. There's the perception, I think, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=292.1s)]
*  going in, and there has been for years, of liberal media bias. And so I think if you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  put your thumb down on the scales, it reinforces that stereotype, which frankly, I think actually [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=303.48s)]
*  had some credence to it throughout a lot of my lifetime, certainly. On the other hand, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  if you let the challenges or the things that Trump says, the allegations, the insinuations, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  the outright lies go unanswered and you don't fact check them, then they become they become [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=318.72s)]
*  fact. And he really uses words to manifest this alternate reality. I don't think we've [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=324.44s)]
*  figured out yet actually how to cover somebody like Donald Trump. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=330.2s)]
*  Really important thoughts. We're grateful for them. This is a storyline we're going [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=335.08s)]
*  to stay on as we focus on the stakes of this election. Author, columnist and conservative [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=338.47999999999996s)]
*  writer Matt Lewis. Matt, thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfNtuW5hKQw&t=342.44s)]
