# House GOP defends Trump amid latest legal woe
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c)
*  Republican lawmakers are jumping to Donald Trump's defense after he [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=0.0s)]
*  announced yesterday that he's the target of a federal probe into efforts to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=4.68s)]
*  overturn the 2020 election. Several members of the House spoke out in favor [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  of Trump yesterday saying the latest move by the Department of Justice is an [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=12.68s)]
*  attempt by President Biden to undermine his top political opponent. Now, none of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=17.84s)]
*  the lawmakers actually addressed Trump's actions surrounding the January 6th [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=22.64s)]
*  insurrection. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=27.28s)]
*  I guess under a Biden administration, by America, you'd expect this. If you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=29.68s)]
*  noticed recently, President Trump went up in the polls and was actually [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=33.92s)]
*  surpassing President Biden for reelection. So what do they do now? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=37.84s)]
*  Weaponized government to go after their number one opponent. It's time and time [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=41.24s)]
*  again. I think the American public is tired of this. They want to have C equal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=46.46s)]
*  justice and the idea that they utilize this to go after those who politically [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=51.24s)]
*  disagree with them is wrong. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  Another example of Joe Biden's weaponized Department of Justice [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=56.36s)]
*  targeting his top political opponent, Donald Trump. Absolute. Yeah, that's my [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=60.36s)]
*  reaction. Um, this is the only way that the Democrats have to beat President [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=66.24s)]
*  Trump is to arrest him, smear him, charge him with ridiculous charges, all [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=70.42s)]
*  in a cover up of Joe Biden's crimes, Hunter Biden's crimes. It's it's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=77.32s)]
*  unbelievable. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=82.0s)]
*  Of course, there's little to no evidence about any of those charges, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=83.88s)]
*  but predictable talking points all the same. Joining us now Congressional [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  investigations reporter for the Washington Post, our friend Jackie [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=91.24s)]
*  Alameda. She is an MSNBC contributor. We're very glad that she's with us [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  this morning. So Jackie, let's talk about that. That is the talking point. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  It has been that way since the Mar-a-Lago documents case and even more [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=101.16s)]
*  so now. Republicans saying this is the DOJ being weaponized to defeat Donald [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=105.72s)]
*  Trump. Um, but talk, walk us through the strategy and the risks to what the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  GOP is doing there. Yeah. And John, we can't forget that Republicans have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=115.08s)]
*  quite a bit of practice even prior to the first indictment when Trump was [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=120.05999999999999s)]
*  indicted earlier this year in New York with regarding hush money payments to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  a porn star. But even going back to his two impeachments, Republicans have [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=129.2s)]
*  gotten down their lines in terms of walking around the actual charges and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=135.74s)]
*  being able to sort of skirt the direct questions while continuing to defend [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=140.72s)]
*  former President Trump. But look, to be clear, Republicans have really [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=145.76s)]
*  organized their entire investigative strategy around defending the former [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=152.36s)]
*  president from the investigations into Hunter Biden, trying to puff up [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=157.68s)]
*  unsubstantiated claims, sort of muddy the waters as much as possible, trying [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  to tie Joe Biden to again unsubstantiated conspiracy theories to then [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=168.2s)]
*  trying to claim that government is weaponized from the Department of Justice [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  to the FBI, to other federal agencies, and that these indictments are simply [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=179.11999999999998s)]
*  the latest example of that. We were we were told really from the beginning to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  look out for Republicans trying to essentially grease the wheels to prepare [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=190.44s)]
*  in advance for these indictments that that they knew were most likely going to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=195.76s)]
*  be coming down the pipeline. So, Jackie, you've been covering the Jack Smith [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=200.2s)]
*  probe so very closely from the beginning. In some ways, what happened yesterday, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=203.88s)]
*  not a surprise, but still historic, still sort of a momentous moment for this [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=208.56s)]
*  nation that a former president likely to face charges here to the very trying to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=212.56s)]
*  disrupt the very fabric of our democracy. So give us give us next steps here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=219.16s)]
*  What are you looking for? Do we anticipate the actual charge could come [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=223.16s)]
*  maybe even next week? How's this going to play out according to your latest [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=226.6s)]
*  reporting? That's a really good question, John. It's something that we were asking [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=229.96s)]
*  and quizzing all of our sources about yesterday. Another big question we were [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=234.88s)]
*  also asking is who else has potentially received a target letter or is Jack [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  going to to sort of go through these indictments piecemeal and stagger them [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=243.08s)]
*  out. But if you look at the numbers with regards to previous indictments that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  have landed with former President Trump, there there was one to two weeks in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=254.76s)]
*  between when the former president received a target letter and when he [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=261.0s)]
*  actually received that indictment, particularly in that Mar-a-Lago documents [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=264.92s)]
*  case where there was around 10 days, I believe it was between between the two. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=269.52s)]
*  We're not sure how much time there's going to be this time around. It really [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  is also sort of dependent on just how firmed up Jack Smith's team of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  prosecutors think they have this case and whether or not the former president [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=286.72s)]
*  agrees to maybe appear before the grand jury or seeks a meeting with Jack [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=290.48s)]
*  Smith himself. We know the last time around the former president did not [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  appear before the grand jury in the Mar-a-Lago documents probe, but that his [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  lawyers did ultimately meet with the special counsel's team. But we are watching [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=302.92s)]
*  it very closely and obviously the shoe could really drop at any moment. And [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=309.32s)]
*  Jackie, we should note that as you were speaking, there's quite the lightning [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=313.56s)]
*  storm in the behind you there. Real quick last question. You know, for the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=315.84s)]
*  documents case, even after charges were brought, Jack Smith still interviewing [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  people. Is there a sense here and again, charges not brought yet, but seem [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=324.0s)]
*  imminent. But the investigation still ongoing. Is Smith still bringing people [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=327.08s)]
*  into talk to? Yes, that is exactly right. Everyone that we've spoken to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=331.42s)]
*  yesterday believes that these air people who either are witnesses or lawyers [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=336.9s)]
*  representing some of these witnesses who are continuing to go before the grand [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=342.74s)]
*  jury. They have said that this investigation appears to be ongoing. And [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=346.86s)]
*  that seems to be in part due to just the huge scope of the investigation. How [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=352.26s)]
*  many people were actually involved in the scheme to overturn the results of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=357.94s)]
*  the election? And again, as I said just a minute ago, there is this feeling [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=361.22s)]
*  that there are going to be others who are going to receive a target letter. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=369.66s)]
*  We have a bit of reporting of other witnesses who have been told that they [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=373.22s)]
*  they are most likely going to receive target letters. It's just a matter of [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=378.18s)]
*  how it's going to be staggered out. Now, once former President Trump is [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=383.14000000000004s)]
*  potentially indicted, which all signs are pointing to that at the moment, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=390.3s)]
*  potentially in the coming day, so much to keep track of congressional [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=394.34s)]
*  investigations reporter for the Washington Post Jackie Alamany. We will [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=397.74s)]
*  speak to you again a little bit later on morning Joe. Thank you for joining us [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  here on way too early and up. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7ug4DaT6c&t=403.82s)]
