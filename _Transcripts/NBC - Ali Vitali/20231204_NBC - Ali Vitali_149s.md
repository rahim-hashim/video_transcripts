# GOP's small House majority risks getting smaller after Santos
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8)
*  Republicans are doing this with a tiny majority there in the House, which you wrote about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=0.0s)]
*  this weekend, noting how it risks getting even smaller now that George Santos has been [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=4.8s)]
*  expelled. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=10.82s)]
*  Yeah, look, House Republicans coming into this session of Congress only had a four-seat [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=11.82s)]
*  majority. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  That is now down to man because George Santos was expelled on Friday, giving them a three-seat [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  majority. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=21.98s)]
*  That majority, Jonathan, believe it or not, could get even smaller. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=22.98s)]
*  Bill Johnson, a Republican in the House, has announced that he's leaving the House by middle [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=26.7s)]
*  of March to take a job as a president at a university. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=32.5s)]
*  And there's swirling speculation regarding will Kevin McCarthy drop out early? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  Of course, we'll remember just recently he was deposed in that embarrassing historic [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  fashion, a lot of folks wondering if he's going to stick it out and remain in Congress. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=45.78s)]
*  I'll note the filing deadline for running for Congress in California is coming up this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=50.46s)]
*  month. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=55.18000000000001s)]
*  Whether or not Kevin McCarthy files for reelection at that date will really tell and give a hint [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=56.3s)]
*  at what his future plans are, both for this Congress and, of course, for the next. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=61.22s)]
*  But nonetheless, this all comes back to these perilous votes that Republicans are heading [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=65.74s)]
*  into, whether it's on opening an impeachment inquiry, whether it's the effort to send aid [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=69.58s)]
*  to Ukraine and Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=73.8s)]
*  House Republicans are now entering these fights with a very slim majority, and the fact of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=75.66s)]
*  the matter is that slim majority can get even narrower. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=79.86s)]
*  Michael Lassley, give us 20 seconds, if you will, any post Santos lessons for the rest [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=87.98s)]
*  I mean, look, this Santos expulsion showed that bipartisanship is possible because there [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=88.98s)]
*  were both Republicans and Democrats who came together, but it also shows that there won't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=95.86s)]
*  be this toleration of behavior like Santos. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=100.66s)]
*  And this was something that was a long time coming. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=104.66s)]
*  Santos had come under controversy since even before he was sworn into Congress. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=107.3s)]
*  I think a lot of people expected that it may end this way. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=111.22s)]
*  Santos told me last week that he didn't. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=113.62s)]
*  But nonetheless, this shows that partisanship is still high in the House, but bipartisanship [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=115.94s)]
*  is also possible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=120.18s)]
*  Another lesson, don't lie about your college volleyball career and thousands of other things. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=121.18s)]
*  Congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael Schnell, thank you so much. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=126.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Myby9f9IK8&t=141.14s)]
