# 'It's up to Republicans': House Democrat on shutdown possibility
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74)
*  Welcome back to way too early on a busy Thursday morning. Congress appears no [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=0.0s)]
*  closer to a solution to fund the government with less than three days to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=5.2s)]
*  go until a shutdown begins. House Republicans yesterday squashed the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=9.16s)]
*  bipartisan funding plan from the Senate with hardline conservatives criticizing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=14.06s)]
*  it for having aid for Ukraine. Meanwhile the House GOP is pushing forward with a [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=19.32s)]
*  plan to appease hardline conservatives with steeper spending cuts which is [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  likely to fail in the Democratic-led Senate even if it were to somehow pass [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=29.34s)]
*  the House. This all comes as Republicans in both chambers are playing the blame [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=33.5s)]
*  game despite beginning this process with the deal already in place between House [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=39.18s)]
*  Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Biden on how to fund the government. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=44.58s)]
*  The House is working on passing 73% of all the appropriation bills of the job [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=50.82s)]
*  we're supposed to do by Thursday. We're bringing up on Friday ability to fund [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=55.66s)]
*  the government but at the same time secure our border. So yes we're doing our [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=60.5s)]
*  job. So what does the president have to do with that? If he wants to sit and hide [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  in the White House and put the government into a shutdown that's on him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=68.34s)]
*  You have 6.2 billion for Ukraine. They do nothing to secure our southern border. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=73.66s)]
*  That is just a non-starter. The Senate needs to get real. You've all seen the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=80.22s)]
*  images of the southern border. It has to stop immediately and this government [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=84.46s)]
*  should not continue to be funding funded if we don't secure our border. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  This is a huge mess and here we are at midnight the night before an exam and we [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=93.17999999999999s)]
*  just started to study and there was really no need for this to happen the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=98.86s)]
*  way that it went down and I've been frustrated by the process. I thought we [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=102.82s)]
*  would be better than this and here we are scrambling and no one knows what's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=107.06s)]
*  next. Mr. President a vote against a standard short-term funding measure is a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=110.86s)]
*  vote against paying over a billion dollars in salary for Border Patrol and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=118.06s)]
*  ICE agents working to track down lethal fentanyl and tame our open borders. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=124.62s)]
*  Joining us now Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of the Commonwealth of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=132.62s)]
*  Massachusetts. He serves on the Armed Services Committee and is a combat [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=137.66s)]
*  veteran who served four tours for the US Marines. Thank you Congressman for being [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=141.42s)]
*  here this morning. So let's talk about the possibility for this shutdown. There's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=145.18s)]
*  new polling that suggests that Americans would basically blame everyone. 32% say [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  that everyone is blamed equally and then you have another 29% say it's a GOP, 14 [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=154.06s)]
*  Democrats. But as many have noted there was a deal already struck between [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=158.62s)]
*  McCarthy, the speaker and President Biden a few months ago and now it seems [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=163.94s)]
*  like the GOP has gotten cold feet. What's your assessment of where things stand and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=167.98s)]
*  is there any way that the government's not shutting down in a few days? Well [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=171.1s)]
*  look it really is up to Republicans and it's up to Republicans in the House [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=175.46s)]
*  because in the Senate Democrats and Republicans came together 77 to 19 so a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=179.18s)]
*  lot of Republicans and Democrats the overwhelming majority of the Senate [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=184.98s)]
*  voting to fund the government they're sending that bill over to the House all [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=188.74s)]
*  we need to do is under Speaker McCarthy take up that bill and have a bipartisan [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=193.38s)]
*  vote on getting it passed and you would see a lot of Republicans and a lot of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=198.5s)]
*  Democrats in the House doing exactly what happened in the Senate and averting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=202.78s)]
*  the shutdown. The issue is in fighting in the Republican Party the people who [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=206.3s)]
*  won't even let Speaker McCarthy take this bill up for a vote because they say [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=211.54s)]
*  he'll lose his job. So this is completely bickering among Republicans and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=216.42000000000002s)]
*  unfortunately for those of us Democrats who want to do the right thing who want [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=221.38s)]
*  to join with Republicans to make sure our government gets funded there's not [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=225.3s)]
*  much we can do if Speaker McCarthy won't even put that bill on the floor. So what [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=229.1s)]
*  do you make Congressman of where things stand with funding to Ukraine? There [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=233.46s)]
*  are support in the Senate about two-thirds of the House yesterday voted [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=238.18s)]
*  to have it in but they are of course very loud voices in the GOP opposing any [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=242.9s)]
*  and all. How concerned are you about where that stands? Look I think it's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=248.66s)]
*  concerning because funding Ukraine is incredibly important to our national [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=253.66s)]
*  security. I mean when I sit on the select committee on China and when we [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=258.38s)]
*  look at deterring war in the Pacific at sending a message to China that they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=262.74s)]
*  should not start a war over Taiwan the number one issue is how we respond to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=266.94s)]
*  Ukraine. So investing in Ukraine now is an investment in our national security [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  now and into the future and the reality is that most Republicans behind closed [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=277.1s)]
*  doors know this. As you pointed out even when faced with a public vote last night [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=282.34000000000003s)]
*  there were two amendments to strip Ukraine funding out of the bill and an [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=287.14000000000004s)]
*  overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans voted to keep it in to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=291.82000000000005s)]
*  support Ukraine funding. I sit on the House Armed Services Committee when we [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=296.62s)]
*  have behind closed doors briefings we have classified briefings the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  Republicans are almost unanimously supportive of Ukraine but then they get [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=304.26s)]
*  out on TV the next moment and say something different then they play to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=308.46s)]
*  their base just like just like Kevin McCarthy is subservient to this extreme [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=312.26s)]
*  dangerous wing of the Republican Party that's against Ukraine and that's why we [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=317.02s)]
*  have this quandary it's not because they don't believe in it it's because they [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=322.06s)]
*  don't have the political courage to say it. And congressman lastly and briefly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  please the impeachment inquiry process into President Biden's beginning today [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=329.06s)]
*  in the House there seems to be no evidence yet of any wrongdoing. Where do [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=332.98s)]
*  you expect to happen today what's the pushback? I mean when you see Ken Buck [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  who's one of the most conservative Republicans I know writing in the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=341.58000000000004s)]
*  Washington Post that this impeachment inquiry is completely bogus there's no [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=344.74s)]
*  evidence to support it I mean they're obviously just playing politics and they [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=349.86s)]
*  can't even get the government funded in the process. All right Democratic [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=354.02000000000004s)]
*  Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts thank you so much for being here this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=357.98s)]
*  morning we'll help you come back soon. Take care. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUcTy2iJ74&t=361.02s)]
