# Rep. Scalise withdraws from speaker race
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ)
*  The GOP battle for a new House Speaker has descended into even further disarray this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans disarray. Just one day after Republicans nominated Majority Leader Steve [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=6.88s)]
*  Scalise for the position, the Louisiana Congressman withdrew from the race last night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=11.76s)]
*  I just shared with my colleagues that I'm withdrawing my name as a candidate for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=19.12s)]
*  the Speaker-designee. If you look at over the last few weeks, if you look at where our conference is, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=22.64s)]
*  there's still work to be done. Our conference still has to come together and is not there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=30.96s)]
*  Scalise simply didn't have the support. Now, two top Republicans are calling for dramatic action [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=39.28s)]
*  to overcome the Speaker's standoff. Bloomberg reports that Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  has suggested that Republicans might have to cut a deal with Democrats and called on House Minority [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=50.56s)]
*  Leader Hakeem Jeffries to spell out what concessions he would require to help the GOP select a Speaker. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=56.56s)]
*  At the same time, Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul said the House might need to grant [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  legislative powers to the interim Speaker, that's Patrick McHenry, so the chamber can act on a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=68.56s)]
*  national security package for Israel. But even doing that would also require Democratic support. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  And we need to fill the chair with a Speaker. Every day that goes by, it gets more dangerous. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=81.52s)]
*  You know, I was on the phone with our friends from Israel. They're going to need a supplemental, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=88.08s)]
*  an aid to replenish the Iron Dome. But they can't do that if we don't have a Speaker in the chair. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=92.0s)]
*  So I see a lot of threats out there, but one of the biggest threats I see is in that room. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=97.44s)]
*  It's very dangerous what we're doing. And I just wanted them to know that, you know, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=101.28s)]
*  we're playing with fire. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=107.04s)]
*  Congressman McCaul, not the only Republican lawmaker to express frustration that the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=108.0s)]
*  House Speaker race is taking away from precious time that could be spent addressing the Israel-Hamas [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=113.52s)]
*  war. Meanwhile, House Republicans will be at it again later this morning. They plan to meet at 10 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=118.88s)]
*  o'clock as they try to plot the next steps forward. Joining us now, Capitol Hill reporter for The [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, Siobhan Hughes. Siobhan, great to see you this morning. So first, let's start [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=130.56s)]
*  with Scalise. Take us inside that meeting last night and give us a rundown, what your sources [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=135.12s)]
*  are telling you as to why Scalise simply and ultimately had to withdraw from the race. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=139.6s)]
*  Scalise had to withdraw from the race because he simply could not bring those Jordan supporters [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=146.24s)]
*  along. Among the criticisms of him, he did not spell out a specific plan for things like how you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=150.96s)]
*  get past a government shutdown. Also, these worries, whether real or an excuse about his health, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=156.96s)]
*  whether or not the blood cancer he's battling would enable him to be a strong fundraiser. And [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=164.8s)]
*  of course, President Trump's appearance on a radio program yesterday only exacerbating those claims. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  Finally, the complaint that Scalise is too much a problem of the traditional establishment in spite [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=175.12s)]
*  of his conservative bona fides. He just wasn't seen by the hard right as being enough of a fighter. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  So what's next? Jim Jordan, as you just mentioned him, he was second place last time around. Is there [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=187.28s)]
*  any scenario where he could try to garner more support to get to that magic 217? Is there a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=193.2s)]
*  potential new candidate, more of a mainstream consensus candidate who could step forward? What's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  your read of the field? So the expectation is that Jim Jordan and his supporters are going to make a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=204.48s)]
*  strong bid for the speakership today, but it's expected that he is not going to be able to amass [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  those 217 votes. And in part, that is because he and his supporters in particular have really [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=217.44s)]
*  poisoned the well by resorting to what their critics see as these guerrilla tactics of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=224.0s)]
*  essentially crowbarring their way into the speaker's office and then trying to take the place over. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=229.6s)]
*  Some other names that are floating in the mix are Kevin Hearn, the chairman of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=234.56s)]
*  influential Republican study committee. Also names like Tom Emmer. Kevin McCarthy is in the mix. You [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=239.84s)]
*  saw Tom McClintock, a California Republican say yesterday he thought Kevin McCarthy should be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=246.8s)]
*  restored. There was also in the room last night some conversation about trying to revive prospects [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  for Steve Scalise. And then of course, what you just mentioned earlier, this idea that was once [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=258.24s)]
*  more of a fantasy or a fairy tale that perhaps Democrats could come to the rescue. And one [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=264.16s)]
*  scenario is that Democrats could help provide the votes to make the acting current speaker, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=271.12s)]
*  Patrick McHenry, sort of a caretaker, somebody who would be able to at least bring legislation [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=277.36s)]
*  to the floor at a time when of course we are looking at the potential for a government shutdown [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=282.88s)]
*  in mid-November. So let's talk a little bit more about that idea that the Democrats could [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=287.44s)]
*  bail out the Republicans. What would they, and you did a nice job laying out the stakes here, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=292.16s)]
*  there's government shutdown looming. We just mentioned of course the need to send Israel a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=296.32s)]
*  security package. But if the Democrats are going to bail out the Republicans, what do you think [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=299.76s)]
*  they would get in return? Would any Democrats be open to this? Well, what we know is what Democrats [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=303.92s)]
*  have previously discussed they would need. It would be, they say, some type of a power sharing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=309.36s)]
*  arrangement, perhaps commitments to bring legislation to the floor, perhaps chairmanships. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=314.64s)]
*  But that is the scenario in which Democrats provide the votes for a permanent speaker. There's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=321.44s)]
*  also another narrower scenario in which Democrats simply provide the votes to make Patrick McHenry [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=327.76s)]
*  a caretaker speaker for a limited amount of time, maybe with limits on what type of legislation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=334.88s)]
*  he's able to bring to the floor. So there is no clear-cut outcome here, but there are a lot of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=341.92s)]
*  ideas in play. All right, we know at least some Republicans meet again today, but it seems likely [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  this will spill into next week or beyond. The clock is ticking. Capitol Hill reporter for the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=351.36s)]
*  Wall Street Journal, Siobhan Hughes. Great stuff this morning. Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gk8FCqHbqQ&t=355.36s)]
