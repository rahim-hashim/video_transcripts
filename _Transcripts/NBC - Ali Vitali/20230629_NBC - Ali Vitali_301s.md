# GOP candidates embrace border wall despite past criticism
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU)
*  Almost every Republican presidential candidate is pushing to build a wall along the southern border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=0.0s)]
*  You'll recall that was one of Donald Trump's signature campaign promises. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=6.4s)]
*  He ran on that idea of building a wall back in 2016. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=10.16s)]
*  At the time he was met with criticism from a whole bunch of Republicans, some of whom are now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  That includes Chris Christie and Nikki Haley, who both appear to have had a change of heart. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=19.64s)]
*  In 2015, Haley called the build the wall slogan a quote, gimmick. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=24.92s)]
*  Two months ago, she toured the border where parts of the wall have been put up and promised to quote, finish what we started. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=29.88s)]
*  So let's talk to national political correspondent for Axios, Alex Thompson, who's got some brand new reporting on this very issue. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=36.28s)]
*  So we should note that there actually hasn't been that much of the wall that's been built under Trump's administration, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=43.32s)]
*  although he claims all the time that it's big and beautiful and finished. That's not true. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=48.8s)]
*  That said, a lot of Republicans now, as you report smartly, have really embraced this concept. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=53.64s)]
*  Tell us what that means about how simply how the party has changed since 2016. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=58.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you we've always talked about in 2012, there was the big GOP autopsy, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=62.36s)]
*  Which is you have to become more lenient on illegal immigration. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=67.72s)]
*  You have to embrace immigration reform. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=70.84s)]
*  Donald Trump defied that, ended up winning. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=73.32s)]
*  Now you have the entire party basically circling around what Trump did on immigration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=75.56s)]
*  In some cases, they're actually they're actually pushing to go even beyond what Trump did and criticizing Donald Trump [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=81.52s)]
*  for not being tough enough on immigration or not being effective enough. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=88.04s)]
*  You had Ronald, you had Ron DeSantis down at the border on Monday. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  He was speaking in front of huge banners that said finish the wall, build the wall. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  You also have Vivek Ramaswamy basically saying Trump didn't do enough. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  We have to bring the army to the border. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  You essentially have to militarize the entire southern border. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=105.76s)]
*  This is where the rhetoric has gone. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  In fact, people are and it's basically a bet that the GOP electorate is more angry than they were in 2016 rather than less. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=111.0s)]
*  So let's take this from another angle. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=118.16s)]
*  It shows that's a specific policy proposal that clearly shows where the Republicans party stands on immigration. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  But it also shows just Donald Trump's complete dominance of the field. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  This is his signature issue. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=128.28s)]
*  And if you're a candidate who's trying to beat Donald Trump, you eventually have to differentiate yourself from Donald Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=129.76s)]
*  They're not doing it here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=134.32s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=135.6s)]
*  The only way they're differentiating is saying, well, he was right on the substance. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=136.88s)]
*  But wrong on the execution. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=140.76s)]
*  And it's really unclear if you can run against Donald Trump and as the tribute band, essentially Donald Trump, when people still want to see the original show. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=142.72s)]
*  They still want to see the stones, not the not the tribute band. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=151.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  And like it's it's it's the Republicans have just had so much trouble figuring out how to approach Trump, you know, because they don't want to alienate his base. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=155.6s)]
*  But also like they're worse coming off as a pale imitation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  I want to revisit something we talked about earlier in the show, which is President Biden really embracing the state of the economy right now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=166.56s)]
*  And look, the economy is central to any incumbent running for reelection. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=173.4s)]
*  The economy goes south. It could be bad news for the hopes of a second term. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=176.88s)]
*  White House staff pretty candid. They feel like they're not getting enough credit for this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  They're really trying to do a sales job. They were in Chicago yesterday with a binomic speech. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=184.36s)]
*  He's talking about it again later this week, too. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=188.84s)]
*  Tell me what you think's behind it and what risks are there? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=191.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, essentially, even though they have a really there's a lot of things that they can point to that point to a very strong economic record, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=194.84s)]
*  you know, record record levels of low unemployment, et cetera. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=204.0s)]
*  But if you look at the polling, actually, there isn't a lot to be very encouraged about if you were in the White House right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  For instance, Gallup always tracks confidence or feelings about the economy when when sorry, when Joe Biden was sworn in, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=213.36s)]
*  only about 33 percent rated the economy as poor. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=221.92s)]
*  Remember, this is still before the vaccines. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=225.16s)]
*  Just recently, as of last month, 47 percent rated the economy as poor. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=228.0s)]
*  So you have this sort of risk where they do have something to run on and they do feel that they don't get enough credit for things that go right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=232.92s)]
*  For instance, bringing gas prices down if they were high. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=239.6s)]
*  But if you embrace the economy and people don't feel good about it, then you really run a huge risk of not having a good reelection. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=242.84s)]
*  And it's that poll number is so stunning that more Americans, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=251.2s)]
*  typically more Americans feel worse about the economy now than then, even by virtually every metric. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=254.48s)]
*  It's doing better. Yep. Inflation remains high, of course, but certainly better than it was as well. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  And we should note President Biden sits down with our colleague, Nicole Wallace, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=263.04s)]
*  for an exclusive live interview today at four o'clock on Deadline White House. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=266.56s)]
*  I believe his first live televised interview since taking office. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=270.12s)]
*  National political correspondent for Axios. Great stuff as always. Alex Thompson. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  We really appreciate it. Thank you for being here. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=277.28s)]
*  And thanks to all of you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyViLyxn6wU&t=279.6s)]
