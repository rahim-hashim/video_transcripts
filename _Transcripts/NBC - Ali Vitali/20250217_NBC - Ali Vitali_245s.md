# Banks, post offices, government offices, stock market closed for Presidents Day
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U)
*  Many workers and students are enjoying the day off today for Presidents Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=0.0s)]
*  Of course, no breaks here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=5.12s)]
*  Banks, post offices, government offices, public schools, and the stock market will all be [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  closed in honor of the holiday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=11.22s)]
*  But not everyone has the day off. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=13.08s)]
*  Grocery stores, retail stores, and restaurants will be the most part, will for the most part [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=14.72s)]
*  be open. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=19.2s)]
*  Joining us now for more on why we celebrate Presidents Day, presidential historian and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=20.2s)]
*  executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library, Lindsay Churwinski. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=24.6s)]
*  Alright, so the headline here is presidential historian says Presidents Day is ridiculous, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=29.2s)]
*  we should scrap it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  It is a little bit silly. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we have had some real duds, so I'm not sure we really want to be celebrating [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=36.84s)]
*  all presidents. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=40.48s)]
*  And the tradition actually comes from celebrating birthdays, which is a celebration that we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=42.04s)]
*  inherited from celebrating the king. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=47.56s)]
*  And I'm just not sure that that's exactly what we want. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=49.96s)]
*  I think instead it makes a lot more sense to celebrate actions. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=52.36s)]
*  Let's celebrate Washington returning his command and ensuring that there wasn't a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=56.4s)]
*  military dictatorship. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=59.64s)]
*  Let's celebrate Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, things that they actually had control over [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=61.08s)]
*  as opposed to their birthday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=66.64s)]
*  I think a lot of people were taught in school, okay, it's Presidents Day, we're just celebrating [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=67.64s)]
*  the fact that we've had all of these various presidents. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=71.36s)]
*  That's of course not the case now, what you're saying. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=74.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I just, I'm not sure that we necessarily want to celebrate the people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=76.6s)]
*  I think that we want to have a certain respect for the office. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=80.68s)]
*  I totally get that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=83.92s)]
*  And some have done extraordinary things, but by celebrating all of them, I do think it [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=85.36s)]
*  causes us to think of the president as somehow other when in reality they are a citizen just [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  like everyone else. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=95.88s)]
*  So you're saying almost normalize the presidency. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=96.88s)]
*  Normalize the presidency and then celebrate extraordinary service. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=100.28s)]
*  So when someone does something above and beyond, and there have been amazing examples of that, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=104.08s)]
*  let's celebrate those moments. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=109.28s)]
*  What's the outgrowth of normalizing the presidency? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=110.68s)]
*  Because obviously I've done presidential campaigns now for the last three cycles and I do notice [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=113.16s)]
*  that there is a star power that's required if you're going to win a nomination and then [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=118.0s)]
*  of course be elected to the White House. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  That star power is the catapulting force behind a lot of these candidates, but clearly you're [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  saying that's not what we should be venerating in these officials. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  Well I think it's worth acknowledging like really excellent skills. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  It's worth respecting those things. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=138.04s)]
*  But I think that if we see them as somehow other, it causes us to believe that we shouldn't [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=140.16s)]
*  criticize, we shouldn't analyze, we shouldn't hold accountable, and there are a lot of conversations [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=144.88s)]
*  now about how much power should the president actually have. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=149.96s)]
*  And if we're treating them as these objects of veneration, it's a lot harder to say no [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=153.76s)]
*  we should actually check that power. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=158.26s)]
*  Well we talked about this earlier in the show, right? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=159.8s)]
*  And I love when you come on to talk about presidential history because it's not just [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=161.76s)]
*  history that you're reading in a book, you're regularly tying it to what's happening right [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=165.04s)]
*  now. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=168.84s)]
*  And you mentioned this earlier in the show, the idea that Trump posted something just [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  over the weekend where he quoted Napoleon Bonaparte-esque saying, he who saves his country [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=172.88s)]
*  does not violate any law. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=178.38s)]
*  Feels like exactly the example of what you're saying we should push against. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=180.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=183.88s)]
*  I mean I think if we think of a president as someone to celebrate just because they exist, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=185.44s)]
*  which is what the king was and that's why they celebrated the king's birthday, then [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=190.28s)]
*  you kind of, it does evolve into that argument that they can do no wrong. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  So then your main message here for anyone who, even if they're off, is still tuning [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  in, what would you tell them President's Day in their mind should be reframed as? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=203.0s)]
*  Think about the things that are really worth celebrating. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=208.12s)]
*  Think about the actions and the leadership that we want presidents to embody and celebrate [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=210.76s)]
*  that instead. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=216.88s)]
*  Dr. Lindsay Churwinski, coming through with the history that is very, very much current. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=217.88s)]
*  I appreciate you joining us as always, my friend. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYHqZ74j5U&t=224.44s)]
