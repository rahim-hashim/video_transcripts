# House to vote to send Biden impeachment to committees
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8)
*  House Republicans will vote to send a resolution to impeach President Biden to the Homeland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=0.0s)]
*  Security and Judiciary Committees. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  The resolution charges Biden with high crimes and misdemeanors over his handling of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=8.92s)]
*  southern border. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=13.32s)]
*  It was introduced by Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=14.9s)]
*  She had wanted to hold an immediate... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=18.48s)]
*  But Speaker Kevin McCarthy urged her to go through the committees that are investigating [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=21.0s)]
*  the president. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=24.88s)]
*  Speaking to reporters yesterday, he compared Republican efforts to impeach Biden to Democrats [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=26.08s)]
*  who he said rushed to impeach Donald Trump. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=30.92s)]
*  ...important things members of Congress has a right to do and to take it in a flippant [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=56.0s)]
*  way to just put something privileged on the floor like that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=62.32s)]
*  We're going to censure Adam's shift for taking us through impeachment and lying to the American [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=64.64s)]
*  public and we don't want to turn around the next day and do this... [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=69.88s)]
*  Joining us now, communications strategist and former aide to House speakers Ryan and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=74.2s)]
*  Boehner, Brandon Buck. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=78.76s)]
*  He is an MSNBC political analyst and familiar with the doings of the Republicans in the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=80.08s)]
*  House. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's just start right there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=85.96s)]
*  Are they going to impeach President Biden? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=86.96s)]
*  It certainly feels like it at some point or at least they'll have that vote at some point. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  This is... [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=94.32s)]
*  I feel for Kevin McCarthy there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  A not insignificant part of the job of being Republican speaker is stopping your members [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=97.72s)]
*  from doing something politically dumb. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=102.63999999999999s)]
*  And that's clearly what's going on here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  But the reality is the House members are losing patience with a lot of these investigations [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=108.6s)]
*  And that's because they rushed out right after the election and said that pretty plainly [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=113.4s)]
*  that Joe Biden is part of some corruption deal with his son. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=119.0s)]
*  In fact, Jim Jordan and James Comer, those two party chairman came out and said they [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=124.12s)]
*  have direct evidence that Joe Biden was a part of some schemes with overseas dealings. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=128.12s)]
*  And of course, six months later, we've not seen any of that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=134.68s)]
*  And so at some point, your members get tired, they lose patience and they want to see some [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=137.66s)]
*  And that's what came to head with Lauren Boebert. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  For now, Kevin McCarthy has put that to bed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=144.04s)]
*  But I would be very surprised if that does not bring itself back up at some point in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  the not too distant future. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=150.56s)]
*  See you use the phrase politically dumb. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=152.2s)]
*  I think that's appropriate here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=154.0s)]
*  So let's say they go through with this in the weeks or months ahead. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=156.33999999999997s)]
*  How do you see that playing out, you know, yet within the Republican base, but also with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=159.48s)]
*  a general electorate as we head to 2024? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=164.72s)]
*  The thing that Joe Biden has going for him, probably more than anything, is a House Republican [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=169.0s)]
*  conference that he can contrast with that simply can't stop themselves from overreaching. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=173.64s)]
*  It's not a novel concept. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=180.27999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Barack Obama used a contrast with House Republicans to get himself reelected. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=182.2s)]
*  Bill Clinton contrasted himself with Newt Gingrich to get himself reelected. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  If Joe Biden takes advantage here, he can absolutely score some some political points [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=191.76s)]
*  because House Republicans tend to look unserious when they do things like this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  Look at Adam Schiff just censured on the floor is raising all kinds of money, taking advantage [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=202.18s)]
*  of the fact that House Republicans are targeting in him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=207.78s)]
*  So yeah, this is a could be a big gift to Joe Biden, but it's a pretty serious thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=210.54s)]
*  As Kevin McCarthy said there, the impeachment power is enormous. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=214.54s)]
*  And for it to become trivialized and just a thing that every Congress does to the opposing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=219.06s)]
*  president, I think would be really damaging. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=223.5s)]
*  But at the same time, big upside for Joe Biden. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I completely agree. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  It should be historic and rare. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=229.78s)]
*  We know the only handful of times when used, it would be bad for the country if it became [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=231.42s)]
*  just a thing that happened. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=235.14s)]
*  So Brennan, as president who was impeached twice as Donald Trump, he's obviously in a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=236.98s)]
*  lot of legal hot water right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=241.5s)]
*  We saw a poll yesterday that showed his support has slipped a little among Republicans in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  the wake of his federal arraignment. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=248.06s)]
*  He's still far and away the front runner, but a little bit of a drop, six or so points. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  What's your read on that? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=254.18s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to see some more data before coming to conclusion that he is actually slipping [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=255.74s)]
*  too much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=260.3s)]
*  I think it's important to appreciate he still has an enormous lead in that poll. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=261.3s)]
*  It is not as though he is cratered by any means. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=264.3s)]
*  And we've seen lots of polls that have shown his support remaining strong. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=266.62s)]
*  I think the takeaway here is perhaps there is an opening, but his fellow competitors [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=271.22s)]
*  for the nomination need to take advantage of it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=276.02s)]
*  Just letting him sit there and defend himself and defending him, frankly, is not going to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=279.18s)]
*  do anything to hurt his poll number. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=284.82s)]
*  So if there's an opening, I think some of his fellow campaigners should take it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=286.9s)]
*  But I'd like to see a little more hard data before I conclude that he's actually in any [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=293.14s)]
*  real trouble. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=296.82s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=297.82s)]
*  It is just one poll. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=298.82s)]
*  We should note, though, in that poll, Haley and Pence up a little, but Ron DeSantis stayed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=299.82s)]
*  flat, still 30 odd points behind Trump. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=304.74s)]
*  Brennan Buck, thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=307.74s)]
*  As always, great to talk to you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=308.86s)]
*  We will again soon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0H7KI0z1x8&t=309.86s)]
