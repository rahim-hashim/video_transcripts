# Congresswoman Reflects On New Security Camera Footage | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 11, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc)
*  Lord, during this impeachment trial, give our lawmakers the gift of discernment so that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=0.0s)]
*  they will know truth from falsehood. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=10.24s)]
*  That was U.S. Senate Chaplain Barry Black offering up a word of prayer ahead of yesterday's impeachment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=16.98s)]
*  proceedings. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now is Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  She served as a CIA case officer before running for Congress and was also inside the House [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=27.68s)]
*  chamber on the day of the January 6th attack. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=32.48s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for getting up early with us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  I was just hoping to start with your reflections as you watched, along with all of us, the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=38.72s)]
*  new video, the new pieces of evidence that were laid out in this trial and how you think [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=44.8s)]
*  it may or may not impact your Senate colleagues. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=50.44s)]
*  Seeing the evidence that was presented was a pretty interesting experience because I [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=56.24s)]
*  had lived so much of it in the firsthand way. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=60.88s)]
*  So as they were piecing together the timeline, I think that was the most extraordinary part [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  of it all for me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=71.64s)]
*  I had been in the chamber when the speaker was evacuated out. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=72.64s)]
*  I had been in the House chamber when they told us to put on our gas masks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  I had been there when we started slamming doors shut and locking them down. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=80.72s)]
*  I was there when they evacuated out the folks who were on the floor and those of us in the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=85.36s)]
*  gallery still were trying to figure out how we would get out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=89.64s)]
*  We were there when there was screaming, there was yelling. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=93.68s)]
*  The police officers were barricading up the doors with tables and benches when the gunshot [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  went off. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  And I was there when colleagues were praying and crying and people were calling family [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  members. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  And so to watch that timeline really come together was pretty extraordinary. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  And some of the videos that were played throughout the trial, I think gave a clear perception [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=113.56s)]
*  to the American people just how terrible that day was. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=124.84s)]
*  And I think what's most notable for me, when we were in the House gallery, that was the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=128.88s)]
*  same time we were still there when the men with flexicuffs were in the Senate gallery. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=134.88s)]
*  So just even thinking about the fact that why, as a former federal agent, in addition [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=141.24s)]
*  to being a former CIA officer, we had flexicuffs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  You have flexicuffs to detain people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=148.38s)]
*  And so the idea that they were there in the Senate, they had already broken into the Senate [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=152.0s)]
*  when we were still unable to evacuate out of the House. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  If they had come in the other door, would they have come in the gallery? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  And they didn't get to us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=164.44s)]
*  And they didn't get to us because there were lines of Capitol police officers and later [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=165.44s)]
*  Metropolitan police officers who fought to keep people safe and save lives. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=169.6s)]
*  And they did. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=175.88s)]
*  They sure did. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=178.88s)]
*  And Congresswoman, I'm glad you pointed out that you are also a federal agent. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=180.4s)]
*  You've been in these situations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=185.88s)]
*  You understand how law enforcement officials will operate in some of these kinds of cases. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=188.08s)]
*  You understand how investigations proceed. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  The thing that we're looking at in this trial, of course, is what's the connection between [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=196.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's words and actions and what happened to you and all of your colleagues [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=200.72s)]
*  on January 6th? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=205.56s)]
*  What do you think are the most important pieces of that puzzle right now? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=207.64s)]
*  I think that the impeachment managers have really laid out a clear timeframe, right, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=213.32s)]
*  where we see an individual, the president of the United States, who continues to perpetuate [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=221.32s)]
*  a lie, a lie that an election was stolen, a lie that people needed to stand up and stop [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=229.28s)]
*  the steal, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=236.48s)]
*  A stealing is an aggressive criminal act. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=237.48s)]
*  And so he was calling to people to stop that steal. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=241.72s)]
*  He was promising people that January 6th would be wild. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=245.28s)]
*  He was compelling people to stand up and fight or you won't have a country left. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=249.28s)]
*  And when you juxtapose those words with the actions of people responding to them and the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=253.88s)]
*  video of people on megaphones reading his tweets as though he was communicating with [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=260.04s)]
*  them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  They seemed so organized. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  The videos, the ways, there's a couple videos where you can see that people were kind of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  scouting out doors and there's some where people run, they see that a door might be [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  more vulnerable. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=281.08s)]
*  Many of the doors are heavy wooden doors. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=282.72s)]
*  Some of them are just glass. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=285.2s)]
*  And there's the surveillance videos where people are motioning, come to this door. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=286.64s)]
*  Clearly they were trying to permeate throughout the Capitol, find, they were screaming, hang [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=292.44s)]
*  Mike Pence. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  They were beating police officers. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  And so when you look at the timeline, it's just horrific. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=303.44s)]
*  And then coupling that with when he had the chance to say, stop, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=307.67999999999995s)]
*  Stop, stop this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=313.2s)]
*  He didn't and he didn't and he didn't and he didn't. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  And that to me is just the most horrifying, horrifying reality of this all. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=319.32s)]
*  For hours. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, I also just want to take a minute to note you were with [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  my colleague, Haley Talbot, in that gallery and you took personal responsibility to look [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  out for her safety. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=340.0s)]
*  And we are just incredibly grateful that you did that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  And I really appreciate you being up here this morning with us and sharing what was [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  a very emotional and difficult day. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=348.36s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=350.04s)]
*  Casey, if I can say thank you, it's because of reporters and journalists like Haley and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=351.04s)]
*  so many of your colleagues in media that we have a really clear understanding and incredibly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=356.04s)]
*  moving photos and a really incredible timeline because during all of that horror, they continue [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=361.88s)]
*  to do the job. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=370.36s)]
*  Thank you, Congresswoman. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=371.36s)]
*  Today. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDqaGv3SDkc&t=386.04s)]
