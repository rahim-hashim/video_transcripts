# Can Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s appeal help Democrats expand their reach in 2026?
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g)
*  Freshman Senator Alyssa Slotkin of Michigan will deliver the Democratic response to Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=0.0s)]
*  joint address to Congress on Tuesday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=5.24s)]
*  Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, was able to pull off a win in Michigan while former Vice [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=7.68s)]
*  President Kamala Harris lost the state by roughly 80,000 votes. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Congressman Adriano Espaillat will deliver the Spanish-language response for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=16.52s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=21.36s)]
*  Espaillat currently chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and is the first Dominican [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=22.36s)]
*  American and first formerly undocumented immigrant to serve in Congress. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=26.34s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional reporter for Punchbowl News Max Cohen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=30.58s)]
*  Max, first, what do you make of the Slotkin choice? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=34.019999999999996s)]
*  Notoriously, the response on either side of the political aisle is kind of a thankless [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=36.3s)]
*  position. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=41.42s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=42.42s)]
*  I mean, listen, that shows exactly where Democrats want to go, which is looking at how the party [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=43.42s)]
*  can come out of the political wilderness. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=47.5s)]
*  Slotkin won in Michigan, as you mentioned, while Trump won. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  And many in the base are saying, how can we win back these seats? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=53.5s)]
*  What message works to win over Trump voters, even in states where Democrats have struggled? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=57.5s)]
*  So she'll give an economic message, we believe, to say, look, Democrats need to return to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=62.2s)]
*  their roots as a working class party and also build bridges, a bipartisan message, as Republicans [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=66.18s)]
*  control all of Washington, how they can assert their power. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=72.14s)]
*  Yeah, Slotkin, one of those fascinating circumstances, but also the same with Gallego, with Cortez [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=74.7s)]
*  Masto out in Nevada, Gallego, of course, in Arizona, where they managed to win their Senate [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=79.18s)]
*  races. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=84.14s)]
*  But Trump, of course, took their state overall in the presidential. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=85.14s)]
*  Is that something that's informing how the party is thinking about its rising stars? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  Or is it also people like Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy, who have been very vocal and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=92.18s)]
*  to varying degrees successfully so in this Trump environment? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's an incredible mix happening right now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  Some in the base want their party leaders to be as aggressive as possible in combating [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=103.76s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=109.3s)]
*  And I think that's kind of the Murphy-Schatz angle you just mentioned. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=110.3s)]
*  But also some more pragmatic voters say, hey, look, we love the resistance vibe, but we [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=112.78s)]
*  also want someone who has a proven track record of winning tough elections. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  So is that kind of push and pull, which is leading to this Democratic confusion right [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=121.3s)]
*  now as the progressive base and maybe the more pragmatic base want a couple of different [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=124.66s)]
*  things? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=129.86s)]
*  I know you and I were talking while we were off camera about the town hall that I was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=130.86s)]
*  at last night, and I was talking to Alencia Johnson about this, the Democratic strategist [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=133.46s)]
*  who was just on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=136.78s)]
*  There is palpable frustration from Democrats that they're not doing enough. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=137.78s)]
*  And at the same time, at least those in Congress are pretty hamstrung by being in the minority. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=141.66s)]
*  Is there anyone who people see as rising above that as you're talking to strategists and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=145.82s)]
*  others putting together this rising stars list? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=150.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a good question because there is not much they can do. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  And that's what they're reminding voters almost at every turn. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=155.58s)]
*  I think Brian Schatz is someone it's important to note actually is doing something. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=158.18s)]
*  He said right after Trump was trying to dismantle USAID, the Hawaii Democrats said, I'm going [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=162.26s)]
*  to place a hold on every single foreign policy nomination and make Trump work to get these [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=167.42s)]
*  nominees across the finish line. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=172.5s)]
*  So he's using his leverage in the Senate, which every individual center has that right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=174.44s)]
*  Remember, Tommy Tuberville did a similar thing with the FETS nominations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=178.38s)]
*  And in the Senate, you can assert that power. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=181.54s)]
*  But in the House and other places, Democrats are very limited. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=184.1s)]
*  Can you just give me the names of a few House members? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=187.61999999999998s)]
*  I know we love the Senate, but we're House people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  We've got a soft spot for them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=192.26s)]
*  Any rising stars on that side? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=193.33999999999997s)]
*  I think Jasmine Crockett is someone who is omnipresent on cable news and social media. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=194.58s)]
*  Maxwell Frost is a very young Gen Z member of Congress who young people are looking to. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=198.98s)]
*  And I think it's that kind of media savvy next generation of young Robert Garcia, a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=203.98s)]
*  number of members, comes to mind. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=207.9s)]
*  They can really perform on new media, talk to influencers, get on Instagram reels, maybe [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=209.7s)]
*  even TikTok. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=214.22s)]
*  And that's where a lot of the voters who are maybe frustrated are turning to get their [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=215.56s)]
*  news. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=218.7s)]
*  Turning there and then also people like Pat Ryan in New York who won one of those tough [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=219.7s)]
*  races that people are like, hey, can we replicate that politically across the country? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  Max Cohen, Max Cohen, tracking these rising stars for us. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=226.52s)]
*  Thank you for coming on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=229.96s)]
*  And earlier in the show, we asked you, why are you awake? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=231.56s)]
*  One viewer emails, I'm getting an early start on celebrating my unbirthday as there is no [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  February 29th this year to celebrate my leap year birthday. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=239.36s)]
*  As they say in Alice in Wonderland, a very merry unbirthday to you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=242.76s)]
*  Kayla is awake with seven month old twins who are early risers. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=246.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=250.68s)]
*  And Don is still awake in California. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=251.84s)]
*  He writes, I swear I'm going to start going to bed earlier, but it's your fault for making [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=254.32s)]
*  the news so interesting. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=257.72s)]
*  Max, you're keeping people awake in California. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=259.08s)]
*  Save the people, let them go to bed, but not during this show or morning joke. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=262.96s)]
*  So stay up a little bit longer. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05lTH8Rf_g&t=266.40000000000003s)]
