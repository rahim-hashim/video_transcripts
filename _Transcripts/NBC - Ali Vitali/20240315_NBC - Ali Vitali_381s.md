# Trump walks back comments on cutting entitlements
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E)
*  Former President Donald Trump is trying to walk back comments he made earlier this week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=0.0s)]
*  about potentially cutting spending on entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=4.4s)]
*  Here's what Trump said on Monday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=9.92s)]
*  There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting, and in terms of also [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=13.32s)]
*  the theft and the bad management of entitlements, tremendous bad management of entitlements. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=20.8s)]
*  There's tremendous amounts of things and numbers of things you can do. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=26.36s)]
*  So I don't necessarily agree with the statement. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=31.0s)]
*  I know that they're going to end up weakening Social Security because the country is weak. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=34.92s)]
*  After days of backlash following that CNBC interview, Trump is now trying to change his [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=40.64s)]
*  tune. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=45.16s)]
*  In an interview with the far-right outlet Breitbart, Trump promised he will, quote, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=46.16s)]
*  never do anything that will jeopardize or hurt Social Security or Medicare. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=49.96s)]
*  The Biden campaign responded to the cleanup with this statement. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=54.16s)]
*  Donald Trump tried cutting Social Security and Medicare by billions of dollars every [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=57.68s)]
*  single year he was in office. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=61.54s)]
*  Then he confirmed Monday he wants to try again if elected. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=63.44s)]
*  And now his campaign thinks they can trick voters because they tell the Pulitzer winners [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=66.56s)]
*  at Breitbart the opposite. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=71.5s)]
*  Some snark there from Wilmington. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=73.64s)]
*  Also, with speculation mounting around who Trump will pick to be his running mate, new [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=75.6s)]
*  reporting reveals that the former president has been informally interviewing potential [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=79.88s)]
*  cabinet members. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  According to Bloomberg, Trump has discussed the possibility of hedge fund billionaire [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=84.83999999999999s)]
*  John Paulson serving as Treasury secretary in a possible second term. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=88.96s)]
*  Paulson is a substantial Trump donor, recently hosting a $1 million per person fundraiser [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=93.8s)]
*  for Trump at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=100.12s)]
*  Earlier this primary season, Trump mentioned Paulson during a speech as a potential fit [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  at Treasury, saying, quote, he makes a hell of a lot of money. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=107.68s)]
*  Joining us now, politics editor for Bloomberg, Laura Davison. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=112.44s)]
*  Good to see you, Laura. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  So Trump's last Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, was a former Goldman Sachs executive [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  and extraordinarily wealthy himself, as was his Commerce Secretary, Will Ross. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=123.28s)]
*  We know that Trump prioritizes money in the people he likes to surround himself. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=127.28s)]
*  That would certainly, John Paulson, wouldn't fit the bill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Tell us more about what we know about Paulson, if that was to be a potential pick, and who [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=134.88s)]
*  else Trump might be looking at for various cabinet posts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so Paulson is a hedge fund manager. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=141.88s)]
*  He's wealthy, he's worth more than $4 billion, and has been a big Trump supporter. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=144.56s)]
*  He hosted this fundraiser for Trump a couple months ago, hosting another one already on [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=148.72s)]
*  the calendar. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=152.52s)]
*  So expect to see the people that Trump is looking at are also people who are either [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=153.52s)]
*  attending or hosting and writing big checks for these fundraisers. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=157.24s)]
*  This is something that Trump is looking closely at. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=161.88s)]
*  He's also looking at other folks to be Treasury. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=164.12s)]
*  This is going to be a key post. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=166.72s)]
*  So other big finance names, Jeff Yass, who's notably a big investor in TikTok, also Scott [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=167.84s)]
*  Bascent, another Wall Street name, and a familiar name from his last administration, Bob Lighthizer, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=173.0s)]
*  who was the key trade representative for his administration. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=178.0s)]
*  And we should note that Trump just met with Yass just before suddenly flipping on whether [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=181.16000000000003s)]
*  TikTok should be banned. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  So let's talk about the Social Security and Medicare issue here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  Facts are an inconvenient thing for Donald Trump, as the Biden campaign points out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=192.0s)]
*  He did, in fact, try to cut it while in office and suggested again this week that he might. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=195.44s)]
*  The president's campaign has pounced on it, and Biden himself on the road in the Midwest [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=201.76s)]
*  this week talked about it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=206.34s)]
*  Tell us how big of a role this issue will be between now and November. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=208.64s)]
*  This is going to play a huge issue. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=212.72s)]
*  Of course, the majority of voters are people who are nearing retirement or will be who [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=214.56s)]
*  are already retired. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=219.44s)]
*  Medicare and Social Security are key pillars of people's everyday well-being. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=220.88s)]
*  It's also notable that Nikki Haley, who was Donald Trump's opponent in the primary race [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=226.2s)]
*  just until a few days ago, she had plans to cut Social Security, raise the retirement [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=230.2s)]
*  age, and Donald Trump went after her for that very aggressively. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=236.84s)]
*  We now see this pivot to the general election where he's saying, oh, well, maybe I might [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=240.56s)]
*  do something with Social Security, with Medicare. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=243.72s)]
*  This is going to be a key tension point and something that Democrats really feel like [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  they have the upper hand on with voters. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about Project 2025, which is Trump loyalist extreme plans to remake the federal [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=253.44s)]
*  government in Trump's image. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=258.96s)]
*  If he were to be reelected, they would slash parts of bureaucracy, staff other parts of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=261.08s)]
*  the government with pure right-wing ideologues. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=265.2s)]
*  Talk to us about what we have learned as to what Project 2025 would look like and what [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  kind of warnings are Democrats sounding. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=273.96s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a project the Heritage Foundation is heading up, and basically it's two parts. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=276.92s)]
*  One, it's a bunch of policy doctrines. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=280.96s)]
*  So they published hundreds, if not thousands, of pages of sort of policy prescriptions for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=282.68s)]
*  a second Trump White House, as well as started taking in resumes and vetting potential candidates [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=287.04s)]
*  for Trump's second term if you were to win. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=292.44s)]
*  Important to note here that the Project 2025 and the Trump campaign don't necessarily get [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=295.24s)]
*  along. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=299.68s)]
*  They're not necessarily working in lockstep. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=300.68s)]
*  You know, the Trump campaign has sort of pooh-poohed some of these efforts and said, you know, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=301.68s)]
*  They don't work for us. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=305.44s)]
*  We are going to decide who's in a Trump White House. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=306.44s)]
*  Trump is famous for maybe deciding he likes someone and then changing his mind at the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=308.52s)]
*  last minute. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=312.48s)]
*  So this is something that Democrats have sounded the alarm on saying, look, these are extreme [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=313.72s)]
*  positions. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=318.8s)]
*  We should be very closely looking at what this project is. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=319.8s)]
*  But there's also a lot of both a tension between the people who are heading this up as well [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=322.8s)]
*  as the Trump campaign who doesn't like when other people speak for him or make policy [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  decisions for him. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=330.4s)]
*  Yeah, certainly real tension there. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=331.6s)]
*  Also, we should note again that when Trump took over the RNC, they ousted about 60 staffers [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=333.8s)]
*  there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=338.52s)]
*  Again, some believed not sufficiently loyal. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=339.52s)]
*  And as far as Project 2025 goes, that's what so many Democrats point out when they say, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  look, think about the stakes of the next election. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=346.88s)]
*  Think about what could change in our country if Trump were to win again. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=349.52s)]
*  We will certainly be keeping an eye on it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=353.08s)]
*  And we appreciate the reporting this morning from Laura Davison, politics editor for Bloomberg. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=355.0s)]
*  Laura, thank you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=358.92s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=359.92s)]
*  And thanks. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=360.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBd90jyEL9E&t=363.76s)]
