# House Dems Unveil Changes To Prevent Future Presidential Abuses | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ)
*  Welcome back. House Democrats unveiled a sweeping package of changes designed to strengthen Congress's ability to check the executive branch and prevent abuses of power, especially by the president. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The package includes measures to restrain the president's power to grant pardons and declare national emergencies, to prevent federal officials from enriching themselves, and to accelerate the process of enforcing congressional subpoenas in court. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=12.0s)]
*  It also includes provisions to protect inspectors general and whistleblowers, increase penalties for officials who subvert congressional appropriations or engage in overt political activity, and safeguard against foreign election interference. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=26.0s)]
*  The measure represents the Democrats' attempt to correct what they have identified as systematic deficiencies during the course of President Trump's tenure and his impeachment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=39.0s)]
*  Joining me now, the co-chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=48.0s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for being here, for getting up early with us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=54.0s)]
*  I really appreciate it. And it's a very important day to have you as well because of what we saw from the president yesterday in essentially refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=57.0s)]
*  What's your reaction to what the president had to say? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=69.0s)]
*  What will Democrats try to put in place to do something about it? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=72.0s)]
*  And what do you expect from your Republican colleagues in Congress on this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=77.0s)]
*  So good morning, Casey. It's good to be with you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=81.0s)]
*  And as you know, this is my hour. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=84.0s)]
*  I'm one of the people that's in the office by 530 in the morning. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=86.0s)]
*  So I'm the only person you don't have to ask to get up to do you. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=89.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=93.0s)]
*  Well, then I'm sure we'll see you a lot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=96.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=98.0s)]
*  I am just extremely disturbed by what the president said yesterday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=99.0s)]
*  When you have a president of the United States who is refusing to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, when you're hearing the reports that have been reported in the last few days, but more publicly about Republicans targeting state legislators that are controlled by Republicans, not following what the actual outcome of the election is. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=103.0s)]
*  You know, I try to be very careful. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=125.0s)]
*  I'm someone who traditionally tries to keep people together. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=127.0s)]
*  But when you are threatening the very fundamental roots of our democracy, which is what we are watching right now, it is a time to be concerned. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=130.0s)]
*  You are hearing more and more people talk about how are we going to protect our democracy? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=137.0s)]
*  What is going to happen on Election Day? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=142.0s)]
*  And I'm very worried because this is a democracy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=144.0s)]
*  We do not have a tyranny. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=148.0s)]
*  So, Congresswoman, this is all happening, of course, as we've been grappling with what happened yesterday with Breonna Taylor, where the police officer who fired the shot that killed her was not charged. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=152.0s)]
*  No one, in fact, was charged for her death. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=166.0s)]
*  That's led to protests. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=169.0s)]
*  And we saw some violence in Louisville last night with two police officers killed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=171.0s)]
*  That's already generating another round of back and forth about violence in the streets between Vice President Joe Biden and Donald Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=174.0s)]
*  It's all a very volatile backdrop for this question about a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=182.0s)]
*  First of all, what was your response to what happened in the Breonna Taylor situation? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=191.0s)]
*  And what would you say to those people who are out there protesting so close to Election Day? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=197.0s)]
*  Well, you know, this is a complicated subject. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=205.0s)]
*  I have participated in more than 20 Black Lives Matter rallies, demonstration walks, marches, and very calm communities that don't normally even become involved or engaged in politics because they're concerned about what's happening in this country. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=209.0s)]
*  I, like Vice President Joe Biden, do not believe in violence. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=226.0s)]
*  I think peaceful protests are a means of being heard. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=231.0s)]
*  Martin Luther King told us that riots are the voices of the unheard. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=236.0s)]
*  You know, I'm told that the law is not strong enough in Kentucky. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=242.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=248.0s)]
*  I think state legislators there have a responsibility to look at the law so that they can hold people accountable. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=250.0s)]
*  I was not on that grand jury. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=257.0s)]
*  I was not part of that trial. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=259.0s)]
*  But obviously, Breonna Taylor died. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=261.0s)]
*  And it was a frontline worker. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=264.0s)]
*  And it's sort of like the man that got shot in Wisconsin seven times in the back. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=267.0s)]
*  And we still don't understand why he was shot in the back seven times in front of his three children. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=275.0s)]
*  And we saw a white 17-year-old walk down the street with an automatic weapon not stop and killed two men. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=281.0s)]
*  So there clearly is in this country a difference in how a white person and a black person gets treated. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=290.0s)]
*  And we need criminal justice reform. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=298.0s)]
*  But we don't want violence. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=301.0s)]
*  We want our democracy to bring people together. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=303.0s)]
*  We want equality for all. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=307.0s)]
*  These are very troubled times. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=309.0s)]
*  And we're going to have to be engaged because I will not sit quietly by and watch a dictator take over our government. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=311.0s)]
*  And I think all of us have not wanted to articulate that, have had worries, are worried. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=319.0s)]
*  But the fact that a sitting president of the United States would not commit to a peaceful transfer of government means every elected official has responsibility to protect our government. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=325.0s)]
*  And we cannot sit quietly or silently. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=336.0s)]
*  As someone who has covered you and all of your colleagues, I take to heart that you are using a word like dictator. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=342.0s)]
*  I realize very well that you have been someone who has tried to be measured in approach. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=351.0s)]
*  And I think it's telling for all of our viewers to understand that people who have tried to work together across the aisle have been very alarmed by this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=355.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, I hope you'll come back and talk about Michigan because we unfortunately are out of time. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=363.0s)]
*  And I really want to talk about that with you next time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=367.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R-4c-OXDQQ&t=369.0s)]
