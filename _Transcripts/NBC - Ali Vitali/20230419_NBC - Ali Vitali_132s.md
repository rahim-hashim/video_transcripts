# DeSantis meets with Republicans in D.C.
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M)
*  What's your take right now about the state of the race? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Is DeSantis just, it seems like he's spinning his wheels. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=2.04s)]
*  Yeah, it feels that way. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump has really no better base [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=6.84s)]
*  than the House Republican Conference. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  And I don't think it's all that surprising [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=11.6s)]
*  that he's racking up a lot of endorsements. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=13.34s)]
*  If you're a House Republican, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=16.16s)]
*  if you're somebody on the ballot, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=17.2s)]
*  it is a much safer place to go with Donald Trump, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=19.04s)]
*  who you know, you know, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=21.52s)]
*  Ron DeSantis doesn't pose a big threat to you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=23.2s)]
*  He's not gonna be able to attack you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=25.36s)]
*  and hurt you in a meaningful way. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=26.68s)]
*  But if you endorse Ron DeSantis, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=27.96s)]
*  there's a very real chance that Donald Trump [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=30.160000000000004s)]
*  could mess with you in your district, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  could weaken your support. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  But a lot of this is just, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=35.440000000000005s)]
*  members are looking at the same polling [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  that we're all looking at. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=38.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is well ahead of Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=40.0s)]
*  The idea of Ron DeSantis has not really been as exciting [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=42.44s)]
*  as what we've seen as, I guess, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  potential candidate DeSantis. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=48.02s)]
*  And the meeting yesterday was probably not his best setting. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=50.260000000000005s)]
*  I've been around Ron DeSantis a little bit. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=52.72s)]
*  He's not the most charming person. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  So when he got people in a room [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=55.86s)]
*  and they wanted to see whether this was the person [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  who had the it factor to take Donald Trump, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=59.56s)]
*  it's not actually surprising to me [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  that a lot of members didn't see that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=63.64s)]
*  And some of them walked out and then said, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=64.84s)]
*  they're still gonna endorse Donald Trump. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=66.12s)]
*  It's all about their own personal politics [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=68.0s)]
*  and the safest place to be [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=69.88s)]
*  is still with the former president. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=70.88s)]
*  And Brendan, real quick, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=72.48s)]
*  do you think there's any, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=73.64s)]
*  there's some growing chatter that some Republicans [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=74.56s)]
*  are urging DeSantis to wait a cycle, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=77.08s)]
*  to make 28 his move instead? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=78.68s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=80.4s)]
*  That's always been my view. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=81.76s)]
*  Look, there's a lot of risk to going after Donald Trump, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=83.4s)]
*  trying to run against him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=86.12s)]
*  You're going to take on a lot of fire. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=87.08s)]
*  Ron DeSantis has a lot that he can offer, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=89.64s)]
*  but if you lose this time, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=92.12s)]
*  if you lose against Donald Trump, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=93.24s)]
*  you're damaged goods. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=95.48s)]
*  And so I think it's actually a really, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  something he should really think about. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=98.32s)]
*  You gotta be confident that you can actually take him down [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=99.96s)]
*  if you're gonna get in the ring. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  Punication strategist and former aide [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=104.36s)]
*  to House speakers Ryan and Bader, Brendan Buck, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=106.48s)]
*  we will have you back real soon. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=108.82s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=110.2s)]
*  I'm Ron DeSantis. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=112.32s)]
*  I'll see you next time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=113.16s)]
*  Bye. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=114.0s)]
*  Bye. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKY7asBgp3M&t=114.82s)]
