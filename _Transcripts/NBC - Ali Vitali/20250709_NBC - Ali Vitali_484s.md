# More than 100 dead, 160 missing in Texas floods
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko)
*  In Texas Hill Country, a community that is now mourning the deaths of at least 110 people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=0.0s)]
*  30 of them children, after flash floods ravaged the region late last week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=5.32s)]
*  Today, five days after those deadly storms, Texas Governor Greg Abbott says more than [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=9.84s)]
*  160 people are still missing in the Kerr County area alone, which saw some of the worst of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=13.96s)]
*  that fatal flooding. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=19.36s)]
*  But the governor vowed not to give up the search. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=20.36s)]
*  Know this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=24.64s)]
*  We will not stop until every missing person is accounted for. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=27.64s)]
*  Know this also. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=32.64s)]
*  There very likely could be more added to that list. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=33.64s)]
*  Texas is in this with the people in the Hill Country right here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  We are not leaving until this job is finished. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=42.36s)]
*  Governor Abbott also said that the emergency alert system would be addressed during a special [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=47.64s)]
*  session of the state legislature later this month. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=52.36s)]
*  It comes as questions continue to mount about the Texas community's preparedness and response. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=55.2s)]
*  Also today we're learning more about what residents faced as Friday night's storm rained [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  down. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=64.36s)]
*  NBC's Morgan Chesky, who grew up in this area, spoke with a 10-year-old camper at Camp Mystic [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=65.36s)]
*  who described the moments when raging floodwaters began to rise. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=69.84s)]
*  People from like different cabins started coming to our porch and yelling like, wake [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=75.08s)]
*  up and go to Rec Hall because there's a flood. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=79.0s)]
*  How would you describe that four-hour window where you didn't know how Lucy was? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=82.0s)]
*  I mean just the longest four hours of my life. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=87.04s)]
*  She was wrapped up in a blanket and had a teddy bear. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=90.44s)]
*  We just held each other tight and I held her all night, you know, and just so grateful [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=93.08s)]
*  to God. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=99.38s)]
*  So grateful and joining us now, NBC News senior national correspondent Jay Gray, live still [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=102.08s)]
*  from Kerrville, Texas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  Jay, we've been talking to you over the course the last few days. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=107.64s)]
*  What's the latest today as the sun comes up on this community? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Look, I'm going to tell you, Ali, the news yesterday that more than 160 here in Kerr [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=113.8s)]
*  County alone, a gut punch to this community. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  It's already really, we know that teams back out and back at it today and they're going [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=126.2s)]
*  through areas like this along the Guadalupe River. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=131.24s)]
*  You can see the debris that's piled up here, the trees that have been pushed over, and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=133.94s)]
*  so they're sorting through all of this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=139.2s)]
*  They're going to start removing some of this in the hopes of finding some of those who [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=141.6s)]
*  are missing in this spot. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=146.32s)]
*  Late yesterday, they pulled a car from under the water. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=147.92s)]
*  And so this is just a process that's going to continue. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=151.92s)]
*  The governor talked about staying here until everyone is found. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  And how are they going to do that? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=159.16s)]
*  We learned yesterday they're bringing in more resources. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=161.64s)]
*  Four more Blackhawk helicopters have been brought in. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=164.48s)]
*  We know that other teams from around the country are moving in to help with those who have [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=167.92s)]
*  already been working around the clock for what is now going into the sixth day of this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=173.2s)]
*  search, rescue, and recovery. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=178.0s)]
*  We also know that they are asking at this point residents who have damaged property, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=180.64s)]
*  who have homes that have been damaged, don't move anything. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=187.04s)]
*  They want to get in and make sure that no one is trapped under that debris. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=191.12s)]
*  That's something they're really stressing in this area right now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=195.32s)]
*  And again, when you talk to the responders here on the ground, they say that they're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=199.72s)]
*  not going to leave. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=205.0s)]
*  The governor has said that, but they say looking straight in the eye that we're going to find [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=206.16s)]
*  everyone. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=211.88s)]
*  And if that means bringing some closure instead of bringing someone home alive, we're going [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=212.88s)]
*  to do that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=218.04s)]
*  And we're going to make sure that everyone here is located and found. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=219.04s)]
*  I should say one other thing, Ali, and talking last night with some of those who have been [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=222.44s)]
*  on the ground and going through all of this, they say that they weren't surprised at all [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=227.48s)]
*  at that new revelation from the governor about the number of missing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=232.16s)]
*  In fact, one man told me last night he thinks the number could climb much higher. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=236.52s)]
*  NBC News senior national correspondent Jay Gray reporting live this morning from Kerrville, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=242.16s)]
*  Texas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=247.8s)]
*  We appreciate your work. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=248.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=249.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Donald Trump confirmed during a cabinet meeting yesterday that he [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=250.8s)]
*  will travel to Texas to visit this devastated area later this week. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=253.88000000000002s)]
*  I'll be going down on Friday with First Lady. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  We'll be taking a trip and we don't want to get in anyone's way because that's what happens. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=263.6s)]
*  The president goes and everyone's around focused on. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=269.2s)]
*  I don't want anyone to focus on us, but it's possible they could have they could have somebody [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=272.64s)]
*  saved still. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=278.96s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of areas. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=279.96s)]
*  It's a big area and probably unlikely at this point, but there could be this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=281.96s)]
*  They're thinking there could be the possibility. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=289.32s)]
*  But what a tragic situation. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=292.0s)]
*  We're all holding out that kind of hope. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=295.68s)]
*  But in that same cabinet meeting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spoke about [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=297.54s)]
*  the federal response to the floods. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  We as a federal government don't manage these disasters. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=304.96s)]
*  We do what the state does. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  We come in and support them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's exactly what we did here in this situation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  We're cutting through the paperwork of the old FEMA, streamlining it much like your vision [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=314.5s)]
*  of how FEMA should operate. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=319.18s)]
*  And it's been a much better response to help these families get through this terrible situation. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=320.66s)]
*  Noem bringing up FEMA there is important because this all comes as the administration has been [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  moving to cut the disaster response and relief agency. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=331.68s)]
*  The president himself has previously talked about getting rid, his words, of FEMA. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=334.86s)]
*  But in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophic Texas flooding, the president is avoiding [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=339.53999999999996s)]
*  talk now of scrapping that agency, telling reporters over the weekend that it isn't the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=343.46s)]
*  right time to talk about it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=347.78s)]
*  And when asked on Monday whether the president was reconsidering his plan to eliminate FEMA, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=349.38s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt told reporters it was, quote, a policy discussion [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  that will continue. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=357.9s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for Bloomberg, Kayla Gardner. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=359.5s)]
*  So you write in your latest piece for Bloomberg that some Democrats are calling the cuts at [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=362.42s)]
*  the National Weather Service for those to be investigated. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=367.02s)]
*  It makes sense given the concern on the ground about who was alerted and when. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=370.64s)]
*  Could there have been more done in advance that could have saved lives? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=375.4s)]
*  But what do you see in the way that the White House is talking about this, where those investigation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=378.76s)]
*  calls might actually lead? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=382.94s)]
*  Well, the president and the White House generally has really defended the cuts that they've [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=384.3s)]
*  made to the National Weather Service. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=387.7s)]
*  They've been pointing out a union statement specifically that said that there was adequate [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=389.65999999999997s)]
*  staffing locally on the ground. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=393.34s)]
*  But I think the bigger question is, again, cuts in general, including to FEMA. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=395.5s)]
*  The president said that he wants the agency to be phased out by the end of hurricane season [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=399.34s)]
*  of this year. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=404.21999999999997s)]
*  He has not ruled that out yet, as you said, that he's been avoiding talking about it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  So you can assume that that is still the plan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=408.82s)]
*  And you heard Norm sort of suggesting that, that she wants to continue to see sort of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=411.26s)]
*  the streamlining of FEMA continue. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=415.46s)]
*  But at the same time, there are concerns about moralization within the federal workforce. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=418.3s)]
*  There has been major cuts to scientific agencies in the federal level and to federal funding [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=422.54s)]
*  at universities at the scientific level as well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=427.66s)]
*  And so there's concerns about whether the people who are in those jobs are satisfied [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=430.06s)]
*  with the cuts that they've seen and the resources that they have currently. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=433.98s)]
*  I think this is also probably potentially going to beg a larger question about the fact that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  there are really very few federal minimums for emergency response systems. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=442.26s)]
*  I mean, I did stories on this earlier this year, and it really is up to states and localities [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=447.14s)]
*  to set up their own 911 systems, to set up their own emergency response systems, early [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  siren alert systems, as we're talking about here in Texas. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=456.58s)]
*  I wonder if that's a kind of policy conversation that is also spurred out of this. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjHb_Jw-ko&t=459.42s)]
