# Trump slams potential 2024 GOP rival DeSantis
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA)
*  I was asked the other day and I took a little heat for it. They said, who's our biggest threat? Is it China sir? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=0.0s)]
*  Or is it Russia? I said no our biggest threat are [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=6.48s)]
*  high-level politicians that work in the United States government like Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=11.0s)]
*  Schumer, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=19.6s)]
*  Biden, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=21.68s)]
*  Justice Department, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=24.16s)]
*  because that's poisoning our country. I can do things with China. I made the greatest trade deal in history with China. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=26.32s)]
*  That's former president Trump at his weekend Waco rally weighing in on what he called the greatest threats to the United States. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=33.84s)]
*  Trump also called out potential 2024 GOP rival governor Ron DeSantis during the rally [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=42.16s)]
*  highlighting his increasing edge over the Florida Republican in recent polling while also slamming him on COVID. Take a look. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=47.92s)]
*  They keep saying oh, I think DeSantis can do okay with farmers. I don't think so. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=57.12s)]
*  Based based on polls, he's not doing okay with anything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  But in the case of Florida, they unfortunately did shut it down. They shut down the beaches. They shut down everything. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=66.64s)]
*  So now that people are finding out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  about what happened, they're saying man, he's dropping like a rock and I wonder why but [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=74.08s)]
*  you know, you never like it when [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=78.72s)]
*  somebody comes you see I'm a loyalist. They say sir don't talk about that sir [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  because people don't want to hear that but I do because I'm a loyal person. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Sir, if you endorse me, I'll win. Please, please sir endorse me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  And I said, all right, let's give it a shot because honestly the secretary of agriculture [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=96.8s)]
*  Adam Putnam, good man, but I never met him. I didn't know him. So I don't feel guilty about it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=102.56s)]
*  You know, if you don't know somebody, I wish I knew him actually you want to know the truth. I wouldn't have done this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=107.2s)]
*  So what happened is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=111.68s)]
*  I said, let's give it a shot Ron. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=113.6s)]
*  And I endorsed him and he became like a rocket ship. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  Within one day the race was over. He got the nomination, but when you're [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=120.0s)]
*  getting a guy so he gets the nomination because of you. He wins the election because of you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=125.36s)]
*  Two years later, the fake news is up there saying will you run against the president? Will you run? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=130.72s)]
*  And he says I have no comment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=139.12s)]
*  I say that's not supposed to happen. I have no comment. No, so I'm not I'm not a big fan. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=141.6s)]
*  Joining us now national political correspondent for politico Meredith Mcgraw. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=151.52s)]
*  She was at the rally in Texas and writes about it in her newest piece for politico. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=156.24s)]
*  Meredith, you were there. Lucky you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=161.68s)]
*  What were some of your [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Key takeaways from the rally set the scene for us in terms of crowd size and enthusiasm. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  And what were some of the key messages that former Trump tried to deliver? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=171.76s)]
*  Well, thousands of Trump's Texas supporters lined up for hours in the hot sun there to get a glimpse of the president to hear from him and to hear his message. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=176.72s)]
*  And what they ended up hearing wasn't exactly a vision for a second term, but [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=186.08s)]
*  It was a list of Trump's grievances. He went after his political rivals. He talked about his investigations [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=191.28s)]
*  And went on about a lot of the issues that are facing him as we wrote in our report [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=198.8s)]
*  There was kind of a familiar feel to this a lot of these rallies end up kind of feeling the same [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  There were some new twists to it official campaign [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=208.56s)]
*  Signage that said quote witch hunt and it really seems like Trump's making a big bet here for his 2024 [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=211.9s)]
*  campaign [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  Where he thinks that talking about these investigations talking about issues that are facing him is actually going to be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  A political asset to him and something that will fire up his base [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  But what's yet to be seen is if that will move the needle past? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=234.18s)]
*  Anyone but his core of supporters. Yeah, so let's explore that a little further you wrote [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=239.46s)]
*  in your piece about the rally that there were [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=245.06s)]
*  Uh several rallygoers there who expressed disappointment that governor de santis had not done more [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=247.62s)]
*  Uh to defend trump as he stares down all of these investigations including the possible indictment from the manhattan da [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=253.14s)]
*  Tell us the republicans you talk to there. What's the what's their feelings about this trump de santis rift? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=261.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's so interesting when you're talking to folks on the ground a lot of um trump supporters there do like de santis [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=266.66s)]
*  They like his policies they like what he's done in florida, but they'd like for him to just stay there [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=273.38s)]
*  What was interesting when I was um talking to some of them though and as we noted in our in my in the piece was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=278.1s)]
*  They expressed disappointment that de santis didn't go far enough in defending trump [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=285.06s)]
*  They felt like he poked fun at trump and mocked him in his response [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=290.18s)]
*  one of them called him a traitor [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=296.18s)]
*  Said that de santis was going after trump's character something they said that trump doesn't do [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=299.14s)]
*  but [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=304.66s)]
*  They they thought that de santis should be coming more to trump's defense here and for a lot of the people that I talked to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=305.54s)]
*  at the rally [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=312.66s)]
*  They were you know, very supportive of trump as he's going through these investigations and really phrased [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=314.58s)]
*  Um trump's legal situation and a lot of the same terms he used up there on stage [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=322.02s)]
*  So marinette, of course the world's been watching laura manhattan and then that in da's office wondering if an indictment will come [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=327.86s)]
*  Uh in the days ahead [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=333.14s)]
*  Uh, well as we wait and trump continues to post on truth social well after midnight. What's next for the campaign? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=335.14s)]
*  This was the rally everyone been looking to for a while. What else do they have on the schedule? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=341.53999999999996s)]
*  What's going to be their approach this week during this legal waiting game? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  Um, I think it's a lot of wait and see trump's legal team has said that they've been largely in the dark [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  And even though trump made that prediction last week that he would be arrested on tuesday, obviously that didn't happen [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=353.94s)]
*  So like all of us they're waiting to see what happens with this manhattan grand jury. All right. Well meredith mcgraw [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=360.02s)]
*  Thank you again for being with us this morning. We of course will be reading your latest for politico up next [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=365.61999999999995s)]
*  You [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfkjbI2o2KA&t=383.78s)]
