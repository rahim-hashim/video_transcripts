# FDA commissioner pledges to investigate Mifepristone
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg)
*  And the FDA commissioner is pledging to launch an investigation into the abortion drug Mifipristone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes after Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri pressured the agency to review [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=5.74s)]
*  that drug. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=9.88s)]
*  In a letter to Senator Hawley, Commissioner Marty McCary wrote that he is committed to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=11.06s)]
*  conducting a review of Mifipristone but did not provide further details due to ongoing [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=15.42s)]
*  litigation surrounding the drug. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=19.88s)]
*  HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also pushed for a review of the pill in recent [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=22.12s)]
*  weeks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=26.44s)]
*  The FDA first approved Mifipristone 25 years ago and more than 100 scientific studies have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=27.44s)]
*  found it to be safe and effective for ending a pregnancy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=32.36s)]
*  Joining us now, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, Mini Timaraju. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=36.36s)]
*  So Mini, let's start right there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is an issue that Trump himself was purposefully wishy-washy on during the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  2024 election, but now we're watching the administration take multiple actions in this [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=45.6s)]
*  vein. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=51.2s)]
*  Let's start on Mif. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=52.2s)]
*  What should people know about this drug and why it's being reviewed right now? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=53.86s)]
*  So Mifipristone is part of the abortion pill regimen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=57.86s)]
*  It allows folks, particularly in this moment where you have 20 to 21 states with extreme [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=61.5s)]
*  bans and restrictions, access to care through telemedicine. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=66.78s)]
*  It makes it so that you can have an abortion in your home, in the privacy of your home. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=70.92s)]
*  It's also widely used in miscarriage management. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=76.06s)]
*  So it's so important that this drug stays on the market. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=78.5s)]
*  Over 60% of all abortions in this country are now done by Mifipristone. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=82.1s)]
*  So it's honestly going after Mifipristone in many ways as a backdoor abortion ban because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=85.78s)]
*  it would impact abortion access in states with access to care, mostly blue states and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=91.78s)]
*  purple states, where folks have gone to the ballot and said, I want to protect abortion [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=96.97999999999999s)]
*  access in my state. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  It's been on the market for over 20 years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=102.86s)]
*  It does not need to be reviewed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  There is plenty of evidence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  And it is widely used and considered a really top tier drug for women's health care. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=109.34s)]
*  So the case that went to the Supreme Court was around a fringe group of activists in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=116.98s)]
*  Texas who claimed that Mifipristone was incorrectly authorized by the FDA. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=122.26s)]
*  And it really ended up being about their standing since they were really a bogus group and whether [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=129.9s)]
*  the FDA should be undermined by activists. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=134.7s)]
*  And it opened up so many cans of worms. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=137.42s)]
*  So the court sent it back and did not rule on it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=139.54s)]
*  And this is important. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=142.5s)]
*  I think that's actually a tension point throughout everything we talk about on reproductive health [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=143.5s)]
*  care. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=148.22s)]
*  I mean, you and I were talking in the break a story that I did on the first anniversary [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=149.22s)]
*  of Dobbs. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=151.94s)]
*  A provider in Texas told me I went to medical school. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=152.94s)]
*  I know how to help people. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  And yet these laws are making me question that if I do, am I going to get sued? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=157.62s)]
*  Am I going to be open to liability? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  Where does that leave me? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  And that, I think, directly presents itself in something else that we saw from the administration, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=165.34s)]
*  the rolling back of something called EMTALA, which is basically saying if you show up to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=169.82s)]
*  an emergency room, initially it was meant to just say doctors have to cover you regardless [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=174.82s)]
*  of if you can pay and you're having an emergency situation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=178.94s)]
*  In 2022, there was an extra protection added that said if you need abortion care, this [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=181.9s)]
*  falls under that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=186.62s)]
*  We saw the administration pull that back yesterday. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=188.06s)]
*  What's the impact on the ground then? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  So the whole reason the administration issued the guidance applying EMTALA to emergency [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=192.32s)]
*  abortion care in states like Idaho, which was the state that challenged it, is because [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=198.04s)]
*  literally patients were getting airlifted from Idaho to neighboring states because doctors [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  were afraid. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=208.4s)]
*  Their abortion was so extreme and restrictive, they were afraid to do emergency care when [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=209.92s)]
*  the life of the mother was at stake. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  So there's a reason the Biden administration issued that guidance. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=217.92s)]
*  And it's dangerous. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=221.16s)]
*  The Trump administration has rescinded it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=222.16s)]
*  Dr. Oz tweeted about it and called it fake news that it was an extreme action. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=224.56s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is women will die because they've rescinded EMTALA because you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=229.6s)]
*  have states like Idaho that were already questioning whether or not they could do this care. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=234.24s)]
*  We have evidence that states with extreme bans were already refusing care. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=239.32s)]
*  And that is frightening. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=243.84s)]
*  And we're also seeing then people have to find other options. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=245.42s)]
*  You have this patchwork of rules where if you laid out the map where the restrictions [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=249.4s)]
*  are and then the states that have longer rules around when and when you cannot access abortion [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  care, you end up with this patchwork of rules across the country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=259.08s)]
*  And so women who happen to be in a certain state could have very few options and they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=261.96s)]
*  might have to travel to others. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=266.12s)]
*  I talk to people in Colorado often who work in this space and they say they have seen [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=267.72s)]
*  a massive influx of women coming from Texas, from other states around them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=272.48s)]
*  Talk a little bit about what the challenges are to that because there's tons of travel [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=277.28s)]
*  and logistics restrictions for people who are just trying to access health care. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  So this is actually why mythiopristone is so important. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  In this moment where a patient may have to travel from like a Texas to a New Mexico, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=287.96s)]
*  being able to cross the border, get access to care, having the telehealth, being able [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=293.0s)]
*  to have the follow up, this is so critical. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=297.7s)]
*  So the question I have is why do legislators and why is the attorney general of Texas and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=300.4s)]
*  Louisiana, why are they going after providers in blue states like New York, which is a case [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  that's happening right now, to punish patients and providers who are crossing lines to have [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=310.48s)]
*  access to the care? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=315.24s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=316.24s)]
*  They want to hold these women hostage in their states. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=317.24s)]
*  And that is really, really disturbing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=319.56s)]
*  That's why so many states like New York have shield laws. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=322.2s)]
*  These are laws to protect providers from providing care to patients out of state who are coming. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=325.0s)]
*  And you've got governors like Kathy Hochul who are really making a stand and saying we [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  will protect women and patients coming from all over the country. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=335.3s)]
*  But we're in effect a segregated country now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  States with bans and states with access to care. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=341.26s)]
*  And we have to fight to protect patients from being able to travel and providers from being [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=343.94s)]
*  protected when they provide that care. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the travel piece is something that abortion funds do a lot of work around. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=349.78000000000003s)]
*  But you're right, Governor Kathy Hochul, Congressman Pat Ryan, who's this is a constituent in his [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=353.34000000000003s)]
*  district, the provider that's being gone after in Texas. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=358.14s)]
*  This is the next wave of that battle. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=362.0s)]
*  And I think it's really important for us to highlight this for folks who there's so [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=364.12s)]
*  much going on. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=367.24s)]
*  It's hard to pay attention, but the stuff's really important. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=368.24s)]
*  Mene Temirajou, always appreciate you. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=370.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=372.2s)]
*  The silver. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqHQI-9Oeg&t=373.2s)]
