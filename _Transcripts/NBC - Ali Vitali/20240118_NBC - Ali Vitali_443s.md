# Trump considering Rep. Elise Stefanik as running mate
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ)
*  Nikki Haley supported Rhino Paul Ryan's 2011 plan to destroy Medicare, the same plan that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=0.0s)]
*  led the Democrat ads, which was a disastrous ad, showing Republicans wheeling granny off [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=7.0s)]
*  the cliff. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=12.64s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=13.64s)]
*  That was Paul Ryan throwing granny off the cliff. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=14.64s)]
*  We're not doing that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=17.46s)]
*  We're not taking care of our grannies like that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=18.46s)]
*  And speaking of grannies, tomorrow, I have a funeral for the mother who was a great woman [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=21.06s)]
*  of Melania, our first lady. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=27.72s)]
*  So that was Donald Trump in New Hampshire last night, making quite an abrupt transition [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=32.56s)]
*  from attacking Nikki Haley to mentioning a funeral he'll be attending today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=36.62s)]
*  After spending the afternoon in court in New York, Trump was in New Hampshire delivering [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=41.84s)]
*  a particularly erratic speech. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=45.68s)]
*  We're also learning that Trump may have a possible running mate in mind. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=47.68s)]
*  According to an exclusive NBC News report, the former president is eyeing Republican [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=52.08s)]
*  Elise Stefanik as his potential vice president. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=56.58s)]
*  Stefanik was the first member of Congress to endorse the former president this election [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  cycle. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  The Trump loyalist backed his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and filed multiple ethics [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=65.17999999999999s)]
*  complaints about the judge overseeing Trump's legal cases. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=70.14s)]
*  Last month during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Trump allies mentioned Stefanik following [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=74.62s)]
*  her questioning of three university professors at a hearing on anti-Semitism. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=79.18s)]
*  Trump reportedly nodded in approval of the VP's suggestion, telling guests, quote, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=84.38s)]
*  she's a killer. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  Stefanik announced she will campaign with Trump in New Hampshire tomorrow. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now, national political reporter for Politico, Meredith McGrath. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=95.3s)]
*  Meredith, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=99.78s)]
*  You've been covering this campaign so very closely, and your new piece for Politico focuses [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=101.5s)]
*  on Trump's escalating attacks on Nikki Haley. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  So talk to us about what Trump team is telling you about trying to, frankly, finish off [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=109.98s)]
*  Haley in New Hampshire, because if Haley can't win there, this race might be all but over. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=115.54s)]
*  Yeah, Donald Trump and his campaign have been really working, as you said, to finish off [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=120.7s)]
*  Nikki Haley in New Hampshire, as his former UN ambassador keeps saying that this is a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=125.94s)]
*  two-person race between her and Donald Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=130.98000000000002s)]
*  Two polls that came out yesterday in the state of New Hampshire showed that Donald Trump [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=135.18s)]
*  still has a pretty sizable lead there in the state, with Nikki Haley coming in second. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  But he has really escalated his attacks on her in recent days. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=145.62s)]
*  Last night at his rally in New Hampshire, he really hammered on her record. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=149.26s)]
*  He talked about what she was like as his UN ambassador. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=154.1s)]
*  He talked about her record on immigration and Social Security. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=158.22s)]
*  And even as he's assailing her at these rallies, he's also really taking an aim at her on social [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=162.26s)]
*  media, where some of his attacks have been pretty personal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=167.38s)]
*  He's talked about her given first name from her Indian immigrants. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=171.18s)]
*  He's suggested a conspiracy theory that she's ineligible to run because her parents were [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=176.82s)]
*  immigrants when they came here and weren't U.S. citizens yet. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=182.5s)]
*  And he's also posted memes just yesterday comparing her to Hillary Clinton. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=188.46s)]
*  So he's really making an aggressive move to try to make sure that he has a sizable win [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=194.42s)]
*  next week in New Hampshire. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  So let's be clear, Haley is eligible to run for president. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=209.1s)]
*  We'll fact check that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=210.1s)]
*  So how is Haley responding? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=211.1s)]
*  I mean, we talked to Natasha Korecki earlier in the show, and she said that some Republicans [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=212.1s)]
*  have voiced concern that Haley's campaign schedule in New Hampshire has been pretty [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=216.42s)]
*  light. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=219.54s)]
*  She's not attacking Trump as hard as they feel like she needs to. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=220.54s)]
*  What's your sense as to what these next five days or so could look like for Haley in the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=223.7s)]
*  Granite State? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=227.14s)]
*  Well, Nikki Haley has been fact checking Trump when she's been talking to voters there in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=228.14s)]
*  New Hampshire. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=233.3s)]
*  She did that yesterday. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=234.3s)]
*  I'm trying to correct the record when it comes to immigration and her stance on Social Security [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=235.3s)]
*  and Medicare. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=240.82s)]
*  And her campaign yesterday, before Trump took the stage, released a video that ticked through [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=242.3s)]
*  Donald Trump has complimented her and her role in his administration. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=248.74s)]
*  And a Haley supporting super PAC had billboards outside of Trump's rally yesterday running [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  ads and talking about Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=260.62s)]
*  So they are pushing back. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=262.86s)]
*  And she has faced some criticism there in the state of New Hampshire for having a schedule [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=264.58s)]
*  that some view as lighter. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=270.94s)]
*  But we did find out yesterday that Nikki Haley's dad has been sick. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  And so she went down to South Carolina to spend time with him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=276.82s)]
*  And, you know, Donald Trump going to his mother-in-law's funeral today, I think these moments kind [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=281.17999999999995s)]
*  of just remind all of us that at the end of the day, these are all human beings, too, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=287.02s)]
*  in addition to being presidential candidates running around these states. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=291.26s)]
*  Yeah, certainly a good point. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=294.82s)]
*  And also, there's been some tough winter weather in New Hampshire as well that has hindered [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=295.9s)]
*  the campaigning. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  Meredith, let's talk about it's still pretty early in the process to be thinking VP. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=300.09999999999997s)]
*  But Trump, you know, as we just reported, has been chatting about some candidates. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=305.86s)]
*  There's a sense among some Republican circles that he'll likely pick a woman. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=309.94s)]
*  Kristi Noem, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Carrie Lake, Elise Stefanik, all possibilities. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=313.94s)]
*  What's the latest you've heard about the running mate process? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=317.98s)]
*  So it's so interesting. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=321.58s)]
*  Last week, Donald Trump was asked about his running mate at the Fox News town hall he [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  had in Iowa. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=328.46s)]
*  And he said that he knows who he's going to pick. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=330.02s)]
*  It seemed to take his advisers by surprise, but Donald Trump's statement there certainly [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  raised eyebrows and suggests that, you know, maybe he really does have a specific name [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=337.66s)]
*  in mind. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=342.74s)]
*  There has been a lot of talk about him potentially picking a woman to run with him on the ticket [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  as part of an effort to maybe get some more suburban female voters to come out for him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=349.18s)]
*  And you know, Stefanik would make sense as a potential choice. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=355.98s)]
*  She's shown that she's a great fundraiser. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=360.22s)]
*  She obviously has a lot of connections on Capitol Hill and really raised her profile [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=363.26s)]
*  nationally after her appearance with the university presidents earlier this year. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=368.02s)]
*  So you know, it would make sense that she would be on the short list. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=375.74s)]
*  You know, we had reported before Christmas that Trump had been asking similar things [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=379.94s)]
*  about Nikki Haley. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=385.02s)]
*  It's hard to imagine now with the way he's attacking her that she would still be under [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=386.5s)]
*  consideration. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=391.1s)]
*  It is something that it seems like Trump is on, a VP is on his radar and he's been asking [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=392.3s)]
*  people questions like, what do you think of Nikki? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=398.18s)]
*  And according to the NBC News report, what do you think of Elise Stefanik? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  And certainly Trump in the past has done a very abrupt 180 about people when they start [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=406.98s)]
*  praising him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=411.58000000000004s)]
*  So we shouldn't rule out Nikki Haley. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=412.58000000000004s)]
*  I guess if suddenly Haley were to drop out of the race and start endorsing Trump, she [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=413.86s)]
*  could be back in the mix. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=417.98s)]
*  National political correspondent for Politico, Meredith McGrath, thank you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=419.66s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgsCEkXiiGQ&t=421.98s)]
