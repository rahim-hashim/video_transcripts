**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y)
*  A country where we watch violence erupt, this cannot be the norm. It cannot be the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  way that we deal with our political differences. Now is the time for us to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=8.0s)]
*  recommit to the core values of this country and each and every one of us can [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=12.48s)]
*  do it. Talk to a neighbor rather than arguing. Debate an issue. Shake hands. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=17.96s)]
*  Find common ground. Find common ground. Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz late [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=24.2s)]
*  last night with a message of unity comes after the capture of the man [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=29.84s)]
*  suspected of shooting two lawmakers in Minnesota. Good morning and welcome to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=33.4s)]
*  way too early on this Monday June 16th. We're gonna start right there with that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=38.28s)]
*  breaking news. The suspect in a pair of targeted shootings of Minnesota lawmakers [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=41.84s)]
*  is in police custody this morning. After two day manhunt, two sleepless night, law [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=46.16s)]
*  enforcement have apprehended Vance Bolter. That's 48 hours that law [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=54.64s)]
*  enforcement involved in a complex and dangerous manhunt. Vance Bolter has been [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=59.12s)]
*  charged with two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder after a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=66.52s)]
*  multi day manhunt that's been called the largest in state history. Authorities [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=69.92s)]
*  say on Saturday, Bolter impersonated law enforcement to gain access to the homes [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=74.08s)]
*  of state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband before he assassinated [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  them. He allegedly used the same method to shoot state Senator John Hoffman and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=81.76s)]
*  his wife, Yvette. They're both still hospitalized with severe injuries. The [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=85.76s)]
*  shootings have been described as politically motivated. Bolter abandoned [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  his car at the Hortman's home after a shootout with police and then fled. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=93.2s)]
*  Officers say they found a list of other lawmakers and officials in that car that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  appear to be future targets. They believe Bolter acted alone but are still [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=100.68s)]
*  investigating if he was part of a quote broader network. I want to go first to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  the ground. NBC senior national correspondent Jay Gray live with us this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=109.48s)]
*  morning from St. Paul, Minnesota. Jay, what's the latest where you are? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=112.64s)]
*  Well, Ali, let's show you behind me. They've got a growing memorial here. In [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=119.6s)]
*  fact, we've already seen people early morning out at the memorial to the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=123.12s)]
*  victims and we're learning more about that manhunt you talk about. It was a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=126.44s)]
*  massive team of officers and federal agents stalking the suspect through the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=129.96s)]
*  woods, then making their move just after nightfall, closing in and circling him [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=135.04s)]
*  and then commanding him to crawl to where they were. We're told that he was [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=141.04s)]
*  armed at the time of his arrest, but that there was no confrontation and that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  none of the law enforcement officers use their weapons during the arrest. He [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=151.78s)]
*  had been on the run for more than 40 hours, was arrested about 50 miles or so [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=158.56s)]
*  to the southwest of where the attacks took place, and it was just a few miles [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=164.76s)]
*  from his home. Now they were first called back to that area when they [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=169.84s)]
*  identified a vehicle that they suspected he had been driving after the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=173.92s)]
*  attacks. It was abandoned along the roadway there. And then while there, a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=177.92s)]
*  resident provided them with a tip saying that they saw them running through the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=181.52s)]
*  woods, and that's when they initiated this massive search and were able to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=186.8s)]
*  pinpoint him. They tell us that they also use drones as well as a chopper, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=191.76s)]
*  infrared technology to find out exactly where he was and then just inch by inch [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=196.2s)]
*  moved in until they finally closed that circle around it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=201.56s)]
*  NBC's Jay Gray on the ground for us there in Minnesota. Thank you for joining [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  us and we're gonna have more from the ground. Senator Amy Klobuchar joining us [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  later this morning on Morning Joe. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abqvkZxbn9Y&t=213.68s)]
