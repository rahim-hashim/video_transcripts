# Online donors raise thousands of dollars for CEO murder suspect
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU)
*  There's a growing online campaign to raise money for CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=0.0s)]
*  Get this, more than $70,000 have been donated to a fundraiser for Mangione's legal defense. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  People are also posting messages supporting the 26-year-old and celebrating the death [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=13.26s)]
*  of United Hell Brian Thompson. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=18.84s)]
*  Many of the comments expressed frustration over the country's health care system, with [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=21.1s)]
*  users sharing their own personal stories of being denied insurance coverage. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=24.84s)]
*  Joining us now to talk about this, U.S. special correspondent for BBC News, our friend, Cady [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=30.04s)]
*  Kay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=35.28s)]
*  Cady, so good to see you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=36.28s)]
*  I mean, let's be clear. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=37.28s)]
*  There are plenty of reasons to be angry at the health care industry, endorsing violence, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=38.28s)]
*  endorsing murder of a man, a father, just crosses every sort of line. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=41.92s)]
*  But talk to us about what you see, what this symbolizes here for the country, where there's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=47.28s)]
*  such anger, not just the health care industry, but institutions writ large. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=52.36s)]
*  Yeah, and we saw some of this even before the election, didn't we? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=56.8s)]
*  How much dissatisfaction there is with American institutions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=59.8s)]
*  If you take all of the polling, it shows that, you know, from us, the media, through to business, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=63.64s)]
*  through to politicians, approval ratings are so low, and health care industry is down there [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=68.88s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=74.52s)]
*  I personally was surprised by the amount of online outrage about the health care industry [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=76.32s)]
*  and the online support for Manjoni. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=83.55999999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't look, Jonathan, like this is some kind of interference from a foreign entity, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=86.6s)]
*  from what I understand. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  It looks like this is organic. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=94.56s)]
*  This is homegrown. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=96.24s)]
*  It's genuine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  It looks like it is. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  It's the kind of thing where you think maybe the Russians would step in and cause divisions [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  in American society, but I don't think that's what we're seeing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=103.52s)]
*  It does look to be genuine American outrage at the health care industry and a sort of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=106.6s)]
*  and a surprising callousness, frankly, about the killing of this individual. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=119.56s)]
*  Now, let's be clear here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=120.56s)]
*  Donald Trump, nothing to do with this incident whatsoever, but he is someone who has used [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=121.56s)]
*  for his political advantage the anger institutions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=126.0s)]
*  for years. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=129.48s)]
*  And he's done so in part by contributing to that anger, by attacking those institutions, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=130.48s)]
*  vilifying them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  And now it does seem like that's part of what set the tone in the country for this not only [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=136.48s)]
*  anger at these big things that people don't feel like are helping, but also help propel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=141.72s)]
*  Trump's victory this past November. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=147.12s)]
*  There's a different language in the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  And that's certainly the case since Donald Trump came onto the scene in 2016, the way [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=152.0s)]
*  he talks about from the very moment he came down the escalator about sending us rapists [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=156.68s)]
*  and drug lords across the country and criminals, the way he's talked about people that has [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=163.32s)]
*  changed the way that politicians that we're not used to politicians at the top using the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=169.2s)]
*  kind of language that Donald Trump has. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=175.04s)]
*  And that cascades right down through the system and people's language more generally then [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=177.56s)]
*  becomes more crass. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=182.84s)]
*  I don't know that that necessarily translates into OK, a vigilante system of justice is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=184.84s)]
*  now acceptable and the norm in America because of what one person says in the chief executive's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=192.08s)]
*  office. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=197.72s)]
*  That seems a bit of a stretch. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=198.72s)]
*  But I think I have spoken to a few people since this killing who have said, are we headed [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  for a period where people feel it is OK to try and trade retribution? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=205.0s)]
*  They'll find out they're wrong and that they will end up in prison. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  The American justice system does hold and that Mangione will get served due process [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=214.08s)]
*  in this particular instance. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=220.48s)]
*  But there is a kind of feeling of a slight kind of toxic feeling of anger meets we don't [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=222.44s)]
*  trust institutions where and it's OK to take things into our own hands. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=227.08s)]
*  But Cady, let's go on that a little further in our final minute here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=231.8s)]
*  This normalization of the idea of political violence, the fact that Mangione is cheered [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=235.8s)]
*  on by people online and also we heard it again yesterday, Donald Trump pledging to pardon [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=240.8s)]
*  those who were convicted for the January 6th riot, including those who committed violent [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=246.32s)]
*  acts within the first nine minutes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=250.6s)]
*  He is now telling us I don't know why particularly it's nine minutes. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  But anyway, within the first nine minutes, he sounds like he is going to make good on [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=257.08s)]
*  his word. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=262.36s)]
*  He was sometimes a little coy about this out on the campaign trail, not wanting to give [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=264.04s)]
*  specifics, but it looks like he's going to have an incredibly busy first day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  I thought the other part of that that was interesting is not just what he said about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=274.88s)]
*  the January 6th defendants who are in prison, but also what he said about drill baby drill. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=278.72s)]
*  And I think we're going to see a lot of executive actions on that first day that lift regulations [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=283.12s)]
*  around protecting the environment when it comes to fossil fuels and extraction of fossil [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=288.88s)]
*  fuels. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=294.4s)]
*  It's clear that this is an administration that is going to go perhaps more than anything [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=295.2s)]
*  else that it does. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=302.88s)]
*  It's going to go full bore on business and pushing what billionaires and business leaders [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=303.92s)]
*  in the American community want. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=311.2s)]
*  And that is why you are seeing the ball go down to Mar-a-Lago to make cozy with Donald [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=313.6s)]
*  Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exploring lifting potentially banking regulations, too, some really important ones. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=318.32s)]
*  U.S. Special correspondent for BBC News, Kadeke. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=322.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=324.8s)]
*  Stick around. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=325.12s)]
*  We'll talk to you again on Morning Joe in a minute. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvLv0BP78tU&t=325.52s)]
