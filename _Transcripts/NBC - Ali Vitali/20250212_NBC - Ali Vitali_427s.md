# Trump accelerates Guantánamo Bay migrant plan
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk)
*  The branches have to respect our constitutional order, but there's a lot of game yet to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=0.0s)]
*  played. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=5.8s)]
*  Those will be appealed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=6.8s)]
*  We've got to go through the whole process. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=7.8s)]
*  And we'll get to the final analysis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=9.28s)]
*  In the interim, I will say I agree wholeheartedly with Vice President J.D. Vance, my friend, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  because he's right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=16.12s)]
*  What they're doing in the executive branch, I've been asked so many times, aren't you [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  uncomfortable with this? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=20.32s)]
*  No, I'm not, because when Congress, for example, appropriates dollars for the executive branch [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=21.32s)]
*  to use, we build in, not only in the spirit of the law, but in the letter of law, a broad [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=25.84s)]
*  amount of discretion for how that is used. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  And there's a lot more to come. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=33.36s)]
*  And I think that the courts should take a step back and allow these processes to play [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=35.08s)]
*  out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  What we're doing is good and right for the American people. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  That was House Speaker Mike Johnson yesterday talking about the role of Congress and the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=43.64s)]
*  courts in assessing the Trump administration's agenda. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=48.56s)]
*  Joining us now, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=51.96s)]
*  He's also the former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, and an MSNBC and NBC political analyst. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=54.44s)]
*  Secretary, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=59.76s)]
*  First, as a former member of a presidential cabinet, I want to get your read on what's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  happening between the Trump administration and the court system as they try to effectively [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=65.2s)]
*  dismantle various pieces of the federal government. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=69.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, this is crazy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  Mike Johnson there said, well, we give a lot of latitude, a broad discretion basically [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  to the executive branch. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=81.68s)]
*  And of course, there is a good amount of discretion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  I would just point out, Ali, as you know, that when the shoe was on the other foot, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=85.8s)]
*  these Republicans were trying to prescribe to the very, you know, decimal point how the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=89.96s)]
*  Obama administration or the Biden administration spent these dollars. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=95.88s)]
*  But then secondly, he's saying, well, they have discretion to how on how they use these [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=99.52s)]
*  funds. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  But in some cases, they're talking about not using these funds at all, doing away with [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=105.32s)]
*  complete agencies or parts of agencies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  And so it does seem as though the executive branch is trampling all over the job of the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=112.92s)]
*  legislative branch. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=118.16s)]
*  And the fact that Mike Johnson and other Republicans won't even say a negative word here is just [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=119.76s)]
*  flabbergasting. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=126.08s)]
*  It's like they're giving up their job. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=127.08s)]
*  And I don't think that this is what the American people voted for. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=129.2s)]
*  I do think it's fascinating to see the speaker of the House effectively undercut one of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=133.56s)]
*  central roles of his legislative body. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=137.84s)]
*  But putting that aside for a moment, I also want to touch on concerns about the Trump [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=141.0s)]
*  administration's holding migrants at Guantanamo Bay. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=144.48s)]
*  This is yet another action amid the flurry of actions in the first few weeks of this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=147.6s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=151.48s)]
*  Can you talk about your concerns over how the Trump administration is disobeying the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=152.76s)]
*  courts here when it comes to immigration and just the optics of sending migrants to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Gitmo? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we know Guantanamo, right, from a conversation that we've had, unfortunately, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  over these last 20 years as a place that's shrouded in secrecy, a place that specifically [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=169.44s)]
*  is designed for al-Qaeda-related accused terrorists and people who have been held there for years [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=174.4s)]
*  and years. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, this is the same place now that the Trump administration says they want to send [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  30,000 migrants to. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=187.8s)]
*  Already one district court in New Mexico has enjoined the administration from sending [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  three Venezuelans to Guantanamo because the administration basically has not proven up [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=195.84s)]
*  that the people they want to send there would fall within the law that covers who can actually [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=202.56s)]
*  go there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=207.6s)]
*  So aside from the humanitarian concerns, which are very real given the track record of Guantanamo, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=209.12s)]
*  and that's why presidents have been trying to close Guantanamo for some time, there's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=214.84s)]
*  also the concern that this is a breaking of the law. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=219.04s)]
*  And again, and this is the true line, we're headed toward a constitutional crisis if the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=222.88s)]
*  Trump administration in this instance, like others, decides, hey, you know what, we don't [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=227.76s)]
*  need to listen to the courts. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=233.04s)]
*  We're going to go ahead and do what we want to do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=234.04s)]
*  As they do that, Trump's not going to be on the ballot again in 26 or ever again, even [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=237.84s)]
*  though he may want to. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=242.52s)]
*  But it becomes a bigger and bigger problem for those congressional representatives that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=244.0s)]
*  especially are in swing districts, for senators like Tom Tillis and Susan Collins, who are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=248.48s)]
*  up for reelection in 26, and also for all of these Republicans that think they're going [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  to run for president in 2028. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=258.8s)]
*  Go and explain to the American people that you basically trampled all over the Constitution [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=261.08s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=265.4s)]
*  I don't think that's a winning move or a winning message. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=267.0s)]
*  I do think it's important that we keep our eyes on the prize when it comes to the potential [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=270.0s)]
*  and the way that the administration and key members are toying with. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  Do we adhere to what the courts are saying? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=277.28s)]
*  Do we not? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=279.0s)]
*  At this point, they are working through the appeals process on various of these items. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=280.0s)]
*  But I want to drill down with you, because in addition to your resume, you also ran for [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  president in 2020. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  I covered that campaign. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  And immigration was such a central focus for you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=289.73999999999995s)]
*  But it does feel, in my conversations on Capitol Hill, like many Democrats feel, they've lost [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=292.46s)]
*  the plot when it comes to immigration policy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=297.4s)]
*  And so as much as Trump is enacting a very restrictive and hawkish agenda on immigration, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=300.08s)]
*  there are Democrats on this issue. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=306.56s)]
*  It feels like they say broadly, well, we support border security, but there's no clear policy [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=308.0s)]
*  drill down on what that actually means. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  Where should your party be looking right now as they try to reestablish on that issue? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, of course, there was legislation that was compromised legislation that almost [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=319.12s)]
*  made it to the finish line. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=326.24s)]
*  But Trump spiked it and congressional Republicans in the end didn't go along with it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=328.08s)]
*  I think that Democrats both need to point out all of the problems with what the Trump [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  administration wants to do on immigration, which I think most Americans feel is too extreme, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=340.1s)]
*  even though, yes, in 2024, there was a more conservative approach on immigration than [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=345.22s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=351.98s)]
*  No doubt about that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=352.98s)]
*  The times were different. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=353.98s)]
*  But the problem with the Trump administration is I think they're overreaching. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=355.66s)]
*  So Democrats need to point that out and then also put forward a positive vision on immigration. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=358.84s)]
*  How can you address concerns at the border, but also treat people humanely? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=364.64s)]
*  The problem, Ali, between 2021 when Biden took over and then the election of 2024 is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=369.76s)]
*  that I think Biden, I said this many times, he never put forward that positive vision. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=375.84s)]
*  He never really pulls back as things went further and further to the right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=381.12s)]
*  Democrats should not make that mistake. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  They're going to have an opportunity because the Trump administration is already going too far. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=387.64s)]
*  Yeah, I have heard many people who are looking back at the Biden administration thinking [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  that they left a vacuum on this issue and now it's an active debate within the party [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=396.36s)]
*  and on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=400.0s)]
*  Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, thank you for getting up with us early this morning. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=401.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cdQl2jUtpk&t=405.24s)]
