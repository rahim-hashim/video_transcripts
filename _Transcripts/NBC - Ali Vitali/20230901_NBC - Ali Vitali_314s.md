# White House calls for short-term spending bill
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY)
*  Welcome back. President Joe Biden is proposing a new rule that would close the so-called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=0.0s)]
*  gun show loophole. The plan would require anyone who is selling a gun for a profit to get a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=6.08s)]
*  federal license and conduct a criminal background check whether they sell the weapon in a store [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=12.22s)]
*  or at a gun show. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives currently license [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=17.36s)]
*  roughly 80,000 brick and mortar gun dealers. However, gun sales are increasingly happening [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=23.2s)]
*  outside of that system and being done without background checks. The new rule will go through [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=30.2s)]
*  the federal rulemaking process and will surely be challenged in court by Second Amendment [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=35.16s)]
*  activists. The White House is also urging Congress to pass a short-term government funding [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=41.0s)]
*  measure to avoid a shutdown at the end of the month. The Biden administration is asking [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=46.72s)]
*  lawmakers to approve money for cash-starved programs such as nutritional aid. But the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=51.48s)]
*  Office of Management and Budget warns that a stopgap won't be enough, saying programs [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  like WIC need an extra $1.4 billion. Without that money, officials say the government may [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  be forced to put families on waiting lists, causing women and children to go hungry and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=68.84s)]
*  into poverty. But some House Republicans want to roll back programs for nutritional aid. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=74.4s)]
*  Those far-right lawmakers are breaking from the deal that Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=80.68s)]
*  with President Biden back in the spring to raise the nation's debt limit. That agreement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  was supposed to prevent another stalemate over spending. Joining us now, someone following [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=90.4s)]
*  this closely, White House reporter at Politico, Adam Cancron. Adam, great to see you this [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=95.72000000000001s)]
*  morning. So let's start there with this, what seems to be impending showdown on government [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Give us a briefing as to where everyone stands, the likelihood of a short-term resolution [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=106.76s)]
*  to keep things spending. When's the government going to run out of money? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=113.64s)]
*  Yes, so the big deadline here is September 30th. Congress needs to essentially solve [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=117.72s)]
*  this and get a deal that would take us at least through December without a government [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=124.2s)]
*  shutdown. Now, if you remember, we went through this back during the spring when there was [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  a concern about going over and going through the debt ceiling, that would have been an [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  economic catastrophe. Congress, the president were able to work out a deal that averted [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=136.44s)]
*  that. As part of that, the idea was that things would be settled once we got to the fall. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=141.56s)]
*  We wouldn't have to go through another big spending fight. But as you mentioned, House [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=146.48s)]
*  conservatives, the Freedom Caucus, have now kind of tried to go back on that deal, saying, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=151.4s)]
*  you know, actually, we want to revisit it. We want more spending cuts. That's created [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  now this stalemate. There are some big decisions that are going to be made when the House comes [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=160.6s)]
*  back September 12th. Kevin McCarthy, the speaker there, needs to determine what he can get [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=165.04s)]
*  support for in his own caucus while also still trying to keep his word to the deal that he [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=170.28s)]
*  made with the White House. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=175.92s)]
*  And certainly a part of this, too, is also Ukraine funding. That's going to be part of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  this negotiation. So, Adam, let's say that a short-term resolution is reached now that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=180.56s)]
*  kicks the can down the road to December. Would that be potentially more likely that we're [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=185.32s)]
*  going to be staring at a government shutdown then? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=190.28s)]
*  If we can somehow avoid this now, yes, there's a likelihood that we're going to be right [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=193.32s)]
*  back here in December. The hope, though, as you mentioned with the supplemental funding, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=197.16s)]
*  there's about $40 billion that the White House is seeking. That is for Ukraine aid, for disaster [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=202.44s)]
*  relief like we've seen is needed in Hawaii, and also now in Florida and the southern states. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=207.52s)]
*  Right now, that's kind of the top priority because that is money that's needed urgently [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=212.84s)]
*  just to fill the gap over the next three months. So the way that the White House is looking at this, the way that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=217.76s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are trying to get a short-term deal are looking at it is, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=221.72s)]
*  let's just get through September 30th. We'll worry about December later on, but there is money that's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=226.92s)]
*  needed now that needs to be secured now through this short-term deal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  And Adam, lastly and briefly, the gun show proposal that we just read through, how likely [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  is this proposal to becoming law? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=242.48s)]
*  Well, this is something that you're seeing the administration try to do on its own. There's obviously not the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=245.32s)]
*  bipartisan will in Congress to make big changes in terms of gun safety. And so this is something that the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=249.84s)]
*  administration can essentially do on its own through administrative regulations. The pathway is clear there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=256.2s)]
*  The question is, again, what kind of lawsuits will we see? What kind of court challenges? And how long [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=263.36s)]
*  that will tie up the ability for the administration to finalize that rule and get it actually into action. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the White House had been looking for a while to find some sort of executive action they can still take. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  They found this. We'll see what happens in the courts. Really good reporting this morning. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=279.12s)]
*  Adam Cankron, White House reporter at Politico, who is traveling with the president this weekend when he [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=283.8s)]
*  goes down to see the hurricane damage in Florida. Safe travels, Adam. Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=288.0s)]
*  Up next. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7CeoTR19yY&t=293.6s)]
