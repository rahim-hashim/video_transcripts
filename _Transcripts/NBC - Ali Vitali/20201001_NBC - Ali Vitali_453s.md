# Trump Allies Voice Concern After Debate Performance | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 01, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg)
*  Welcome back to way too early. It is 5 28 on the East Coast and 2 28 out west. I am [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=0.0s)]
*  Casey Hunt. Some of President Trump's top allies and advisors are privately voicing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=7.08s)]
*  concern over his debate performance this week. Gee, wonder why they say the president missed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=11.92s)]
*  repeated opportunities to hit Joe Biden in areas that they had prepped for like China [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=17.72s)]
*  and comments that the former VP has made in the past on race. People familiar with the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=22.32s)]
*  situation tell NBC News the mood around the campaign in White House yesterday morning was [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=27.16s)]
*  described as worried, quiet and in shock. The consensus among people close to the campaign [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  was that Trump's debate performance probably didn't lose him any voters among his base, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=38.08s)]
*  but that he needed to do more to hold his ground. According to the New York Times, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=42.76s)]
*  the president wasn't displeased with his own performance. Also not surprising. In fact, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=48.2s)]
*  three people close to the campaign told the Times that Trump was elated about the debate [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=53.12s)]
*  and saw it as a successful outing. The Times notes that some of Trump's advisors who shy away [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=57.96s)]
*  from giving him bad news made no attempt to disabuse the president of that assessment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=64.44s)]
*  Okay. Last night at a rally in Minnesota where once again there was no social distancing and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=70.48s)]
*  very little in the way of mask wearing, President Trump warned of the dangers of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=77.32s)]
*  allowing refugees to resettle in the state. Before again, going after Democratic Congresswoman [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=81.04s)]
*  and Somali refugee Ilhan Omar. Another massive issue for Minnesota is the election of Joe Biden's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=86.84s)]
*  plan to inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees. They pledged a 700% increase in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=95.52s)]
*  refugees. 700%. Congratulations, Minnesota. Congratulations. Now, and what about Omar, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=106.6s)]
*  where she gets caught harvesting? What the hell is going on? I hope your U.S. attorney is involved. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=116.6s)]
*  What? What is going on with Omar? I've been reading these reports for two years about how [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=125.84s)]
*  corrupted and crooked she is. Let's get with it. Let's get with it. I mean, frankly, harvesting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=130.92s)]
*  is terrible, but it's the least of the things that she has done. How the hell? Then she tells [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=140.72s)]
*  us how to run our country. Can you believe it? How the hell did Minnesota elect her? What the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  hell is wrong with you people? Biden will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. And he said that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  Overwhelming public resources, overcrowding schools and inundating your hospitals. You know that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=156.68s)]
*  It's already there. It's a disgrace what they've done to your state. Wow. This latest salvo follows [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=163.24s)]
*  the president's complaints last week that Omar shouldn't be critical of the United States, asking [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=170.96s)]
*  how is your country doing? Omar, who is a U.S. citizen, arrived in the United States as a child [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=175.52s)]
*  after her family fled war-torn Somalia. Joining us now, reporter for The Washington Post, Eugene [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=182.0s)]
*  Scott. Eugene, thank you so much for being here this morning. I want to start, we'll get to Ilhan [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=189.04s)]
*  Omar in a second, but I want to start with the reporting on the president's reaction to the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=194.72s)]
*  debate, which of course, the main, one of the main moments out of that was his comments about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  the Proud Boys and for him to come out and say, according to these reports, that he's proud of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=206.8s)]
*  the performance, that this was good for him. You know, I think says a lot about what he was trying [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  to do in the debate. This is something that we know he consistently does. We saw it in Charlottesville [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=220.08s)]
*  and in a series of other examples. Of course, his staff, afraid to tell him, no, actually, sir, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  we think this performance was a problem. Indeed. One of the things that was fascinating about this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=236.4s)]
*  debate is that if you read some of the comments from former White House aides, they said that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=242.56s)]
*  President Trump gave America a window into how he leads, how he governs during staff meetings. He [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=247.68s)]
*  talks over people. He pushes back on criticism. He launches personal attacks when someone doesn't [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=253.84s)]
*  support an idea of his. And so what we saw wasn't something that was abnormal from the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=259.92s)]
*  Trump administration, but a business as usual. And something else that is business as usual [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  coming from the president is a refusal to unequivocally push back on white nationalists [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=270.24s)]
*  and white supremacists. And this is why Joe Biden said he launched his campaign. If you recall, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=275.12s)]
*  in that video where he released why he was running for president, he cited Charlottesville. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=280.56s)]
*  And this is going to be something that's very frustrating for many supporters of Trump, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=285.6s)]
*  individuals working in the administration. But part of his legacy long after he leaves office, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=290.16s)]
*  be it next January or four years later, will be that this president was too close to people [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=294.72s)]
*  who viewed people who were not white as less inferior or worse human beings than white people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  That's such a good point about Biden and why he got into this race. I mean, that is a thread that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=307.92s)]
*  we have seen repeatedly from the former vice president. And things keep happening that [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=313.28s)]
*  motivate, that could motivate him in the same vein. And Eugene, you and your latest reporting [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=320.4s)]
*  for the Washington Post look at female voters in particular. How on earth could it be that the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=325.92s)]
*  president thinks that his debate performance would help among female voters? I mean, and even what we [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=332.96s)]
*  heard yesterday about Ilhan Omar, I mean, not very veiled comments that hit that same theme you were [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=338.24s)]
*  just talking about. Well, I think in the core of the Make America Great Again vision, as you already [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=346.96s)]
*  know, is this idea that America 50 years ago was better than America is today. And for Trump, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=353.52s)]
*  what's better than America is today. And for Trump and many of his supporters, that means [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=360.0s)]
*  embracing traditional ideas of gender, including masculinity. And so he embraces this idea that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=364.64s)]
*  being tough and aggressive is what women really want. And the reality is that since 2016, his [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=372.0s)]
*  polls have shown the exact opposite. Yeah, he won some women in 2016 and groups of women that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=378.0s)]
*  maybe people thought he perhaps would not. But early in his administration, he began losing [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=385.12s)]
*  support with women. One of the really fascinating things that I saw from following his debate [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=390.48s)]
*  performance that I highlighted in my piece were the number of women who said that Trump's performance [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=396.32s)]
*  reminded them of an ex-boyfriend or ex-teacher or ex-boss that was so uncomfortable that they [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=402.0s)]
*  could not get past, regardless of whatever points he may be making that were valid. And that is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=408.64s)]
*  causing them to not support him and back away from him in numbers and at rates that we have [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=414.0s)]
*  not previously seen. Well, when you think about it in those terms, I can understand why women, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=418.48s)]
*  myself included potentially, if the president reminded me of an ex-boyfriend, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=427.52s)]
*  I get it. I understand. The Washington Post, Eugene Scott, thank you very much for your time [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdzNPgToVSg&t=432.0s)]
