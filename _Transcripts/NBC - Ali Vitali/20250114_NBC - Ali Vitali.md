# House Speaker Johnson backs conditions on California fire aid
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson is backing placing conditions on federal aid for California amid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=0.0s)]
*  those devastating wildfires. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Johnson made the comment to reporters yesterday blaming the fires on mismanagement and mistakes [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=8.52s)]
*  of local leaders, while floating the idea that relief could be tied to the debt limit. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=13.56s)]
*  I think we've got to have a serious conversation about that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=18.56s)]
*  Obviously there's been water resource mismanagement, forest management mistakes, all sorts of problems. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And it does come down to leadership. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=30.28s)]
*  And it appears to us that state and local leaders were derelict in their duty in many respects. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=32.28s)]
*  So that's something that has to be factored in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=38.28s)]
*  I think there should probably be conditions on that aid. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=41.28s)]
*  That's my personal view. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=43.28s)]
*  We'll see what the consensus is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=45.28s)]
*  I haven't had a chance to socialize that with any of the members over the weekend. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=47.28s)]
*  We've all been very busy, but it'll be part of the discussion. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=49.28s)]
*  What about the debt limit increase? What about the time of debt limit increase, Tom? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=53.28s)]
*  There's some discussion about that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=56.92s)]
*  We'll see where it goes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=58.92s)]
*  In response, lawmakers are warning Johnson that tying relief to the debt limit could [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=60.92s)]
*  set a new precedent as disaster-prone states like Florida and Louisiana, which also happens [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=64.92s)]
*  to be Johnson's home state, could face similar issues if Democrats win back the House. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=69.92s)]
*  Joining us now is Democratic congressman Sidney Kamla-Gurdov of California. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=74.92s)]
*  We'll get to the politics of this moment in just a second because it's palpable. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=78.92s)]
*  But I want to hear from you, your experience on the ground over the weekend as you surveyed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=84.56s)]
*  the damage in your home state. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=88.56s)]
*  So last night I was on the phone with friends and family members who've lost everything [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=90.56s)]
*  in both the palisades and Altadena. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=96.56s)]
*  I didn't have enough tissue to get me through the night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=98.56s)]
*  Saturday we toured Altadena. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=101.56s)]
*  Entire blocks burned to the ground. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=103.56s)]
*  Sometimes just the chimney were standing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=106.56s)]
*  I mean churches, business centers, the school where my young son went to school. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=108.56s)]
*  Burned to the ground. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=114.2s)]
*  It is devastating. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=116.2s)]
*  Absolutely devastating. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=118.2s)]
*  And then you come back to Washington and you start hearing this conversation about potentially [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=120.2s)]
*  conditioning the aid, tying it with the debt ceiling, which is a Thornian issue as any [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=124.2s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=129.04s)]
*  What's your initial reaction when you hear that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=130.52s)]
*  It makes me question what kind of Christian Speaker Johnson is. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=132.52s)]
*  I hope that he would sit down with his Republican colleagues from California and listen to their [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=136.2s)]
*  stories as well. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=141.56s)]
*  And I invite Speaker Johnson to my district that's suffering now and to tour the devastation [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=143.36s)]
*  of those sites and look those residents, those Californians in the eye and tell them that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=148.36s)]
*  their rescue is being conditioned because he wants to play partisan politics with California. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=153.36s)]
*  It is untenable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=158.36s)]
*  Well, even Republican Senator from North Carolina, Tom Tillis, North Carolina, of course, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=159.36s)]
*  one of those states that just got the disaster relief aid at the end of the year for the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=164.36s)]
*  damage from the storms that happened in the fall, said we shouldn't be doing this and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=168.36s)]
*  playing this game with disaster funding. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  But it speaks to, I think, why we've seen so many members of the California delegation, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  your colleague, Congresswoman Chu, the governor himself saying he wants the president elect [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  to come to the area. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  He wants the speaker to come to the area. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  Is that because they want them to see it and then make sure that there's no retribution [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  or party politics in this? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  When you're on the ground and you can feel the pain and you can see the devastation and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  you see how much money it is going to cost to rebuild and you also recognize that the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=199.16s)]
*  character of Los Angeles could change fundamentally, I think then you realize that we have to have [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=204.16s)]
*  the funds that we need and the flexibility to reconstruct without these kinds of partisan [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=210.16s)]
*  discussions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=214.16s)]
*  I will say that California Democrats have been working with California Republicans on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=215.16s)]
*  this issue. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=219.16s)]
*  We are united. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=220.16s)]
*  So Speaker Johnson needs to get behind the delegation. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=221.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to ask what are those conversations like? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=223.16s)]
*  I was on the floor and so many folks came up to give me a hug. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=226.56s)]
*  Let me tell you, there are Republican donors who lost their homes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=229.56s)]
*  Okay, everyone is feeling this hit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=233.56s)]
*  And we know that climate change does not look at your voter ID to see if it's going to come [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=235.56s)]
*  for you or not. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=241.56s)]
*  So we have to get real about what is needed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=242.56s)]
*  It's not atypical if a speaker doesn't go and tore damage like this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=245.56s)]
*  They can, but it's not always the consistent thing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=249.56s)]
*  But what does it say if President-elect Trump, who will then be President Trump in a week, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=252.96s)]
*  ultimately doesn't go? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=256.96s)]
*  And it is under discussion right now with his team, but it's not for sure. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=257.96s)]
*  My understanding is that he's had conversations with the governor and Mayor Bass, both of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=260.96s)]
*  whom have invited him. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=265.96s)]
*  I was on the call last night, on a call last night with the Board of Supervisors, and they're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=266.96s)]
*  also interested in having him come. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=271.96s)]
*  So I hope he does come out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=272.96s)]
*  He has property in California. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=274.96s)]
*  I think he has a vested interest in making sure that we have what we need to prepare [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=276.96s)]
*  and the Olympics and so folks can come back to their homes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  So I just want to make sure I understood because when Newsom had spoken to NBC over the weekend, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  he said he hadn't heard back from Trump. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=287.96s)]
*  But your understanding is that since then, my understanding is he is looking at coming [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  out after the inauguration. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  Of course, I don't have a crystal ball, but that was information I got last night. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's certainly notable. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=299.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's Newsy. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  I wonder if you can zoom out a little bit. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  What does it portend for this Congress that it's starting out in its second week talking [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=304.76s)]
*  about conditioning aid to what happens to be a blue state? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=311.76s)]
*  I feel like we are running out of seatbelts. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=315.76s)]
*  That's how bumpy this Congress has already begun to be. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=317.76s)]
*  And we're not out of January. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=322.76s)]
*  We have got to put the pitchforks down and start recognizing that we're all Americans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=323.76s)]
*  The one thing that no leader can control is climate change. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=329.76s)]
*  We are dealing with unprecedented winds. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  We are dealing with a drought that we have had and no rain since May. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  There was no president, governor or mayor who can control all of that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  And so what we need to do is make sure that we are preparing for the next disaster so [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  that we can mitigate it and mitigate the enormity of what we are seeing right now in California. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and we are watching disasters in California and then also hurricane damage be worse than [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  ever. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you for waking up early with us. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for these updates from the ground. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcq5ca0nIWo&t=362.16s)]
