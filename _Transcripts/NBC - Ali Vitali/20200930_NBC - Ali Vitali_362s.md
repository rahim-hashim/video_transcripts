# President Trump Refuses To Denounce White Supremacist Groups | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4)
*  Hours before last night's debate, a conspiracy theory began floating around online that Joe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=0.0s)]
*  Biden was being fitted with a hidden earpiece. In a statement, President Trump's campaign accused [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=7.04s)]
*  Biden of backing out of an agreement that the two would be inspected for electronic earpieces ahead [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=12.56s)]
*  of the debate. The rumor was speculated about on Facebook and right-wing media, including Fox News. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=17.52s)]
*  Biden's campaign denies that it ever agreed to such an inspection, with one campaign staffer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=23.44s)]
*  calling the rumor, quote, completely absurd. Biden poked fun at the conspiracy theory before [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=28.32s)]
*  hitting the debate stage, tweeting a picture of headphones and a pint of ice cream, writing, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=33.84s)]
*  it's debate night, so I've got my earpiece and performance enhancers ready. Jenny's ice cream, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=38.16s)]
*  definitely a performance enhancer for me. Joining me now, spokesperson for Color of Change political [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=43.36s)]
*  action committee, Rashad Robinson. Rashad, good morning. Thank you so much for being here on this [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=48.56s)]
*  very important moment. I know you are focusing later on today on a campaign to hold Facebook [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=53.68s)]
*  accountable, but the thing I really want to talk to you about, and I'm happy to talk about Facebook's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=60.64s)]
*  role in this as well if you'd like to, is that moment where President Trump told the proud boys [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=64.64s)]
*  to stand by. I mean, that, I think all of us are struggling to grapple with the enormity of that, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=72.8s)]
*  and this is obviously not the first time he's done something like this. What was your reaction [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=80.64s)]
*  to this, and what do you think Americans need to do going forward into this election campaign season? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=85.76s)]
*  Well, I think we need to be vigilant. We need to recognize that it's not just the proud boys [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=94.16s)]
*  that exist. It's not just the other white nationalists that exist that have been [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=99.68s)]
*  given entree to raise their voices, to stoke violence in communities, to commit violent acts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=103.6s)]
*  In communities, it's that they've been enabled, and they've been enabled by big institutions and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=111.44s)]
*  corporations. We have fought to force major credit card companies to cut off them being able to be [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=116.16s)]
*  processed and being able to process fees and being able to raise money online. We've had to fight [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=122.8s)]
*  institutions. Basically, a couple of hours before the debate, I was in an email exchange with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  incredibly high level people at Facebook and a back and forth trying to explain to them why [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=137.28s)]
*  the Donald Trump Jr. post on Facebook enlisting an army of poll watchers should have violated [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  their platform. What I got was the same tone deaf things I continue to get from Facebook [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=150.32s)]
*  about explaining to me about how it doesn't violate it. Then just a couple of hours later, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=156.0s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't not only not condemn white nationalists, he tells them to stand [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=161.28s)]
*  by. Meanwhile, there is a post still up on Facebook from Donald Trump Jr. now calling enlisting an [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=168.08s)]
*  army of poll watchers to come and protect the president's results. We are living in a world [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=175.12s)]
*  where we have people who should be standing up and using their power to push back, but instead, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=182.56s)]
*  because of profit and growth, because of fear of regulation, they are willing to throw safety, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=188.56s)]
*  integrity, and security out the window. For the American public, what we have to recognize [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=194.48s)]
*  is that this is a threat and we have to do everything we can to stand up and push back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=201.2s)]
*  Facebook is clearly trying to suggest in the wake of the president's comments that they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=209.6s)]
*  have done what they should in terms of trying to address this group. They say that they booted [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  them off of the platform several years ago. Is that actually what's happened? How are the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Proud Boys and other groups like them interacting with our largest social media platforms? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=228.4s)]
*  We were going back and forth with them along with other groups this summer trying to get the Proud [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=234.16s)]
*  Boys booted off. It's one thing when someone says, we set up this policy to kick these groups off. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=240.56s)]
*  They set it back in 2018, but this summer, June 2020, they had to actually take the Proud Boys [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=248.96s)]
*  off the site because after months of going back and forth and after more uprisings that were [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=256.48s)]
*  happening after Proud Boys showing up in communities and continuing to use their platform, what they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=261.92s)]
*  actually said they had done had not happened. A ban is not a ban if no one is banned. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=267.84s)]
*  This is what Facebook continues to have a problem. They set policies and then they don't actually [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  enforce them. They don't actually become real policies. If we don't experience a change in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  the platform, then it hasn't actually existed. Now we're going to get a lot of defensive messages [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  from Facebook. We're going to get really caring messages about how hard they are working, how much [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=292.64s)]
*  they care, how much they take this seriously. The fact of the matter is that we know when Facebook [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  takes something seriously, when it's about making money, when it's about getting more advertisers [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=306.08s)]
*  on the platform, even when it was dealing with the coronavirus and the disinformation about the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=310.0s)]
*  virus, they could mobilize all sorts of forces to make things happen. It seems when it comes to the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=314.8s)]
*  safety, integrity, and security of our elections, when it comes to dealing with hate content on [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=320.64s)]
*  their platform targeted at black folks and Jewish folks and other communities that have been the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=326.24s)]
*  targets of white nationalists and white supremacists, we end up getting a lot of caring and not a lot of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=332.24s)]
*  action. All right, Rashad Robinson, we will be keeping an eye on that press conference later on [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  today. I really appreciate you getting up early after a late night watching that debate. So thank [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cUFxr951y4&t=345.52s)]
