# The GOP strategy for dealing with Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0)
*  Trump's also seizing on a proposal made by one of his 2024 primary opponents, Nikki Haley, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=0.0s)]
*  seemingly in an effort to one-up her. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=6.44s)]
*  After Haley called for mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over the age of 75 last [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=9.6s)]
*  week, Trump took things a step further yesterday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=15.6s)]
*  On social media, he called for both mental and physical fitness tests for all presidential [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=19.04s)]
*  candidates, writing, quote, being an outstanding president requires great mental acuity and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=23.84s)]
*  physical stamina. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=29.44s)]
*  If you don't have those qualities or traits, it is likely you won't succeed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=30.92s)]
*  It's unclear if Donald Trump has looked in a mirror recently. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=34.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans, with an eye on 2024, appear to be using different strategies when [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=37.24s)]
*  it comes to dealing with Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=41.84s)]
*  Here's what Haley said about the former president yesterday compared to what New Hampshire Governor [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=43.52s)]
*  Chris Nunu, another rumored 2024 candidate, what he had to say. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=48.52s)]
*  How do you beat Trump? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=54.6s)]
*  You know, I kick forward. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=57.44s)]
*  I'm not worried about Trump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=59.44s)]
*  This is about making sure we do something different and leave the status quo behind. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=61.0s)]
*  We can't keep losing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=64.78s)]
*  It is time that Americans know what it's like to win again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=66.64s)]
*  We have lost enough. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=70.3s)]
*  We've talked about bad past history issues enough. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Let's start focusing on getting our country back. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=75.62s)]
*  Let's get rid of socialism. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=78.12s)]
*  Let's get rid of this defeatism and let's show our kids what it means to love their [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=79.42s)]
*  country, a strong America, a proud America. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=83.4s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=86.12s)]
*  Look, my message to President about President Trump is we thank you for your service. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=88.84s)]
*  Great. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=92.56s)]
*  But we're moving on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=93.56s)]
*  Americans are not in the mode of just settling. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=94.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=96.8s)]
*  We're never going to say that the next the best opportunity for tomorrow's leadership [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=97.8s)]
*  is yesterday's leadership. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=100.56s)]
*  We want the next generation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=102.06s)]
*  We want the next big idea. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=103.06s)]
*  We want the next piece of technology. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=104.06s)]
*  And so it is in the American spirit to say we're going after the next thing and the next [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=105.56s)]
*  individual to lead our party and to lead this country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=109.24s)]
*  So it could be a variety of individuals. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=111.68s)]
*  I just former the former president is kind of baked in. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=113.12s)]
*  Either you're with him or you're not. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't think anything is going to get his poll numbers up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=118.36s)]
*  And as this race actually heats up and people start paying attention, there's just going [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=120.38s)]
*  to be a lot of other options on the table. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=123.3s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=126.1s)]
*  Julia, good to see you again. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=130.18s)]
*  Let's talk about those two very different approaches on display there from Haley and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=132.3s)]
*  Sununu. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  Republican strategists that you speak to who are expecting other candidates to jump in [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=138.01999999999998s)]
*  the race, whether that's DeSantis, Pompeo, Pence, the list goes on and on. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=143.3s)]
*  How do they think? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=147.64s)]
*  What do they think will be the most effective way of taking on Donald Trump? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=149.55999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to see you again, too, Jonathan. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  Look, I think going forward, a lot of Republican strategists are saying that they really need [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=155.64s)]
*  to hone in on this line of a new generation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=160.48s)]
*  You saw Sununu and you saw Haley mention it there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of that could be related to age or maybe even a change in policies. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=166.72s)]
*  However, I think it's mostly age because you hear Republican strategists and operatives [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  saying that Republican primary voters don't necessarily have a problem with Trump's policies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=176.62s)]
*  Trump's policies are very popular with those voters. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=183.02s)]
*  However, a lot of Republican primary voters, and you see this poll after poll, are really [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=186.62s)]
*  pushing for a new generation, sort of a new fresher face to lead the party. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=191.54s)]
*  And I think you are seeing a number of potential 2024 contenders really zero in on that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  And it's not just the 2024 contenders, Jonathan, that are talking about this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=201.34s)]
*  I thought it was remarkable to hear Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Arkansas governor, and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=205.5s)]
*  her State of the Union address while she praised Trump and her speech was very Trumpian. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=209.78s)]
*  She talked about the need for new young blood. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=214.82s)]
*  So I think the status quo or the I guess the modus operandi going forward for these 2024 [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=217.82s)]
*  contenders, according to these operatives, are tout Trump's policies, tout that America [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=223.66s)]
*  first policy platform, but talk about the need for a new generation, which basically [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=228.26s)]
*  means we like Trump's policies, but Trump himself should take a back seat at this point. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=234.5s)]
*  Yeah, we certainly know, though, that Trump has a loyal base of followers who likely aren't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=239.34s)]
*  going anywhere. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=243.66s)]
*  But there does seem to be a hunger, at least in parts, the party for, yes, a new voice. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=244.66s)]
*  So far, though, you know, you can't beat something with nothing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=249.62s)]
*  And the only candidate who's jumped in is Nikki Haley. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=252.26s)]
*  What's the early sense as to how the party leaders you've spoken to, as to how her rollout [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=255.06s)]
*  has gone? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=259.74s)]
*  I've heard really good things about her rollout. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=261.26s)]
*  And I think, you know, looking at her rollout, it was very well done. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=263.72s)]
*  And she has obviously an entire news cycle behind her. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=267.8s)]
*  She's been able to get out in front of the Ron DeSantis, the Mike Pence's, the Mike Pompeo's, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  the list goes on and get that news coverage for herself. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=277.70000000000005s)]
*  Additionally, you know, even though, you know, it was a controversial comment, you know, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=281.12s)]
*  a certain comment from another anchor on another network about her being past her prime. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=286.44000000000005s)]
*  I don't think that necessarily hurt her, because it's drawing a lot of attention to her and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  really drawing attention to the fact that she's the only woman, you know, potentially [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=297.41999999999996s)]
*  maybe South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem could jump in. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=301.7s)]
*  But it's drawing attention to that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=305.06s)]
*  And she's able to talk about that, to speak about that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=307.38s)]
*  So I think that's good in its own right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  And she's—look, in terms of chatting about what's happening on the ground, she had her [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=312.09999999999997s)]
*  rollout in a major swing—or early primary state, I should say, of South Carolina. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  And she's getting out to Iowa and New Hampshire early as an official candidate. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=322.38s)]
*  That being said, though, I think once the legislative session wraps in Florida, you're [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=327.54s)]
*  going to see Ron DeSantis start to jump in. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=331.74s)]
*  Tim Scott, another South Carolinian, very much leaning towards this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=334.3s)]
*  You know, other candidates, Mike Pence, are potential candidates making the rounds as [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  well. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  So it's not going to be the Nikki Haley show for much longer. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Haley got attention and fundraised off of that cable news comment. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=346.3s)]
*  The Hills, Julia Manchester, good work. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=351.7s)]
*  Thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=353.78s)]
*  Still ahead here. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGxomd2i8L0&t=355.62s)]
