# Trump admits he hasn't seen any evidence of cheating in the election
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls)
*  Now just two weeks for Election Day and we wanted the very best to join us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=0.0s)]
*  They weren't available. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=6.2s)]
*  So instead, managing editor at the Bullwark, Sam Stein is here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=7.2s)]
*  Sam, thanks for being here this morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=10.28s)]
*  Donald Trump yesterday raised some eyebrows. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=13.16s)]
*  Thank you, Sam. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=15.32s)]
*  We kid because we love. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=16.32s)]
*  Donald Trump yesterday in an appearance raised some eyebrows when he admitted that at least [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=17.32s)]
*  to this point he has not seen any evidence of voter fraud. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  But one wonders if he will perhaps change his tune in the next two weeks. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=27.88s)]
*  We certainly know he has laid the groundwork to claim that this election was rigged. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=31.82s)]
*  So what do you make of this sort of surprising admission yesterday? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=36.36s)]
*  I'm still stunned by that intro and hurt, frankly. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=40.6s)]
*  The admission, what do we think? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=45.36s)]
*  Do you think he's going to stick with this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=47.16s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't think he's going to stick with this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  The first sign of trouble, he'll say something fraudulent has happened. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't put any stock into this whatsoever. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=54.52s)]
*  One might call it a gaffe on his part because he's not supposed to say the truth in this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  case. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=63.84s)]
*  But I imagine that in a couple days, if not weeks, we'll be hearing a lot of fraud if [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=64.84s)]
*  that is it starts to look like the election is not going his way. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=68.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  It comes, I mean, even for Donald Trump's standards, the last few days have been just [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=73.16s)]
*  stunning in their scattershot nature, whether it's McDonald's. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  What gave it away? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=83.2s)]
*  The Arnold Palmer comments? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  Was that something that gave it away? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=86.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was my tip off. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=88.12s)]
*  Let's just get a read on this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=91.4s)]
*  I mean, I know he's Donald Trump, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  And his team, his campaign is pushing back against reporting and claims from the vice [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  president's team that Trump is exhausted, that he's having a hard, they're canceling [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=98.92s)]
*  interviews, he's having a hard time focusing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  He's apparently looked like there's clipped he's falling asleep at an event. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Is this the pressure? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=109.48s)]
*  Give us just a sense of from your team's reporting. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=111.04s)]
*  Where do things stand right now in Trump world? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=114.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=115.24s)]
*  So we did a story. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=116.24s)]
*  So Mark Caputo for the Bulwark did a story on this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=117.24s)]
*  And the truth of the matter is, it's twofold. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=119.0s)]
*  One is, of course he's exhausted, right? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=121.36s)]
*  He's 78 years old. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=123.28s)]
*  He's keeping a really insane schedule. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=125.04s)]
*  He's going all over the country and not just battlegrounds days. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=128.28s)]
*  Remember, he went to Coachella. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=131.36s)]
*  He said to go to Madison Square Garden. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=132.36s)]
*  He's also up at odd hours because he's addicted to his phone and he likes to post and he watches [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=136.24s)]
*  a lot of TV. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=143.48s)]
*  You know, so he's not he's not like the pinnacle of self care. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=144.48s)]
*  Let's put it that way. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=148.92s)]
*  So yes, he's exhausted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=150.04s)]
*  But frankly, like he should be exhausted. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm exhausted. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=154.12s)]
*  You're probably exhausted, too. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=155.12s)]
*  Like that's just how it works. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Does that suggest serious cognitive decline? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=158.2s)]
*  No, not necessarily. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=161.0s)]
*  But I will say, and people who have been around him and have observed him have said, you know, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=163.04s)]
*  he's not as sharp as he was. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=168.12s)]
*  You look at any clip from 2016 to 2024 and it's clear what the differences are. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  He's 78 years old. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  He's old. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=176.8s)]
*  This is what happens. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=177.8s)]
*  This is the exact criticism that Biden had to face. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=178.8s)]
*  It's something that Trump has to face. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=181.56s)]
*  I think it's been exacerbated by the fact that he's on the trail in this critical moment [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=182.96s)]
*  and he's getting no sleep. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=187.08s)]
*  And the entire staff around him feels similarly about this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=188.58s)]
*  They can't sleep either because if they were to sleep on the plane, it would be a sign [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=190.94s)]
*  of weakness in Trump world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=194.68s)]
*  Yeah, Sam, first of all, I am definitely exhausted. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm exhausted. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=199.28s)]
*  When Rudy Giuliani fell asleep on the plane in 2016, many people would have cost him a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=200.28s)]
*  cabinet position. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=204.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=205.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=206.12s)]
*  He can't do it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=207.12s)]
*  He can't do it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=208.12s)]
*  And Trump has been indeed posting on Truth Social at 1, 2, 3 in the morning sometimes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=209.12s)]
*  I think another thing that maybe has been overlooked here is perhaps some pressure on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=212.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=215.04s)]
*  And just a couple of weeks after the election, he's facing a criminal sentencing. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=216.04s)]
*  And he also knows that if he loses, some of the federal cases against him could be revived. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=220.52s)]
*  But I'm curious, Sam, when Vice President Harris took over the top of the ticket, they [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=225.16s)]
*  was a real emphasis like it's going to be, ah, the prosecutor versus the con. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=229.28s)]
*  And that lasted for a few weeks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=233.84s)]
*  Maybe for that first debate. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=235.12s)]
*  That argument has completely vanished. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=236.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=238.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=239.4s)]
*  Well, I think for starters, she and her team looked at the data and were like, OK, the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=240.4s)]
*  undecided voters, the people who are on the fence, they don't know enough about her. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=246.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=250.4s)]
*  Even though she's been vice president, if you look at any of these focus groups, the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=251.4s)]
*  main critique was, what has she done? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=253.84s)]
*  Like where has she been? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  I barely hear about her. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=256.92s)]
*  And so they spent a lot of time and money, frankly, going out to the public and trying [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=258.64000000000004s)]
*  to introduce her on a biographical level. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=263.0s)]
*  Now, some of that was, look, she used to be a prosecutor and they used that prosecutor [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=265.0s)]
*  line to also talk about the border. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=271.76000000000005s)]
*  Like one of the things that they said about the border was not just that the bill that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=272.76000000000005s)]
*  the Senate had considered for border security was nixed because of Trump, but that Harris [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=276.24s)]
*  herself has prosecuted immigration cases. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  Now you're starting to see it's actually coming back a little bit more. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=282.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  The introduction has been heavy contrast with Trump, looking at the threats from within [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=286.92s)]
*  line that he's been leveled, been leveling, I should say. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=291.12s)]
*  And then going back to the idea that this guy is a unique threat to democracy, a potential [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  autocrat, his own former chief of staff, sorry, joint chief of staff, head of joint chief [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  of staff said he's fascist to the core. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=305.92s)]
*  In that genre, in that vein, she has positioned herself as someone who believes in law enforcement, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=308.12s)]
*  who in fact was part of law enforcement. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=312.92s)]
*  But yeah, I'm with you on this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=315.56s)]
*  It kind of dropped from the public conscience for a little bit coming back now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=316.72s)]
*  And Sam, you know, that idea that Trump is a threat to democracy, polls suggest that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=322.16s)]
*  particularly resonates with older voters who are more familiar with the Cold War mindset [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  or even some of them remember the aftermath of World War II. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=331.04s)]
*  Older voters also, people in the White House think that that's a place where the prescription [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=334.04s)]
*  drug price controls they put in place could really help with them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you see perhaps a closing argument there where Harris is going to focus on those voters [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=342.12s)]
*  to try to put her over the edge? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=345.6s)]
*  Well, John, I would be very curious. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=346.6s)]
*  Maybe you could report this out if Joe Biden's sitting there smiling a little bit, right? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=349.08s)]
*  Like this was his bread and butter. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=353.0s)]
*  You remember he launched his reelection campaign at Valley Forge. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=355.12s)]
*  This was the speech that he gave. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  And people for a while were like, well, this is sort of, no one really cares about this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=360.92s)]
*  stuff. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=364.48s)]
*  It's really not going to move the dial. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=365.48s)]
*  Like you need to talk about domestic issues and inflation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=366.48s)]
*  And yeah, Harris has talked about those too. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=369.6s)]
*  But to close on this, this is a very Biden-esque close, I will say. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=372.08s)]
*  I do think, to your point, it resonates with older voters. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=375.72s)]
*  It also resonates with the Cheney types, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=379.84s)]
*  And she's making, Harris is making a very clear, aggressive play for that swath of the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=381.88s)]
*  electorate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=386.76s)]
*  And that's why you see this so heavily emphasized down the end stretch here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=387.76s)]
*  And I suspect we'll hear from President Biden when he travels both through Hampshire and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=390.68s)]
*  Arizona this week. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8UwnP207ls&t=393.6s)]
