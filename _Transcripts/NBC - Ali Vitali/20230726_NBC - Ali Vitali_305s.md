# DeSantis campaign fires more staff amid restructuring
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA)
*  Ron DeSantis's presidential campaign is cutting even more staff as his team hopes a massive restructuring can right the Florida governor's struggling primary bid. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=0.0s)]
*  38 workers now that's more than 40% of DeSantis's original staff have been fired since the campaign launched just back in May. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=8.64s)]
*  The move comes amid concerns the campaign is spending too much too fast. This as the governor's chief financial officer is also leaving the campaign. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=16.36s)]
*  Now one of the staffers who was just let go was a man named Nate Hockman. He came under fire over the weekend for retweeting a video that included Nazi imagery. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=24.6s)]
*  DeSantis campaign official did not specify if the video factored into his firing. We can probably take a guess. Hockman did not respond to a request for comment. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now congressional reporter for Axios Sophia Kai and she's here to talk about all of this politics. Sophia great to see you. Let's start with let's start with the DeSantis turmoil here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=43.720000000000006s)]
*  There's been it's been a pretty unrelenting stream of headlines in recent days about DeSantis reshuffling or firing or bad money. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=55.440000000000005s)]
*  That's not the momentum any campaign wants. Take us under the hood here. How worried are they that they need to turn things around and do it quickly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=64.16s)]
*  I mean I think they are extremely worried in the first place. You know it's really over confidence that you're hiring so much and spending so much money now or six months out. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=72.28s)]
*  From the six from the first votes being cast in Iowa and they're doing this massive overhaul. I mean we're talking about 40 percent of the campaign staff. You know he's trying to do [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=81.6s)]
*  smaller events. He's trying to be a be a little bit more cordial with press and mainstream press. I mean those are big changes for a campaign that up until you know a couple of months ago has been very Florida based. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=91.4s)]
*  And there's there's so many worrying signs right. Some big donors have already maxed out. They've had trouble getting grassroots donations. The staff turnover we just mentioned. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  And then he's seemingly putting a lot of bet a pretty big bet on Iowa which is a state that's never actually been the kindest to Trump. Right. So I would seem to make a place where you can make your inroads. But his poll numbers there have been slipping. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=114.88s)]
*  I mean he either needs to do really well in Iowa or come in a very good second place or you know he might have to find an offer for himself. I mean it's it's the one state that Trump did not win last time around. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=126.52s)]
*  You know it's a caucus state. And so DeSantis really has to make a big showing to show that he has made these changes. He's made that effective. And when one more before we turn to Kevin McCarthy but one more on DeSantis we we are expecting as we talk to the top of the show the next federal indictment of Donald Trump could come as early as tomorrow but surely it's expected in the next couple of weeks. I think that's safe to say. How is the DeSantis team preparing to react to that. What's their play going to be when that comes down. You know I don't know if it will be any [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=139.44s)]
*  different than how they've reacted for the first two indictments. I mean we did not see these Republican candidates come out strong to you know stand behind the indictment. You know they're most likely going to say that this is a weaponized Justice Department. You know it's the same line that they've been using and it's mainly because they're running to be more like Trump. They will likely be defending him when the indictment comes out. Yeah. And I know you were just in Iowa so you've been getting a firsthand look at these candidates. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=169.44s)]
*  On the ground. But we want to turn out lastly to Speaker McCarthy in those comments just now. An impeachment inquiry is still in itself a significant thing. It could lead to impeachment. There is some theorizing of folks that I was talking to yesterday on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue that maybe an impeachment inquiry would be enough. McCarthy he gives that out there that be enough to satisfy the far right members of his caucus who want Trump. I mean they who want Biden impeached himself. What's your read of how this could play out in the weeks ahead. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=199.44s)]
*  I mean look they've been talking about impeaching a lot of people but now it seems like they've zoomed in on President Biden himself. But McCarthy has a pretty fine line to walk here right. He's facing demands from these more extreme Freedom Caucus members. But at the same time he's got to also worry about the moderates. I mean he only has a five vote majority. So he's got to walk this fine line between kind of hinting at it. You know stepping his toe right there but not actually following through. And that's really [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=229.44s)]
*  that's really the key here. You know yesterday you just played the video of Speaker McCarthy walking back the comments a little bit that he made to Fox News about the impeachment. And that's certainly I think both parties would agree that if impeachment became a common political tool that would be bad for our nation's democracy. We of course will stay on this in the weeks ahead. Congressional reporter for Axios Sophia Khay. Great to see you this morning. Thanks for being here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=259.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U72Q5Q39nZA&t=289.44s)]
