# GOP debate stage shrinks to four candidates
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI)
*  And then there were four. Tomorrow night, four Republican candidates will take the stage in Tuscaloosa, Alabama for the fourth GOP primary debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=0.0s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, and Vivek Ramaswamy all made the cut, meeting the RNC's requirements of 1,000 unique donors, while also polling at least 6% in two national polls. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=11.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is once again skipping the debate. Instead, he will hold a private fundraiser down in Florida. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=26.0s)]
*  North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, he also won't be there, but for very different reasons. Burgum suspended his presidential campaign yesterday. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=35.0s)]
*  After failing to gain traction in the crowded field, he wouldn't have qualified for the debate, so he has now dropped out. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=43.0s)]
*  Joining us now, national political correspondent for Axios, Alex Thompson. Alex, I won't get you to deliver us a political obituary for the Burgum campaign, since it would be very, very, very brief. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=49.0s)]
*  So instead, let's talk about the debate tomorrow night. What are you looking out for? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=61.0s)]
*  I'm looking out for a brawl. I mean, and that isn't just strategic, but it's also sort of out of desperation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=66.0s)]
*  You know, as you pointed out, Donald Trump is skipping this debate, which essentially makes it, you know, a silver medal debate, undercard debate, choose whichever second place metaphor that you want. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=72.0s)]
*  And essentially that means that one candidate, that every single candidate on that stage wants to essentially become the second place, the Trump alternative. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=83.0s)]
*  And as a result, I think you are going to see them all sort of climbing over each other. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=96.0s)]
*  I think in particular, you should really look out for Nikki Haley and Rhonda Santis, who at least so far in polling show that they are the most likely to be that Trump alternative candidate. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=102.0s)]
*  Rhonda Santis has basically seen his polling decline ever since he has gotten into the race. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=112.0s)]
*  That being said, he still has a substantial part of that of that base going into Iowa. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=118.0s)]
*  He's also now said that he plans to win the Iowa caucus and is betting it all on there while Nikki Haley has basically been in the opposite direction. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=124.0s)]
*  She has been starting to climb. So if Rhonda Santis has any hope of sort of preserving the two man race that he framed this entire candidacy around, he has to stop Nikki Haley's rise. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=133.0s)]
*  So clearly Haley and DeSantis will be the center of attention tomorrow night. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=145.0s)]
*  They have the most credibility in terms of being coming that Trump alternative as far back in the polls as they are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=150.0s)]
*  So talk to us about that dynamic or either campaign previewing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=156.0s)]
*  Are they going to really go hard after the other? Is DeSantis going to go after Haley, Haley after DeSantis? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=160.0s)]
*  Because it seems like the only shot anyone has of stopping Trump is if they all consolidate over around one of those two. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=164.0s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, the previewing has been really interesting. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=172.0s)]
*  Rhonda Santis certainly has been previewing actually a flurry of attacks over the last three or four weeks as it became clear that Nikki Haley was a big problem. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=175.0s)]
*  You've also seen him dump a ton of money on television in Iowa to try to blunt her rise. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=184.0s)]
*  Interestingly, though, Nikki Haley is basically tried to deflect all of his attacks and not sort of get in the mud. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=190.0s)]
*  Basically, she is dismissed all the attacks as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=197.0s)]
*  This is what you do when you're losing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=200.0s)]
*  I expect that Nikki Haley will try to sort of rise above it and try to deflect those attacks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=202.0s)]
*  Now, you should also expect the attacks won't just be coming from Rhonda Santis. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=208.0s)]
*  I would also expect Chris Christie to to maybe lean in on her given that they're basically neck and neck in New Hampshire. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=213.0s)]
*  And you can always bet that Vivek Rameswamy and Nikki Haley are going to go at it in terms of that consolidation that you talked about. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=219.0s)]
*  The really interesting thing to watch, and I think is a little bit underappreciated, is that there is a month gap between the January 23rd New Hampshire primary and the February 24th Republican South Carolina primary. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=226.0s)]
*  So essentially, if the field can consolidate right after New Hampshire and make it a one on one race, that is the best chance anyone would have, even if they'd be a severe underdog at taking Donald Trump on one on one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=239.0s)]
*  That's a really good point about the calendar there, Alex. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=251.0s)]
*  So on that, is there an expectation there will be another one of these debates? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=255.0s)]
*  Or do we think tomorrow night will be it? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=260.0s)]
*  Well, we don't know, which is, again, why I think you're going to see a little bit of desperation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=262.0s)]
*  The RNC has been incredibly noncommittal, notably noncommittal, about hosting a debate before Iowa and before New Hampshire. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=266.0s)]
*  Those were originally expected. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=275.0s)]
*  Certainly ABC News and other outlets are pitching themselves to do it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=277.0s)]
*  But we actually don't know if there will be another debate. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=282.0s)]
*  Chris Christie barely squeaked in this one. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=286.0s)]
*  It'd be unclear if he would actually squeak in the next one. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=288.0s)]
*  So this is also, I think, adding a lot of urgency to these candidates as they go in this sort of civil metal debate. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=291.0s)]
*  I think there's some hope among Republicans. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=298.0s)]
*  If the field does narrow to two, the Trump might be forced to debate that other person, but his campaign still sowing no signs of that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=299.0s)]
*  They're clearly already moving towards the general election. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=306.0s)]
*  We shall keep an eye on it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=309.0s)]
*  Of course, we'll have complete coverage here tomorrow of that debate. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=310.0s)]
*  National political correspondent for Axios, Alex Thompson, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAr0rXGyarI&t=313.0s)]
