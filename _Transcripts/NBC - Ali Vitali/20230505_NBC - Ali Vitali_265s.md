# White House weighing debt ceiling fallback options
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM)
*  We'll begin with a scramble to avoid a first-ever government default. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=0.0s)]
*  With the clock ticking, both Republicans and Democrats are still refusing to budge when [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=5.68s)]
*  it comes to debt-stealing negotiations. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=10.82s)]
*  According to some new reporting in the Wall Street Journal, the White House is weighing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=13.68s)]
*  potential fallback options. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=17.56s)]
*  People familiar with the matter tell the newspaper that administration officials and lawmakers [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=20.04s)]
*  are considering alternatives, like a short-term increase in the borrowing limit that would [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=24.6s)]
*  buy them time to find some sort of compromise. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=30.44s)]
*  Those same people said administration officials are also taking a fresh look at experimental [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  ways that the U.S. could potentially keep paying the government's bills even if Congress [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=41.22s)]
*  doesn't raise the debt limit. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=46.14s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the United States could default as early [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=48.24s)]
*  as June 1st, which of course is less than a month away. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=52.76s)]
*  Joining us now, co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  She is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=60.44s)]
*  Great to see you, as always, my friend. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=62.68s)]
*  So, first let's talk about some of these outside-the-box options that the White House is considering. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=64.48s)]
*  Their public rhetoric has always been, hey, this is Congress's job, you've got to get [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=69.44s)]
*  this done. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=72.28s)]
*  What are some of the alternatives you're looking at? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=73.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think this is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=75.72s)]
*  We're going to have the first meeting between Biden and the leaders of Congress next week. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=79.92s)]
*  But certainly, they're trying to see, is there any fallback options, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=86.64s)]
*  So far, both camps have really stuck to their kind of negotiating positions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=90.64s)]
*  And the question is going to be, will the Biden administration budge at all when it [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=96.12s)]
*  comes to spending cuts? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  Will it try to negotiate with Kevin McCarthy? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=101.28s)]
*  So far, I think what we're really seeing is a White House who doesn't understand how to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  negotiate with Republicans, which is why we're seeing this new reporting on saying, okay, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=107.16s)]
*  well, if we can't figure it out with McCarthy, what are we going to do? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=111.32s)]
*  Some of that is questioning, okay, are we going to be able to try to just pay our debt [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=114.8s)]
*  no matter what? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=119.08s)]
*  And that would clearly trigger a lawsuit immediately. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=120.08s)]
*  So this administration doesn't have a lot of good options, Jonathan, when it comes to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=123.44s)]
*  not trying to find a way forward with Republicans. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=127.94s)]
*  I guess the counter there is they're saying, well, we will negotiate with Republicans, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=131.68s)]
*  but we'll do so on the budget. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=135.2s)]
*  The debt ceiling should be a separate matter. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=136.88s)]
*  And that's why it seems like these two parties are just they're just talking past each other. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=139.0s)]
*  They can't even agree on the basic premise of this meeting. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=141.88s)]
*  So let's go there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=145.52s)]
*  I mean, what are the expectations for this White House meeting next week, Tuesday, with [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=146.52s)]
*  all the big four congressional leaders and the president? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=151.88s)]
*  Do we have any any hope at all of some sort of breakthrough? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=154.72s)]
*  Hard to see these kinds of meetings actually having a massive deal and everybody coming [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=157.92s)]
*  out to the cameras and saying, all right, we fix this problem. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=162.84s)]
*  Congress, as you well know, doesn't move until it absolutely has to. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=167.52s)]
*  But it is, I think, a significant step forward. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  I think the real question is, can they say, all right, we're going to do this debt limit, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=174.24s)]
*  that's going to be clean. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=177.56s)]
*  We have the September government funding fight that's going to happen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=178.56s)]
*  Maybe they start some negotiations there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, Kevin McCarthy has not drawn a lot of red lines, which I think in the just kind [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=184.12s)]
*  of the negotiating world is a good sign for trying to find a way forward. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=188.76s)]
*  The Republicans are very well aware that if there is a default on the debt, that they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  will likely be blamed by the public for it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=198.2s)]
*  And so the question is, is there something to be done on permitting reform? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  Is there something something on the overall spending limits and budget caps to be done? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  I think those are going to be the three things to be watching in the next week or so. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=209.32s)]
*  Is there any movement there? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=213.56s)]
*  Just continue to kind of stay in their hardline places. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=216.16s)]
*  Then things get a little bit more dicey, I think, as we get closer to this deadline that's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=219.24s)]
*  in less than a month. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=223.48s)]
*  Yeah, the White House is convinced, at least at this moment, the politics of the issue [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=224.48s)]
*  is on their side. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=228.64s)]
*  That said, if we do default, everyone's going to take the blame. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=229.88s)]
*  And certainly Americans themselves will feel the worst of it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=233.44s)]
*  We'll be talking to you a lot in the weeks ahead about this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=236.92s)]
*  Thank you for starting us off today. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer, will be looking for the newsletter in our [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=240.44s)]
*  inboxes shortly. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyjsuOWaGlM&t=243.32s)]
