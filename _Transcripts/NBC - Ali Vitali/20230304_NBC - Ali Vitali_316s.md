# 2024 GOP candidates largely avoid discussing Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U)
*  If that standard bearer is the former president, if he is the nominee, would you support him? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I think we'll have better choices, and I really trust Republican voters to sort it [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  out. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=13.08s)]
*  Again, I'm very proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=14.08s)]
*  I think no one could have defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 other than Donald Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=18.76s)]
*  But I think different times call for different leadership. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=23.8s)]
*  That's not a yes in terms of supporting Trump if he's the nominee. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=26.78s)]
*  I'm very confident we'll have better choices come 2024, and I'm confident our standard [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  bearer will win the day in November of that year. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=36.86s)]
*  Former Vice President Mike Pence once again dodging the question of whether he'll support [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=41.58s)]
*  his former boss in 2024 if Trump were to be the GOP nominee. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=45.22s)]
*  In that interview, Pence said he'll make a decision about his own presidential campaign [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=49.66s)]
*  by the spring. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=54.5s)]
*  Joining us now, former aide to the George W. Bush White House and State Departments [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  Elise Jordan. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=60.54s)]
*  She is an MSNBC political analyst as well. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=61.54s)]
*  We're always happy when she joins us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=63.9s)]
*  So Elise, let's talk about Trump, which we have to do because he's still hovering over [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  this Republican field. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=71.02s)]
*  We were seeing it play out at CPAC this week, it diminished CPAC to be sure, but he's still [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=73.02s)]
*  the heavyweight there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=76.9s)]
*  How do you think the other candidates have done so far in terms of dealing with the Trump [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=79.14s)]
*  question? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=83.82s)]
*  Some are ignoring it, some are taking head on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=84.82s)]
*  Someone like DeSantis seems to not want to suggest that Donald Trump even exists. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=86.77999999999999s)]
*  Well, the other candidates don't want Trump to lay a glove on them, and they haven't been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=91.41999999999999s)]
*  that successful because how are they going to avoid attacking the elephant in the room? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=98.33999999999999s)]
*  Trump still looms large in that he leads with Republican voters, all the primary voters [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=103.78s)]
*  that they need if they're going to win. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  I would give Trump probably a 60-40 heads up against DeSantis at this stage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=110.86s)]
*  And then you look at how those numbers cut in the polling, and Donald Trump would probably [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=117.3s)]
*  still maintain the DeSantis voters are going, he's not going, meaning even if DeSantis got [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  the nomination, would those Trump voters come over to DeSantis? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=129.9s)]
*  And as of now, we don't know that they actually would. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=134.58s)]
*  So you see a lot of Republican candidates trying to dance around Trump the person, and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=137.74s)]
*  they'll praise his policies, but he is still the contender to beat, and I don't see that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=143.46s)]
*  changing in the near future. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=150.26000000000002s)]
*  So Elise, you worked in a White House. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=152.22s)]
*  You know what those environments are like. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  And what's tricky about this dynamic is some of the potential challenges that Trump all [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=155.74s)]
*  used to work for him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=160.26000000000002s)]
*  We, of course, just played Mike Pence. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  Mike Pompeo was his former Secretary of State. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=163.22s)]
*  Nikki Haley is former ambassador to the UN. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=165.66000000000003s)]
*  Haley expected to speak at CPAC today. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=167.54s)]
*  She's one of the few challengers who is going to go. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=170.42s)]
*  So what kind of advice, if you will, would you give those candidates to how to differentiate [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=173.06s)]
*  themselves from a man they used to work for? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  They are all very smart, strong politicians. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=181.38s)]
*  I hesitate to give anyone advice on how to take on Trump, just because you look at what [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=185.22s)]
*  happens to everyone who does. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=190.66s)]
*  And if anything, I would say differentiate themselves by being bolder and by attacking [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=193.22s)]
*  him and making fun of him more directly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  But you are going to see anyone do that because that's how you get crushed going up against [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=200.34s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=205.38s)]
*  And they dance around him, and the idea Mike Pence was heralding civility and said, oh, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=206.38s)]
*  his policies are great, but you know, voters really want to return to character and civility. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=212.18s)]
*  And that's actually true. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=216.78s)]
*  It hasn't seemed to diminish Trump's poll numbers that much, given that his supporters [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=219.06s)]
*  were running around on January 6 saying, hang Mike Pence. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=226.5s)]
*  Amusingly, Donald Trump took on this show yesterday, but it was on Truth Social, so [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=230.26s)]
*  you probably missed it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=235.06s)]
*  Badge of honor, I suppose. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=241.22s)]
*  At least lastly, let's just talk about the legal peril that's surrounding Donald Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=242.22s)]
*  Or something to happen, and maybe happen soon. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=248.22s)]
*  We heard this from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie predicting it yesterday. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=250.17999999999998s)]
*  Do you think that actually would help or hurt his political chances? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  I think it's going to depend on what kind of legal trouble it is. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=254.94s)]
*  I think that the classified documents had a lot of potential for him to be in hot water. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  But then when you see other politicians, such as the former vice presidents, rather, Pence [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  and Biden, you see how they have a very similar low grade scandal of the same sort. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=273.34s)]
*  And it's just going to become conflated to voters. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=280.7s)]
*  So I really think that that one is a bit of a wash when it did originally coming out of [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=282.78s)]
*  the gates. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=287.62s)]
*  It was supposed to have a lot of impact. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=288.62s)]
*  Elise Jordan, thank you as always. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=291.9s)]
*  Have a good weekend, my friend. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=294.29999999999995s)]
*  Up next here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKa2KAKi0U&t=295.65999999999997s)]
