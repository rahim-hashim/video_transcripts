# Johnson picks Rep. Rick Crawford as next Intel Chair
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson has selected Republican Congressman Rick Crawford of Arkansas to serve [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=0.0s)]
*  as the next chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=5.28s)]
*  Johnson made the announcement yesterday, just one day after ousting Republican Congressman [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=8.18s)]
*  Mike Turner from the role. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=11.82s)]
*  Speaking to reporters, Johnson denied replacing Turner because of pressure from Trump or his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=13.68s)]
*  allies. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=17.84s)]
*  This is not a President Trump decision. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=18.84s)]
*  This is a House decision and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=22.84s)]
*  He did a great job. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=30.28s)]
*  But we just, the intelligence community and everything related to HIPC, it needs a fresh [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=32.16s)]
*  start and that's what this is about. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  But Turner himself told CBS News yesterday that Speaker Johnson, when firing him, said [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=41.68s)]
*  he was doing so because of quote, concerns from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now, Washington correspondent for The Economist, Adam O'Neill. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=50.0s)]
*  Adam, let's just first start right there because the Speaker's office, my sources there have [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=53.52s)]
*  said we could have done this when we first got into the Speaker's office. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  We let him finish out the rest of the Congress. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  There are concerns here over the way that he acted over privacy provisions that were [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=64.2s)]
*  being voted on last Congress. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=69.12s)]
*  Can you just walk us through this a little bit? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=70.44s)]
*  It's pretty surprising. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=73.12s)]
*  It's a classic Washington statement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=74.42s)]
*  He's doing a great job. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=76.56s)]
*  No offense, I just fired him, right? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=78.0s)]
*  You can't just say what's really going on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=79.52s)]
*  But you have to look at where the conflicts were, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=81.52s)]
*  Johnson will say one thing, Turner will say another. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=84.64s)]
*  But it's very clear that the House Freedom Caucus, the hardline faction, was not happy [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=87.72s)]
*  with him, particularly over a controversial renewal of a surveillance program last year. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=92.06s)]
*  He's also perceived as being more hawkish. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=97.12s)]
*  He voted for Ukraine aid. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=99.0s)]
*  And that's not entirely out of step with Donald Trump, who's been kind of ambivalent about [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=100.88s)]
*  Ukraine we've seen. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  But it's very clear that some people were unhappy with Turner, and apparently now Mike [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=105.8s)]
*  Johnson is too. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  And I haven't heard any specific reporting about exactly what was there, and it may turn [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  into just being a he said, she said. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=115.64s)]
*  But when you look at the context of this, it's quite clear that the right thinks that they've [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  won this one, although that's not necessarily the end of it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it also might be both, right, where the speaker has the right to put in place [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  his own people. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=128.72s)]
*  And also, there could be a reason from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=129.8s)]
*  This privacy and surveillance program is going to be the topic of a lot of conversation, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=132.38s)]
*  especially when we get to Tulsi Gatwood's confirmation hearing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  But I digress. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=139.1s)]
*  I think the Turner thing is really important to the piece that you just wrote in The Economist [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=140.1s)]
*  about the way that Republicans in Congress could be the very thing standing in the way [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=144.78s)]
*  of Donald Trump's ultimate success. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=150.06s)]
*  We've got from our Hill team members of Congress saying, Mike Turner now has a reason to vote [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=152.06s)]
*  no on everything. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=155.66s)]
*  That would throw this into flux, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=156.66s)]
*  I think that after Donald Trump won such a convincing victory, popular vote, electoral [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=159.42s)]
*  college, your viewers know this, are very informed people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=163.78s)]
*  He was seen as almost bulletproof. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=167.77999999999997s)]
*  He could do anything. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=169.77999999999997s)]
*  He had total control of the GOP. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=170.77999999999997s)]
*  And superficially, that's true. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=172.42s)]
*  Very few people want to come out in the same way that John McCain did eight years ago and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=174.01999999999998s)]
*  make clear their disdain for Donald Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=178.82s)]
*  But despite that superficial support, you can see throughout tons of legislative battles [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=181.06s)]
*  that there are a lot of people who they'll say, I love Donald Trump, which is why I'm [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=187.74s)]
*  opposing Donald Trump on this particular issue. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=191.18s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=193.46s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=194.46s)]
*  In your new piece, you also mentioned the Senate confirmation hearings this week for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=195.46s)]
*  several of Trump's cabinet picks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=197.58s)]
*  What's your reaction to what we've seen so far? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=199.94s)]
*  And when you talk about the way that someone doesn't want to be the John McCain, the person [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=202.26s)]
*  I'm now thinking of is, does Mitch McConnell want to play that role when it comes to some [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=206.14s)]
*  of these confirmation battles? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=209.66s)]
*  Or does it not really matter since everyone else seems to be falling in line? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=211.34s)]
*  Well, you need four Republicans to break, assuming all Democrats unite. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=214.78s)]
*  And when it comes to someone like RFK and you might peel off some Democrats, you might [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  need five. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=222.78s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=223.78s)]
*  That said, McConnell is one of them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=224.78s)]
*  You also have Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, who the last time around were happy to vote [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=226.02s)]
*  against Trump when they had to here and there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=230.34s)]
*  I think an interesting one that people have kind of slept on a little bit is John Cornyn, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=232.34s)]
*  who people, many people are saying his office hasn't clarified one way or the other, but [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  I've been hearing that he may be on his way out and with nothing left to lose and his [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=241.74s)]
*  certain his beliefs that he holds very firmly when they contradict with Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=245.74s)]
*  It'd be a lot easier if you're not worried about a primary two years from now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  Cornyn is an interesting name. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  I thought you were going to go with a different John, which is Curtis from Utah, because he [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=254.18s)]
*  seemed to be making a little bit of this noise initially, too. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  He's come around on Hegseth, but maybe he's an interesting one to watch. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=260.94s)]
*  Curtis is sort of filling that Romney gap. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=264.54s)]
*  I mean, he replaced his seat, but also he comes from that wing of the party. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=267.02s)]
*  Utah Republicans and their relationship with Donald Trump. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=271.22s)]
*  We could do a whole segment about that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=273.94s)]
*  And when you have it also, it's issue by issue, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=275.66s)]
*  Because there are plenty of issues. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=278.74s)]
*  I think generally speaking, tax cuts, immigration, energy, they agree with Donald Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=280.22s)]
*  It's when you get into the weeds, will they say, well, this particular provision of the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  tax bill, I don't like even if Trump does. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=288.82s)]
*  And that's where the differences come out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=290.7s)]
*  Yeah. But the weeds are really important, especially when you're putting together massive [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=291.98s)]
*  legislation like they want to put together. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=295.02s)]
*  Adam O'Neill, thank you so much for getting up with us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=296.98s)]
*  We're going to be looking for your revealing piece online right now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XptxGKO36Qw&t=299.3s)]
