# Speaker Johnson says stand-alone Israel aid bill to be considered this week
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk)
*  New House Speaker Mike Johnson says aid to Israel will be considered on the House floor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=0.0s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=5.84s)]
*  The catch? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=6.84s)]
*  It will be a standalone measure. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=7.84s)]
*  That's despite President Biden's call for Congress to provide a broader package that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=10.28s)]
*  also includes aid to Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=14.64s)]
*  During an interview yesterday with Fox News, Speaker Johnson expressed confidence that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=17.76s)]
*  the standalone measure would pass. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=22.28s)]
*  There are lots of things going on around the world that we have to address and we will. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=25.76s)]
*  But right now what's happening in Israel takes the immediate attention and I think we've [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=30.360000000000003s)]
*  got to separate that and get it through. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=34.24s)]
*  I believe there will be bipartisan support for that and I'm going to push very hard for [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  Do you believe there will be bipartisan support in the Senate? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  Will it pass muster there? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=42.78s)]
*  I think it will. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=46.24s)]
*  My intention is not to use this for any partisan political gamesmanship. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=47.44s)]
*  This is a very serious matter. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=52.1s)]
*  Earlier this month, the White House asked Congress to provide more than $105 billion [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=55.16s)]
*  in aid to Ukraine and Israel as well as some other national security needs. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=60.16s)]
*  Before he was elected Speaker, then just Congressman Johnson, voted last month with 93 other Republicans [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=65.6s)]
*  to cut off aid to Ukraine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=71.52s)]
*  But during an interview he did on Fox the day after he was sworn in, Johnson did emphasize [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=74.32s)]
*  the U.S. must stop Russia's advances. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  So joining us now to help make sense of it, co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=82.4s)]
*  She is also an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=86.84s)]
*  Anna good to see you this morning. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=90.04s)]
*  So let's talk about the Speaker's proposal that he floated this weekend on television [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=91.2s)]
*  there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  A standalone aid measure for Israel. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  What are you and your colleagues learning about what it will look like, how much money, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=99.48s)]
*  and what's the timing? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  I think it reflects a broader feeling within certainly House Republicans, but that they [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=105.48s)]
*  don't want to just jam a bunch of different issues that they feel are actually separate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=111.0s)]
*  and put them together into these kind of larger packages, which we have historically seen [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  Congress do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  I think the biggest thing to watch here, though, is the fact that not even that he's just separating [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  out the Israel funding, but that Speaker Johnson wants to have this emergency funding offset. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=125.08s)]
*  That's basically unheard of. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=131.4s)]
*  So they're going to try to find some kinds of cuts. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=132.68s)]
*  We don't have any indication yet what those cuts would look like. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=134.72s)]
*  But that's a real effort in terms of to kind of increase the number of Republicans who [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=138.67999999999998s)]
*  would be willing to support this package. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=143.0s)]
*  And then it goes to the Senate where you have a very different viewpoint, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=145.32s)]
*  Where you have Mitch McConnell and others saying, actually, no, we should be twinning [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=148.44s)]
*  these issues, the Ukraine funding as well as the Israel funding. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=151.32s)]
*  So Anna, we heard from Matt Gaetz last week talk about how pushing out Speaker McCarthy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=155.6s)]
*  was worth it because they now have a more MAGA friendly speaker now in Johnson. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=161.64s)]
*  We've been into it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=165.76s)]
*  Never lose sight of the fact that he voted to he was a leader in the effort to decertify [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=166.76s)]
*  Joe Biden's win. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=171.72s)]
*  How do we think that's going to play out? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=173.56s)]
*  And is there any sense that the motion to vacate, which now just needs one person to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=175.12s)]
*  trigger it, could change? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, there is an effort underway to try and change the motion to vacate, to have it be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=183.48s)]
*  a threshold of one hundred and twelve or nine. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=187.48s)]
*  It's unclear if that's actually going to get any real vote and kind of momentum there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=189.2s)]
*  I do think that Speaker Johnson has a little bit more latitude, certainly more so than [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=199.28s)]
*  House Republicans want to move forward. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=200.28s)]
*  I think there's a lot of frustration, embarrassment over what happened over the last month where [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=202.28s)]
*  they were unable to elect a speaker. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  They had to go through this kind of very tough process of individual soul searching, coming [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=208.4s)]
*  up with Johnson, who, of course, is a fairly new figure for a lot of folks in terms of [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=212.36s)]
*  what his roles and responsibilities will look like. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=217.96s)]
*  He's still just even putting together his staff, John. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  So I don't think we quite know how he's going to approach this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=223.24s)]
*  I do think his openness on Ukraine funding is something that a lot of us were trying [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  to understand, where he would stand as a leader versus maybe where he was as just a member [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=230.36s)]
*  of the House. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=236.12s)]
*  And lastly, do we have any sense as to the outreach from the White House, what the relationship [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=237.12s)]
*  might be between the West Wing and the new speaker? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=242.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think this is all new for Mike Johnson, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=245.24s)]
*  He certainly was not a regular on the phone or at the White House with President Joe [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=249.68s)]
*  Biden. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=254.16s)]
*  He didn't even really have a relationship with many Senate Republicans, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=255.16s)]
*  I mean, some of them are saying they had to Google him to learn more about him. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=258.2s)]
*  And so I think it's a really unknown commodity when it comes to what he's going to be like, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  how he's going to govern. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  But certainly everybody's kind of watching the early tea leaves here because, of course, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  don't forget we have government funding that runs out on November 17th. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  And how he deals with that is going to be something that is going to be really critical [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=278.48s)]
*  in terms of whether or not we are headed towards a government shutdown. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=282.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's some sense that the hard right just might be too exhausted to fight this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=284.72s)]
*  for a shutdown right now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=287.68s)]
*  But we will find out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer, thank you as always for joining us this morning. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqkPyJW3qk&t=290.40000000000003s)]
