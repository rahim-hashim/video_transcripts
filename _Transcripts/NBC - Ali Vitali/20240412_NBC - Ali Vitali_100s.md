# Trump now claims he only wants to make Obamacare better
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk)
*  And while after eight years of vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act without offering a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=0.0s)]
*  viable replacement plan, Donald Trump now says he only wants to make Obamacare better. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  In a video posted to Truth Social yesterday, Trump claimed that President Joe Biden is [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=9.48s)]
*  misrepresenting his position on the health care plan used by roughly 40 million Americans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=14.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm not running to terminate the ACA, as crooked Joe Biden says all over the place. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=22.32s)]
*  I'm running to close the border, stop inflation, make our economy great, strengthen our military [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=27.82s)]
*  and make the ACA or Obamacare, as it's sometimes known, much better, stronger and far less [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=34.1s)]
*  expensive because it's much too expensive now and it's not very good. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=40.06s)]
*  Despite Trump's claims there, as recently as November, he wrote on social media that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=45.94s)]
*  he was looking at alternatives to the ACA and he bemoaned the failure of a 2017 Senate [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=49.74s)]
*  vote to repeal it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=55.74s)]
*  We should also point out that in his video yesterday, Trump said terminating Obamacare [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  was not his reason for running, but not that he wouldn't do it if he is re-elected. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=63.0s)]
*  Hey everyone, MSNBC has a new and improved app. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ddhr1JXZk&t=69.22s)]
