# Violent crime dropped across the U.S. last year: FBI
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI)
*  Violent crime across the United States is down. That's according to new data [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=0.0s)]
*  from the FBI. In its annual summary of crime in the nation, which was released [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=5.04s)]
*  yesterday, the FBI reported that violent crime dropped nationally from 2022 to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=9.8s)]
*  2023. Overall, violent crime was down roughly 3% with reports of murders [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=15.4s)]
*  following more than 11% year-over-year, the largest single-year decline in two [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=20.48s)]
*  decades. Property crime also down with burglaries dropping more than 7%, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=25.64s)]
*  although reports of car thefts went up by about 12%. During a campaign stop in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=29.8s)]
*  Pennsylvania yesterday, Donald Trump continued to falsely claim the crime is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=36.28s)]
*  through the roof while also complaining about being fact-checked about the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=41.0s)]
*  crime rate during the presidential debate held earlier this month. The crime [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=46.16s)]
*  just released and they are through the roof higher than I said. He corrected me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=52.44s)]
*  He said, No, crime has gone down. Only a stupid person would say crime has gone [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=58.04s)]
*  down. You don't have to know anything about numbers. If you live in this [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=63.08s)]
*  country, you know crime has gone up. And today it was reaffirmed that I was [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  right in the debate. Crime has gone way up there through the roof. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=73.08s)]
*  Joining us now, Paul, a surprise winning columnist and associate editor of the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=77.44s)]
*  Washington Post, Eugene Robinson. Eugene is also an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Eugene, good to see you this morning. So that's another lie from Donald Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  But crime is an issue. This year it certainly went up during the pandemic, as [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  those stats indicate, started to fall again significantly. So we also have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=96.32s)]
*  Vice President Harris being a former prosecutor. So let's talk about the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  dueling images that Harris and Trump are painting about crime. Of course, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=104.48s)]
*  only one of them supported by the facts. Yeah, that's right. And the Harris [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=108.36s)]
*  view is supported by the fact crime is down from last year. Crime is higher [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  than than most Americans would want, and it's higher than it was, um, you know, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  10 years ago, say. So, but it's nowhere near crime is nowhere near where it was [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=124.56s)]
*  back in the late eighties or early nineties when it reached a peak. Um, you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=132.52s)]
*  know, I could I could tell you any story you want to hear about why crime [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=138.8s)]
*  statistics go up and down. Uh, you can. There's some people who say it's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  demographics. Others say it's economics. Um, I've never seen a story that's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=148.12s)]
*  really convincing. But I think good, effective policing does help. Um, uh, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=153.14s)]
*  better economy does help. Whatever is helping is helping because Donald [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=162.08s)]
*  Trump is simply lying. Crime is going down. Yeah. And you're just so [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=168.24s)]
*  striking. Crime is just one of those issues. Crime, immigration, Ukraine's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=172.8s)]
*  fate against Russia, where Trump sort of ties his political prospects to the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=177.96s)]
*  outcome that's actually bad for the United States. It's like he's really [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  against his own country so often. Yeah, he is. And he paints this dystopian [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=186.08s)]
*  picture on the campaign trail of a country that's falling apart, a country [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=193.12s)]
*  that where the economy is in the toilet, where crime is so high that you can't [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  walk out of your house and go to the grocery store. Um, it's just a terrible [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  place. You know, when the windmills killing birds and I don't know, sharks [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=210.0s)]
*  and and batteries on boats or whatever, but it's all dystopian. And then he [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  presents himself as a solution. I'll fix everything on day one. I'll just come [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=222.88s)]
*  into office and everything will get better. It's a really bizarre, um, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  certainly false and dishonest way to run a campaign. But that's what he's got at [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  this point. Uh, you know, he can't point to actual numbers, actual statistics. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=240.18s)]
*  He can't say, wow, the economy is doing pretty well. That's a good thing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=245.5s)]
*  because then maybe we wouldn't need him. Yeah, certainly he paints himself. He [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  did that in his first term to, you know, suggesting that everything is doom and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=255.38s)]
*  gloom. He's the only solution. And contrast that with that more hopeful [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=259.42s)]
*  message coming from the Democrats. Yes, they acknowledge there's work to be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=262.82s)]
*  done, but sort of still believing in America's present and future. So, Eugene, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=265.86s)]
*  let's I know you've written about Mark Robinson, the embattled Republican [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=270.38s)]
*  candidate for governor of North Carolina, embattled, putting it lightly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  But let's talk about just what he means. Uh, what he represents to the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=278.14s)]
*  Republican Party and also how, frankly, it might not just cost a GOP, the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=282.98s)]
*  state house. He might cost Donald Trump, North Carolina. Well, he could be if he [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=286.74s)]
*  drags down the ticket. He's been trailing. Josh Stein, the Democrat in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=291.78s)]
*  this race all along. I cannot imagine that that situation will not get worse [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=297.82s)]
*  for Robinson and worse for the Republican Party in North Carolina. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=304.02s)]
*  After these revelations that came out in CNN last week, he represents the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  instinct that today's Republican Party has to any African American Trump [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  friendly conservative who sort of sticks his head up. They're willing to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=325.5s)]
*  just boost through, I guess, some sort of D. I. Initiative they have in the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=332.82s)]
*  Republican Party. They're willing to boost him right to the top. So in 2018, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=339.46s)]
*  Mark Robinson was just a guy worked at a furniture factory, supported gun [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=344.82s)]
*  rights, gave a fiery speech at a at a city council meeting. Uh, you know, two [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=349.97999999999996s)]
*  years later, he's being elected lieutenant governor. Uh, and four years [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=355.65999999999997s)]
*  after that, he's trying to become governor with no experience and with a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=360.94s)]
*  really, really checkered past. Yeah, while some Republicans starting to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=366.14s)]
*  distance themselves from the candidate, Donald Trump at this point has not. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=369.78s)]
*  And Democrats feeling better and better about their chances in North Carolina. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QykESj0vJbI&t=374.26s)]
