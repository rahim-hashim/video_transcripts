# Trump holds dominant lead in GOP primary, with 62% voter support
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg)
*  With Republican primary voting set to begin in under two weeks, new polling shows that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump still holds a commanding lead over his opponents. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=4.88s)]
*  According to new national numbers from USA Today and Suffolk University, Trump leads [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=8.84s)]
*  the field with 62% of support from registered GOP voters. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=13.52s)]
*  In second, a whopping 49 points behind the former president is former UN Ambassador Nikki [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=18.48s)]
*  Haley. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=23.48s)]
*  She's at 13. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=24.48s)]
*  She's followed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 10, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy at 7. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=25.48s)]
*  Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at 4. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=29.92s)]
*  In a hypothetical general election matchup, the poll shows Trump virtually tied with President [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=32.96s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=38.28s)]
*  He's up 44 to 43, but that's within the margin of error. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=39.28s)]
*  When third party candidates are included as options, Trump lead grows slightly, 37% to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  34%, RFK Junior at 10, but again, that even that three point margin within the poll's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=47.96s)]
*  margin of error. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now, politics reporter from Semaphore, Dave Weigel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=54.260000000000005s)]
*  Dave, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  You've had a recent piece for Semaphore that details several key dates for this year's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=59.8s)]
*  election cycle. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=64.6s)]
*  Give us one or two that you think are really going to matter, that maybe we're overlooking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=65.6s)]
*  as the potential for something newsworthy or a surprise. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=69.72s)]
*  Well, in early March, the first week of March, you're going to have Super Tuesday, you're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=73.28s)]
*  going to have the first clutch of big states. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=78.0s)]
*  That's going to end whatever primary that we're in at that point for the presidential [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=80.24s)]
*  race. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=85.08s)]
*  It's also going to kick off the Senate races, House races. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=86.08s)]
*  I would think have been under covered amidst everything else going on. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=88.84s)]
*  You're going to see whether Democrats have to spend tens of millions of dollars against [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=92.68s)]
*  each other in a California Senate race, or whether they get one Republican, one Democrat [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=96.28s)]
*  in a top two system. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=99.72s)]
*  You're going to see whether Lauren Boebert survives. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=100.94s)]
*  So you've got a kind of bifurcated calendar here where there is a presidential primary [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=103.0s)]
*  that might wrap up very soon, and then the election for everything else picking up a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=107.84s)]
*  very long six month primary season that everyone's going to turn their attention to right after. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=113.44s)]
*  So we just ran through some national polls, and obviously it's not a national election, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=117.84s)]
*  it's a state by state one. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=121.2s)]
*  But Trump, commanding lead, you've spent a lot of time on the ground in Iowa and New [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Hampshire. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=126.76s)]
*  What's your sense of the electorate in those two states for the GOP? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=127.76s)]
*  It is the polling that you just saw, the national polling is very close to what you're seeing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=131.0s)]
*  in Iowa. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=134.16s)]
*  The only discrepancy is there is more of a ground game there for Ron DeSantis built by [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=135.16s)]
*  Never Back Down. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=138.88s)]
*  There is one for Nikki Haley built by Americans Prosperity. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=140.06s)]
*  They are doing better in Iowa than they are doing in those national trial heats. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=142.56s)]
*  But Iowa is very tough for Trump to lose right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  It is in a more commanding position than any Republican has been in that primary. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=149.0s)]
*  You can compare it to George Bush in 2000, you can compare it to George H.W. in 1980. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  There's not much precedent for how well he's doing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  New Hampshire is the competitive primary. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=160.04s)]
*  Nothing else on the calendar in the next month is as close, and that is largely because of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=162.72s)]
*  non-affiliated voters in New Hampshire, independents, the sort of people that Chris Sununu is personally [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=168.32s)]
*  appealing to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  There are some people in the pack who have switched their party registration, some of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  whom I've met in New Hampshire who just want to slow Trump down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=176.12s)]
*  Iowa is next, but there is a sense when you talk to Republicans that New Hampshire is the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=179.56s)]
*  one that Donald Trump is worried about. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=185.16s)]
*  If you look at the campaign spending, even over the last few days, that is where the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=186.44s)]
*  Trump campaign, their packs are starting to attack Haley. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=190.12s)]
*  What sort of margin, we certainly think that Trump is still favored there. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  What chances do you give Haley of pulling the upset and actually winning, or coming [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=197.88s)]
*  in a close enough second that she'd have any shot going forward? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=201.6s)]
*  Because South Carolina, she likes to note, is next. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=205.2s)]
*  That's her home state. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=207.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=208.4s)]
*  But Trump might obliterate her there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=209.4s)]
*  He might, and there's an entire month where, imagine the best case scenario for Haley [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=210.4s)]
*  right now, which is coming in second in Iowa, knocking out Ron DeSantis. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=214.68s)]
*  Not that he would have to drop out, but it would be very hard for him to continue after [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=219.16s)]
*  that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=221.56s)]
*  Then winning New Hampshire. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=222.56s)]
*  I think if she won New Hampshire, there are a lot of people who don't follow politics [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=223.56s)]
*  that regularly, would find out, oh, somebody beat down Trump in a primary. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to pay attention to her. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=230.24s)]
*  But the South Carolina electorate is very conservative, evangelicals who love Donald [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=235.72s)]
*  The governor, a lot of legislators in the state have endorsed him. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=236.72s)]
*  Yes, the scenario you set up is very difficult for Trump's opponents to get past. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=240.96s)]
*  How do you win that state with a month of just Donald Trump dominating the news, spending [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=246.08s)]
*  money, attacking one person? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=251.28s)]
*  You've already seen how they're starting to attack her. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=252.88s)]
*  It's immigration, it's tax rates. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=254.56s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff in the quiver that they haven't used against Haley. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=257.44s)]
*  Haley's arguments against Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=260.92s)]
*  She's had counterattacks, she's had comebacks. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=262.08s)]
*  But all of them are just pushing the stone up the hill and running out of room because [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=264.96s)]
*  Trump is so popular with Republican voters. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=268.36s)]
*  So let's talk the Democratic side. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=270.32s)]
*  Later this month, President Biden will not appear on the primary ballot. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=271.56s)]
*  New Hampshire was this effort to change the calendar, but New Hampshire kind of said no. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=275.52s)]
*  But there's a movement underway to vote for him as a write-in candidate. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=279.24s)]
*  Tell me how that's going. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=281.96s)]
*  What should we lean into that? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=283.42s)]
*  It's going well for them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=285.24s)]
*  There's been just a little bit of polling in New Hampshire. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=286.8s)]
*  There'll be more the next week. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  And the option of writing in Biden is winning. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=290.76s)]
*  It's got a 50 to 60 percent in polling, depending on how you ask about it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not a hard name to spell. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=297.64s)]
*  It's a very well-known, it's a no-name. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=298.64s)]
*  There is a grassroots effort created in the last few months by Democratic strategists [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=300.38s)]
*  in the state. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=304.2s)]
*  They don't have or need that much money. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=305.2s)]
*  They're trying to raise maybe a million dollars, less than a million dollars, the entire thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=306.56s)]
*  Just inform registered New Hampshire Democrats. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=310.82s)]
*  You can show up, you can write in Biden, you can end this primary. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=313.48s)]
*  We can get on to beating Donald Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=316.28s)]
*  The Dean Phillips campaign, which is remaining in New Hampshire, campaigning across the state, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  it has not picked up a lot of Democrats as worried as they are about Biden's electability. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=324.84s)]
*  It has not broken through. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  There is just a reluctance among Democrats just to make the primary elongated and threaten [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=331.96s)]
*  Biden and make him campaign further for this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=338.0s)]
*  There is an attitude you find when you talk to Democrats there of how soon can we wrap [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=340.2s)]
*  this up? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=343.5s)]
*  We're going to head on to South Carolina for the first official primary where both [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=344.5s)]
*  the President and the Vice President are going to be spending a lot of time to make a decisive [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=346.5s)]
*  victory. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=349.9s)]
*  Let's get this over with. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=350.9s)]
*  Semaphores, Dave Weigel, thank you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=352.3s)]
*  Of course, we'll be hearing from the President this afternoon in an important speech on American [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=353.78s)]
*  democracy delivered from Valley Forge. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=357.14s)]
*  We'll bring you complete coverage of that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=359.18s)]
*  Thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on this Friday morning and all [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=361.26s)]
*  week long. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrVyHPf7rLg&t=365.22s)]
