# Sen. Thune unsure whether all of Trump's cabinet picks will be confirmed
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II)
*  In an interview on CBS yesterday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune appeared uncertain about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=0.0s)]
*  whether all of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks would be confirmed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=6.16s)]
*  I think that I suspect a lot of them will get through. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=11.28s)]
*  And we'll see about all of them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Remains to be seen. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=17.84s)]
*  But I think that's why we have the process and give all of these nominees an opportunity [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=18.84s)]
*  to make their case. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=23.44s)]
*  You've said you have to see if Democrats play ball or not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=24.44s)]
*  But you don't need Democrats to get these through. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=28.52s)]
*  So does that mean you already know some of your Republican senators won't vote to confirm [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=31.36s)]
*  Cash Patel at the FBI or Pete Hegsith at the Pentagon? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  We don't have, at this point, I don't think, clarity on that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=39.56s)]
*  I think these are nominees who are new enough. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=42.8s)]
*  They've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, frankly, have gone [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=45.8s)]
*  very well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=48.84s)]
*  But they still have to make their case in front of the committee. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=50.04s)]
*  And we don't know all the information about some of these nominees. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=53.12s)]
*  I think we know a lot about them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=56.6s)]
*  But they deserve a fair process. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  Those remarks come as CBS also reports Thune has privately told Trump he believes Pete [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=61.36s)]
*  Hegsith will have enough votes to be confirmed as Secretary of Defense. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  That's according to three sources. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=70.12s)]
*  Joining us now, senior NBC News national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  My friend, thank you for joining us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=76.28s)]
*  Just first, get your take on what Thune said about Hegsith's future and the rest of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=78.72s)]
*  cabinet in waiting. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=83.36s)]
*  So I promise to answer your question, but first, on behalf of your many fans, myself [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=84.36s)]
*  included, congratulations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=88.56s)]
*  We will do mimosas right after this segment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=90.6s)]
*  I'm going to keep this right over here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=92.88s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=95.52s)]
*  Look, I think if you're Jon Thune, you don't know exactly how your senators are going to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=96.96s)]
*  vote. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=101.12s)]
*  You know that some of them are still reluctant to vote for a couple of these candidates, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=102.12s)]
*  very worried about what might happen if those people were in charge. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=104.84s)]
*  I think Donald Trump has picked a variety of people who would be disruptive. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=109.68s)]
*  And I don't mean that in a pejorative sense, per se, but I think that's something that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=114.28s)]
*  the senators want to really look at. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  And particularly with Hegsith, there's some stuff in his background, his personal background, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=120.64000000000001s)]
*  his conduct in the past that I think is concerning. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, everything from allegations of misuse of alcohol to misuse of funds. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=127.4s)]
*  And then, of course, other allegations about being unfaithful in his marriages and, of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=131.4s)]
*  course, the sexual violence allegations as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=136.44s)]
*  All of that part and parcel to the Hegsith nomination, it's crucial. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=139.56s)]
*  And treatment of women in the charity that he operated, right? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=142.76s)]
*  Just beyond the women outside of that, just the treatment of women who work there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=146.96s)]
*  The Pentagon is a huge, huge organization with many women working there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=152.64s)]
*  And they need to have faith in their leadership that they're going to be treated fairly. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=157.96s)]
*  And so I think that's going to be a consideration, not just for the Democratic senators, but [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=162.02s)]
*  for a lot of the Republican senators as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=167.22s)]
*  I want to pivot away from the Hill for a second because I want to get your take on some new [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=169.18s)]
*  reporting that I have this morning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=172.02s)]
*  Four prominent current and former Congressional Black Caucus members are endorsing former Maryland [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=174.02s)]
*  Governor Martin O'Malley for DNC chair. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=178.62s)]
*  That includes one-time CBC chair Marsha Fudge, former January 6th committee chair Benny Thompson, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=181.5s)]
*  and others saying in a statement to NBC News, quote, Democrats are at a crossroads and we [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=186.78s)]
*  need a change now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=191.06s)]
*  Of course, the DNC election is set to be held on February 1st. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=192.72s)]
*  It's a five-way contest at this point. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=196.0s)]
*  But when you see these members coming, weighing in in favor of O'Malley, after Schumer himself [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=198.48s)]
*  made himself the highest ranking Democrat to weigh in on behalf of Ben Wickler out in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=203.68s)]
*  Wisconsin, what does this tell you about the race? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=207.32s)]
*  It tells me that there's a real division, a real factionalization with the party. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=210.7s)]
*  And some of it is ideological and some of it is more practical. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=214.2s)]
*  So, one set of endorsers seeing someone as stronger than the other for a variety of things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=220.68s)]
*  But what's fascinating about these members of Congress in particular, Benny Thompson, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=225.28s)]
*  Marsha Fudge, former member of Congress, they are extraordinarily influential within the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  African-American community, particularly the sort of political elite of the African-American [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  community. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  And their word is going to go a long way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  It's probably not just in terms of their influence, but also who they represent. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=243.08s)]
*  So, you know who might be riding with them into a storm. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=248.04s)]
*  They're extraordinarily close with Jim Clyburn. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=251.83999999999997s)]
*  They're extraordinarily close with Huckabee Jeffries, the House Minority Leader. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=254.16s)]
*  And so, this is good news for Martin O'Malley. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=258.36s)]
*  I definitely think that's the case. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=262.32s)]
*  When I saw this news and was able to report it, I thought for sure this is one of those [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=263.84s)]
*  things that when you know the behind-the-scenes way that things function, these are the key [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=267.4s)]
*  people who have sway within the party. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  And look, for these folks, we're about to set into a month of forums. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=274.68s)]
*  This is the start of picking the DNC chair. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=277.44s)]
*  It's far from over, but the battle is heating up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=279.44s)]
*  Senior NBC News National Politics reporter Jonathan Allen, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=281.88s)]
*  That was way too early for this Monday morning. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=287.08s)]
*  Morning Joe starts right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwKgy72c-II&t=289.08s)]
