# Biden: Trump is the primary threat to democracy at home
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY)
*  Welcome back. President Joe Biden is again warning about the threat he says Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=0.0s)]
*  poses to democracy. In a new interview with Univision that aired last night, Biden was [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  asked about the dangers America faces. Here's what the president had to say. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=12.4s)]
*  What in your view constitutes the primary threat to freedom and democracy at home? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=18.6s)]
*  Trump, seriously, Donald Trump talk uses phrases like we're gonna use eviscerate the Constitution. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=23.76s)]
*  He's gonna be a dictator on day one. He has a very, very, I think, jaded view of the Constitution. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=31.92s)]
*  He made it clear that he doesn't plan on biting by parts of it if he thinks it's not appropriate. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=39.36s)]
*  And it's just, at least he's saying it out loud. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=46.8s)]
*  And now, White House correspondent for Politico and co-author of the playbook, about to hit your inboxes, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=51.16s)]
*  our friend Eugene Daniels. Eugene, good to see you. So let's start there with the president's sit down interview with Univision. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=56.8s)]
*  It comes as polls show at least some growing support for Donald Trump among Latino voters. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  How concerned is Biden's team about that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=70.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're really concerned. And the way you can tell is because they started investing really early in the Latino vote. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=72.8s)]
*  Months ago, putting together an entire organization that's job is just to focus on the Latino vote, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  especially in those swing states, states like Arizona and Nevada, right, where there are huge populations of Latinos. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And what's really difficult about this issue for them is that Latinos are kind of the perfect encapsulation of a minority group not being a monolith, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=95.2s)]
*  They can be all over the place, just like white people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  And the kinds of things they think, the things at the top of their list, a lot of sometimes politicians often think immigration, for example, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=110.88s)]
*  is where they need to what they need to talk about with Latinos. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=118.36s)]
*  And that's not what we're seeing in polling and haven't for a very long time, that that's the number one issue, that that's not their number one issue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=121.08s)]
*  The economy, crime, inflation, all of those things are at the top of their list. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=127.32s)]
*  The administration clearly this this down with Univision is an example of their outreach to those groups. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=132.0s)]
*  But they've also been doing other things like the vice president has been traveling. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  She will be going to Arizona. She'll be talking about abortion for the most part. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=143.8s)]
*  But that's also an aspect of this Latino outreach. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=147.52s)]
*  Yes. Well, let's turn now, Eugene, to some new reporting. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  You have a story you broke overnight where one of President Biden's most trusted advisors is openly and publicly questioning some of his campaign strategy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. So Ron claimed the former White House chief of staff was at an event yesterday, basically in front of a bunch of economic activists, is the way that he put it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  I was sent an audio clip of what he said. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=172.11999999999998s)]
*  And what he said is, I think the president is out there too much talking about bridges. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=174.56s)]
*  He does two or three events a week where he's cutting a ribbon or a bridge. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  And basically, if people are going in the grocery stores and the prices are expensive, they're not going to think about a bridge. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  She also added that the president is not a congressman. He's not running for Congress. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=190.04s)]
*  I think it's kind of a fool's errand. I think that it also doesn't cover that much because it's just a bridge. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  This is kind of the first time, the first one of the first times that we've seen Ron claim question the messaging coming from the White House on really any issue. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, I called him up last night to to see if he had any comment. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  And he did. He didn't back down from from the criticism, though he said it wasn't a criticism. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=214.56s)]
*  He was very clear about that. But what he said was he wants to continue to see this White House, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  and more importantly, the president, kind of just focus on what they talked about in the state of the union and not too much about, you know, cutting, cutting ribbons, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=225.72s)]
*  going to the bridges, but talking about all the other things that they have in contrast to Donald Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=234.08s)]
*  The White House obviously thinks that they've been doing that and they have been doing a lot of that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=240.64s)]
*  But what claim is saying is something that you hear from Democrats kind of across the board sometimes where they worry about how this administration and therefore this campaign are selling to the American people, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=245.76s)]
*  their past accomplishments, focusing too much on that and not too much on what the future might look like. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, claim does not have an official role with reelection campaign, but he's informally advising quickly with debate prep. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=263.56s)]
*  He also singularly focused on prices. He would as chief of staff, you'll recall he would start every day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=268.76000000000005s)]
*  First thing he would do, check the price of gas. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=274.36s)]
*  Eugene's a big day at the White House. President Biden is hosting Japanese Prime Minister Kishida for a state visit. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=277.16s)]
*  The two men are going to have a couple of hours worth of meetings, a joint news conference and a lavish state dinner tonight. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=283.44000000000005s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit about what's on the agenda. What are some of the goals here? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=288.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they had a dinner last night running around in D.C. together, hanging out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=293.28s)]
*  And I mean, at the top of this list, though, this administration has always pushed back when we write a story like this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=299.84s)]
*  But it's true that all of this is really about China and making sure that this administration, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  the United States, finds ways to keep a foothold in that region. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  The Philippines leader will be here later on this week talking with these two men. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=318.0s)]
*  But basically, there are a lot of things on the agenda, including the first Japanese astronaut going on an ASTM mission, those kinds of things. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=325.16s)]
*  But also continuing and more importantly, making a concrete military partnership here, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=335.56s)]
*  while at the same time trying not to basically anger China too much. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=344.32s)]
*  They want to keep China on notice in this region. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=348.64s)]
*  And, Eugene, lastly, let's go back to our top story, which is this Arizona abortion ruling, as you mentioned, the vice president heading there later this week. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=352.2s)]
*  Give us a brief sense as to how else the White House hopes to really push this issue. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=359.4s)]
*  I mean, one of the things and it goes right at that clip you showed right before we started talking, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=363.76s)]
*  is that trying to talk about this issue as a concept of freedom, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=368.48s)]
*  That it's at the heart of the way this reelection campaign thinks about Donald Trump as a threat. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=372.68s)]
*  You had what Donald Trump said on Monday and immediately you had this Democrat, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=378.28s)]
*  the Democrats and this campaign in this White House attacking him for kind of wanting it both ways. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=383.08s)]
*  And so what you're going to see from them moving forward, especially from this vice president, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  is talking about this issue as not just a women's issue, not just an issue of health care. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  It's all those things, but more importantly, an issue of freedom and whether or not people have access to be able to do what they want to do with their bodies, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=400.16s)]
*  not just in certain states, but kind of across the board here. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=407.16s)]
*  And we'll have much more on all these stories in the hours ahead. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=410.16s)]
*  White House correspondent for Politico, Eugene Daniels. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZtfyiNYQzY&t=413.32s)]
