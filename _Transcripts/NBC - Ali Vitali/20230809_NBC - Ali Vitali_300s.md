# Excessive heat warnings issued across the south
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ)
*  I'm going to turn now to a couple of important health related stories, starting with this one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  More than 60 million people from Arizona to Florida are currently under an excessive heat warning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=4.0s)]
*  The Washington Post is predicting that Dallas, New Orleans, Phoenix, and Orlando [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=11.0s)]
*  will be among the hottest cities this week with heat indexes as high as 115 degrees. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=16.0s)]
*  The National Weather Service is now recommending people stay in air conditioned places, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=22.0s)]
*  drink lots of water, and wear light, loose fitting clothes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=27.0s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News medical contributor, Dr. Vin Gupta. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=32.0s)]
*  Dr. Gupta, great to talk to you again. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=37.0s)]
*  It has been an extraordinary summer of heat around the world, but certainly here in the United States. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=39.0s)]
*  What are some of the biggest health concerns as this record breaking heat wave continues? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=44.0s)]
*  And do you have any other advice to add as to how people should try to protect themselves? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=50.0s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, thank you for always highlighting this vital story, something that we need to be talking more about. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=55.0s)]
*  First, the problem here. Among the highest risk counties, Jonathan, across the country on the heat wave, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=61.0s)]
*  southwest in Florida, we know 45% of individuals in those counties, that part of the country, are underinsured or uninsured. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=68.0s)]
*  18% are a high risk senior population. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=77.0s)]
*  That's important because we know that the most vulnerable are often the ones who don't have durable health care insurance, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=81.0s)]
*  who don't have HVAC systems in their home. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=88.0s)]
*  But things are going to get worse, particularly for that group here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=90.0s)]
*  What we've seen in places like Phoenix and places like Houston, to answer your question about health risks here, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=93.0s)]
*  is the traditional rise in ER visits. Upwards of a 50% increase, Jonathan, in certain places like Houston Methodist, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=98.0s)]
*  as a result of heat exhaustion, traditional heat stroke. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=106.0s)]
*  But we're even seeing now new evidence that there's a link, a very strong link, it appears, between prolonged exposure to heat [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=111.0s)]
*  and disease conditions like dementia that we previously didn't realize existed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=118.0s)]
*  There is even more research suggesting maybe there's a link between heat and aging, premature aging, but lots we still are learning. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=123.0s)]
*  And we're going to have to learn and learn soon with this obviously growing impact of climate change. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=131.0s)]
*  Dr. Gupta, the other, of course, health story we're following, COVID-19. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=137.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, this is not a surge this summer, at least not yet, like previous summers, but cases are up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=142.0s)]
*  Cases are up, hospitalizations are up across the country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=148.0s)]
*  So give us an update. But then secondly, tell us as we head into the fall, what Americans should be doing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=151.0s)]
*  The young, adults, the elderly, what should we be doing in terms of vaccinations? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=158.0s)]
*  What should we be receiving and when? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=164.0s)]
*  Well, thanks, Jonathan, for that, Tia. Critical to stay prepared for the fall and the winter here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=167.0s)]
*  Where are we? We're about 9,000 hospitalizations across the country from COVID-19. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Let's give some context here. What does that mean? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=179.0s)]
*  In January of this year, we're at 45,000. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=182.0s)]
*  So we're 20 percent the level of the worst we've seen from COVID in year four of the pandemic here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=185.0s)]
*  So very different reality right now than, say, prior summers, 2020, and certainly 2021 when it was a lot worse. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=191.0s)]
*  Highest hospitalizations we've seen is over 100,000. So things are a lot different right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=200.0s)]
*  So that's good. Well, we're seeing this new variant, EG5. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=205.0s)]
*  We aren't talking a lot about it because, frankly, the existing vaccines protect against it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=208.0s)]
*  It continues to be more contagious and so very transmissible here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=214.0s)]
*  Existing vaccines still do work. When it comes to vaccines here for you and your loved ones, for everybody watching, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=219.0s)]
*  really important to recognize that the FDA is going to have a new set of vaccines out against some of these newer variants probably middle of September. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=227.0s)]
*  If you were able, this existing evidence does suggest that if you're able to space out the vaccines, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=235.0s)]
*  probably that might be the strategy here. That's what I recommend my patients two weeks between vaccines, say flu and COVID. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=241.0s)]
*  You can get them together. There's no safety risk if you were to get them together. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=248.0s)]
*  But if you are able to space them out and make a few trips to a pharmacy or a sugar clinic, it is preferred here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=252.0s)]
*  Two week delay between the vaccines here starting mid-September though. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly we should, of course, keep in mind COVID still with us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=264.0s)]
*  And certainly as the fall arrives, I'm certain we're going to be talking about it more often. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=268.0s)]
*  And we'd love to have you back. NBC News medical contributor Dr. Vangupta, thank you as always. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=273.0s)]
*  We're glad to talk to you today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=278.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVfnyWbrzMQ&t=293.0s)]
