# GOP walking impeachment inquiry tightrope
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ)
*  From back, Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis is doubling down on her push [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to have all co-defendants in the election interference RICO case appear in court together. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Willis listed her reasoning for wanting a group trial in a new court filing, including [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=10.52s)]
*  security issues and an unnecessary strain on judicial resources if the case separated [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=14.72s)]
*  into multiple trials. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=21.0s)]
*  She also stressed that with a connected RICO charge, the cases would quote, share the same [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=22.92s)]
*  evidence and witnesses. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=27.96s)]
*  This comes after a hearing last week where Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee was skeptical [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=29.82s)]
*  of the possibility of keeping so many witnesses together in one trial. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=35.26s)]
*  The judge said he would rule on scheduling a speedy trial for two defendants by tomorrow, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=38.82s)]
*  which could shed light on the likelihood of keeping all the cases together. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=44.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, turning back to our top story now, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin reacted to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's decision to launch an impeachment inquiry into President [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=52.86s)]
*  Biden. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=57.260000000000005s)]
*  Here's the bottom line. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=59.26s)]
*  The majority and the Republicans in the House of Representatives are out of control. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=60.78s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=66.74s)]
*  Bottom line. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=67.74s)]
*  This is just a diversion on the part of McCarthy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=68.74s)]
*  He cannot govern. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=70.14s)]
*  He cannot get his majority in the House of Representatives to do the basics to keep the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=71.62s)]
*  government's lights on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=76.34s)]
*  And so he's decided for a diversion. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=77.78s)]
*  Let's talk about something else that they might agree on, an impeachment. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=79.68s)]
*  Joining us now, national political correspondent for Axios, Alex Thompson. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=84.94s)]
*  Alex, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=89.14s)]
*  So let's talk about the reactions from both sides, Ziyal, starting with the Democrats. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=90.18s)]
*  So let's go there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=94.38000000000001s)]
*  Behind closed doors, is there a sense from Democrats that this impeachment inquiry, as [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  painful as it potentially could be in the process, might actually help them next year, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=99.94000000000001s)]
*  bolstering both President Biden's chances of reelection, but also the Dems' chances [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  of regaining control of Congress? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=109.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=111.94s)]
*  I mean, I think there is still an outside possibility that you could even see Nancy [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=112.94s)]
*  Pelosi make a comeback, but if they do retake the House. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=117.5s)]
*  And I think there is this thought that this could be a sort of 1998 situation in which [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  the American public said that the Republican House at that time when they were impeaching [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=125.33999999999999s)]
*  President Clinton are really, in some ways, are overstepping and that they are not focused [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  on what the American people really care about. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=135.82s)]
*  You have to remember that the president and the White House's entire messaging about all [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=138.45999999999998s)]
*  of this has been, about the Republican Party in general, has been mega extremist, mega [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=143.94000000000003s)]
*  extremist. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  And sometimes the most extreme thing that you could possibly do is do an impeachment. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  And so in some ways, I think some Democrats optimistically think that nothing will come [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=154.86s)]
*  in terms of this impeachment inquiry, in terms of damning evidence against the president. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=161.06s)]
*  And as a result, this could rebound to their political benefit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=165.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=167.82000000000002s)]
*  And certainly there are Republicans who have that concern as well, including, particularly, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=168.82000000000002s)]
*  those who won in districts that President Biden has also won, trying to, those more [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=173.78s)]
*  moderate-ish Republicans. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=179.22s)]
*  When you speak to them, what's their level of concern that this could really blow up [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=184.06s)]
*  in their faces? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=187.74s)]
*  Well, this is one of the reasons that Kevin McCarthy reversed and flip-flopped and decided [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=188.74s)]
*  not to hold an actual impeachment inquiry vote. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=195.5s)]
*  This would have set up, first of all, it's not clear that he has those votes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=199.72s)]
*  And it also would put his, these Biden district Republicans that you're talking about, in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=203.84s)]
*  a jam, where they would have to be voting on an issue, and they're sort of in trouble [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=208.56s)]
*  either way. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=216.96s)]
*  If they don't vote for the inquiry, President Trump has threatened primary challenges. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=217.96s)]
*  And if they do vote for the inquiry, then they could also be facing trouble in the general [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=222.56s)]
*  election. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=227.84s)]
*  So, Alex, you've also got some new reporting out this morning on a couple of past statements [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=228.96s)]
*  made by President Biden that Republicans are honing in on, and they're going to try to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=232.32s)]
*  use for their inquiry. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=236.8s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=238.34s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=239.34s)]
*  In the final weeks of the presidential election in 2020, President Biden said at that second [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=240.34s)]
*  presidential debate that his son Hunter never took money from China. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=245.4s)]
*  And he also said that, his campaign also said that he never met with one of Hunter's business [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=251.6s)]
*  associates. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=256.76s)]
*  And sworn testimony over the last month of Hunter and his business partner Devin Archer [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=258.68s)]
*  have contradicted those statements. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=261.92s)]
*  Now, we should emphasize that not telling the truth or conflicting statements during [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=264.12s)]
*  a presidential campaign has never been an impeachable offense, given that it would probably [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=268.52s)]
*  mean impeaching every single president in American history. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=273.32s)]
*  But the fact is that Kevin McCarthy really has honed in. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=277.32s)]
*  He said yesterday that President Biden lied to the American people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=280.0s)]
*  But this is, of course, a risk, because if they don't find more than just that President [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=284.24s)]
*  Biden's blanket denials were not exactly true, then this could lead to this potential backlash [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=288.52s)]
*  that we discussed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=294.6s)]
*  So it is sort of a risky bet on behalf of Republicans. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=295.88s)]
*  But I must say, the White House has not really given much clarification about why these, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=299.24s)]
*  about these conflicting accounts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=304.56s)]
*  And I expect they're going to have to at some point. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=306.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=308.48s)]
*  I did say that Hunter and the president didn't, the now president, didn't discuss business [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  at the time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=314.04s)]
*  But talk to us, the Hunter Biden part of this is something that the White House is going [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=315.04s)]
*  to navigate. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  Alex, give us a quick sense as to as they prepare to defend themselves against this [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  inquiry, what sort of coordination is there going to be between the West Wing and Hunter [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=322.16s)]
*  Biden's legal team? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=325.04s)]
*  I mean, this is a great question, because the thing is that the coordination between [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=326.04s)]
*  Hunter Biden's legal team and the White House broke down last December when Hunter Biden [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=330.44s)]
*  essentially pushed out the lawyer that the White House, the White House had brought in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=335.32s)]
*  to assist him. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  He brought in his own lawyer, Abby Lowell. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, Hunter was always a little bit more of the pugnacious of President Biden's sons. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=343.44s)]
*  And he is eager for a fight, which is why you bring in a lawyer like Abby Lowell. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=349.23999999999995s)]
*  The White House has been much more on the side of let's not engage in the Hunter stuff. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=354.23999999999995s)]
*  Let's only keep the focus on President Biden and we're confident he did nothing wrong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  I think this is a dynamic that's going to be a bit fraught in the coming months. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=363.32s)]
*  And let's just underscore there has yet to be any evidence provided of any wrongdoing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=367.84s)]
*  by President Biden and fears from both sides of the aisle that this process is cheapening [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=371.35999999999996s)]
*  impeachment itself, which is supposed to be just rare and for grave circumstances. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdQVpg_EHIQ&t=376.11999999999995s)]
