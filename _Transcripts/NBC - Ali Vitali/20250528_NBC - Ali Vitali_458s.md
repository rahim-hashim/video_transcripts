# Sen. Tuberville launches run for Alabama governor
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA)
*  Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama has announced he's running for governor of his [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=0.0s)]
*  home state. The football coach turned lawmaker announced his run yesterday with the launch of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=4.48s)]
*  a campaign website. This was long anticipated. Chouk Tuberville, a staunch ally of President Trump, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  enters the race as the favorite to replace current governor Kay Ivey, who's finishing her second term. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=14.32s)]
*  Tuberville is the second sitting senator to launch a bid for governor this year, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=19.6s)]
*  following Democratic Senator Michael Bennett of Colorado. And the coach to Senator Pipeline could [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=23.04s)]
*  continue in Alabama. One of the names being floated to replace Tuberville is Auburn's [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=28.16s)]
*  men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl. Joining us now, congressional reporter for the news publication [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=32.16s)]
*  Notice, Daniella Diaz. Daniella, we'll get to coach in just a minute, but first let's start with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=37.2s)]
*  Musk saying a bill can be big and it can be beautiful, but it can't be both. You think [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=42.0s)]
*  Republican lawmakers are going to be happy to hear that sentiment from a guy who they've championed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=46.16s)]
*  and defended his work? Absolutely not. What's interesting is that he's deciding to say this [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  while everyone's out of Washington. You noted earlier that the Senate is out, Ali. House and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=54.8s)]
*  Senate lawmakers are currently back in their home states meeting with constituents to talk about this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  one big, beautiful bill on both sides. Getting the heat about potential Medicaid cuts, about the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=64.16s)]
*  lack of deficit spending that some conservatives said that they had to do to be able to pass this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=71.92s)]
*  bill in the House last week to go back home. So hearing this from Elon is really interesting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=76.96s)]
*  because he hasn't really weighed in on this legislation leading up to this moment. He's kind [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=82.08s)]
*  of been disappearing from the limelight in the past couple of weeks, which we've all been covering [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=87.2s)]
*  pretty closely. But next week, the Senate is going to take up this bill. And this is someone that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=90.8s)]
*  Republicans have looked to, especially with these Doge cuts as exactly a champion for the Republican [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=96.48s)]
*  agenda. So him saying this could potentially complicate things when the Senate takes up this [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=102.4s)]
*  legislation, which is already going to be complicated because they do not like the version [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=107.84s)]
*  that the House Republican conference passed. But then also just curious to see how they're [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=111.52s)]
*  going to move forward once it goes back to the House. And you need to get all those Republicans [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=116.88s)]
*  back on board. And we saw how incredibly difficult that was last week for Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=121.92s)]
*  Yeah, we've talked about the balancing act here. So as if it wasn't complicated enough, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=126.56s)]
*  Elon Musk entering the chat, further complicating the situation potentially. We're going to dig into [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=130.64s)]
*  more of Musk a little bit later in the show. But for now, I want to pivot a little bit to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=135.44s)]
*  news about Tommy Tuberville running for governor back home in Alabama. He had a short but I think [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  notable tenure here in Washington specifically for the way that he held up all of those Defense [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Department promotions over the course of what was it a year ago, two years ago now. But this is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=151.92s)]
*  something that we end up seeing people leaving office and running for other positions talk about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=157.44s)]
*  the retirements list, the people who are questing for other office. It's not just Tuberville, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=163.6s)]
*  Michael Bennett, but then there's also a bunch of House members who have higher aspirations as well. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=168.72s)]
*  Exactly, Ali. I mean, it's really interesting when they won't publicly say it, but I talk to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=172.64s)]
*  lawmakers on Capitol Hill on both sides every day. And it's just a very not fun place to work [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  these days. And they will tell you that some of them even on the record, but for the most part, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=184.48s)]
*  they're trying to figure out what they can do other than being in Congress when it's so [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=188.56s)]
*  dysfunctional. But it's interesting that you know specifically about the blockade that Senator [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=192.88s)]
*  Tuberville had about two years ago, 10 months where he was blocking military nominees over the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=198.16s)]
*  military's abortion stance and policies that really soured his relationship with Republicans [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  on the Hill. And that might be a key reason for why he decided he would only serve one term and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=209.2s)]
*  would return back to Alabama. But it's important to note that these members really don't love what [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=214.96s)]
*  they're doing on Capitol Hill. It's been really difficult for them on both sides. Democrats and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=222.0s)]
*  the minority seeking office elsewhere, Republicans saying, you know, this is actually a lot harder [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=226.4s)]
*  than what I thought it would be. Let me go seek higher office elsewhere. So that's what we're [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=231.44s)]
*  seeing take place. And this won't be the last announcement we'll see in the next two years [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  before the next election. No, I think that's right. I mean, there's also an open question about when [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  you're talking about people running for governor, who ends up running for governor in New York? Is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  it Elise Stefanik? Is it Mike Lawler? Both of them clearly are putting feelers out right now to see [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=248.8s)]
*  what their aspirations could be there. So we're talking about razor thin margins in the House, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=254.16s)]
*  potentially meaning people could miss votes. We'll end up seeing what that ultimately looks like. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=258.88s)]
*  But there's a lot more of these kinds of announcements to come for sure. But when you're [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=262.88s)]
*  also talking about seeking higher positions, you could also do that by being in the House. And with [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=267.36s)]
*  the sad death of Jerry Connolly, that does leave open the top oversight committee position. And it's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=272.64s)]
*  a four way race that's going to, I think, tell us a lot about generational tensions within the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=279.12s)]
*  caucus. What kind of leadership Hakeem Jeffries is going to back behind the scenes privately to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=284.48s)]
*  be elevated. Just walk us through the contours of this race and why it matters. Yeah. You know, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=289.44s)]
*  Gary, Jerry Connolly, his death, obviously very sad. House Democrats really try to give time for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=294.48s)]
*  that to mourn that. But now, obviously, his position on this really key committee that publicly [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=301.92s)]
*  fights back against the Trump administration and its policies. That's why it's important for [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=308.24s)]
*  Democrats to have a frontward facing Democrat who's a good communicator, good on TV in this role. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=311.92s)]
*  They're going to start looking for who could replace him. It's a four way race right now with [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=318.24s)]
*  Robert Garcia from California, the Fumey of Maryland, Stephen Lynch, who's currently acting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=323.44s)]
*  as the top Democrat on this committee of Massachusetts, and Jasmine Crockett of Texas. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  So again, we're seeing what took place in December between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=332.8s)]
*  and Jerry Connolly, this established Democrat who's older, who has been in several terms [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=337.68s)]
*  in Congress, who's maybe not as well known versus a fresher face, diverse, progressive. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  And so we're going to see what the Democratic caucus does when they return for this election [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  on June 24th, so just a couple of weeks. And they're going to meet as a caucus and decide [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=355.68s)]
*  who should be this frontward facing role of this very key committee that gets a lot of airtime [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  on TV, that gets, you know, has a lot of viral moments. But right now it seems like it's really [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=366.24s)]
*  anyone's to get. There's not really clear front runner after, especially Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=371.36s)]
*  said a couple of weeks ago, she's not interested in that top job. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=377.76s)]
*  Yeah, I do think this is ultimately going to tell us a lot both about Democrats, but also about the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=380.32s)]
*  role that Hakeem Jeffries plays as sort of the committee kingmaker behind the scenes. Is he [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=386.0s)]
*  someone who falls in line with the way that Pelosi used to do things, which is seniority and loyalty [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=391.44s)]
*  are rewarded? Is he someone who leans into the concerns that many in the caucus have voiced to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=396.16s)]
*  you, to me, to others about the fact that their message is not getting out there? And someone like [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=400.8s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett or someone like Robert Garcia have been able to grab the attention mantle [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  and hold it, not just during the 2024 campaign when Crockett was a consistent surrogate on the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=410.56s)]
*  road, but then also as she has come back to Congress and had many a viral moment. I think [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  we're ultimately going to learn a lot about how that plays out. June 24th, right? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=420.88s)]
*  June 24th, caucus-wide, it'll be a really interesting observation of the caucus and see what happens. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=424.56s)]
*  Yeah, we're just looking for plot points now, trying to draw some conclusions. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=431.12s)]
*  Daniela Diaz, my partner in that, as always. Thank you, my friend. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OmPBeQkCPA&t=434.32s)]
