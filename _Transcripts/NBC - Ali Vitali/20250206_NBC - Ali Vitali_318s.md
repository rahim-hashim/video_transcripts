# Protesters, lawmakers rally against Trump's stop-work order for USAID employees
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ)
*  Protesters gathered on Capitol Hill yesterday to push back on the Trump administration's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  decision to furlough nearly all USAID employees. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=6.48s)]
*  NBC News spoke with several USAID staffers, contractors, implementing partners and supporters [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=10.16s)]
*  at the rally who say they're devastated by what's happening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=16.12s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers joined the protest, the latest amid their resistance-themed news conferences [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  aiming to combat Trump's moves to remake the government via executive power. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=24.5s)]
*  Now sources say USAID employees and contractors are planning legal pushback too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=29.32s)]
*  Lawsuits based on loss of income could be used to bring up constitutional claims over [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=34.24s)]
*  presidential power. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=38.44s)]
*  Additionally, lawyers say non-profit groups could argue the government has violated a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=40.0s)]
*  law requiring agencies to follow the correct legal procedures, question the legal authority [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=43.800000000000004s)]
*  of Elon Musk's Doge, and allege that the administration is unlawfully withholding funds that have [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=49.0s)]
*  already been appropriated by Congress. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=54.68000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now, Matthew Bartlett. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=57.56s)]
*  He was a former US State Department appointee during Trump's first term. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=59.2s)]
*  Matt, thanks for joining us here now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  I know that you've made the point that there have been other efforts in the past to come [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  for USAID, but why is this one different and why does this agency need, should continue [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=69.12s)]
*  to stand on its own the way it has? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=75.2s)]
*  Yeah, Ali, thanks for having me on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=77.48s)]
*  As I said, I was an appointee in the Trump State Department. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=79.76s)]
*  I am still a Republican, and there is truly still a bipartisan call to save lives around [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  the world in America's interests. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=89.72s)]
*  But there's always a lot of conversations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  What is the most efficient way of doing so? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=93.92s)]
*  Again, this is not a charity for an aid. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=95.76s)]
*  This is advancing American interests, so we should be smart about it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=98.76s)]
*  We should want to make sure that every dollar is money not down a rat hole, down a water [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  hole. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  But right now, this is not a conversation around reform. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  This is not disruption. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  This is destruction. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=112.12s)]
*  We are seeing a massive effort in a very short amount of time by a few, a handful of people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=113.56s)]
*  around the Doge team, some of the appointees that are ending foreign aid, not just putting [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=119.4s)]
*  it into the State Department, but putting it out of business that's dangerous and it's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=123.92s)]
*  potentially deadly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=128.24s)]
*  Well, because I want to ask you about the conversations that you've been having with [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=129.24s)]
*  members of USAID. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  You've been having a lot of conversations. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=134.76s)]
*  We've been talking to them as they've been attending these kinds of protests. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=136.28s)]
*  What's their biggest concern here? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, most importantly, let's just be very, very clear. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=141.68s)]
*  There are people on life-saving medications because of the United States of America. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=145.56s)]
*  It's been 20 years. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=149.84s)]
*  The program's called PEPFAR. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=150.84s)]
*  It's been the majority of my professional work, and we do it in honor of this country [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=151.84s)]
*  because we are the good guys. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=156.02s)]
*  We save lives around the world. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=157.72s)]
*  Right now, that program is in jeopardy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=159.52s)]
*  The secretary, Secretary Rubio, a longtime champion of human rights, of global health, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=161.2s)]
*  of foreign assistance, has issued a waiver to allow this program to continue on. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=166.84s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=171.64s)]
*  This program is done in hand-in-hand with CDC and with USAID. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=172.72s)]
*  So if they are crippled, if they are not allowed to work, PEPFAR is unable to make sure that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=177.88s)]
*  we are saving lives every single day. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=182.2s)]
*  So there are some deadly consequences here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  This may be an overly administrative question, but why wouldn't it work to have USAID under [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=186.24s)]
*  state? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=193.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=194.28s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=195.36s)]
*  I wish we were having that conversation because, boy, that sounds pretty reasonable. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=196.36s)]
*  See, that's the thing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=198.96s)]
*  That's what Rubio is trying to say, but certainly that's not what they're doing right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=199.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=204.8s)]
*  We've seen, and I think it'd be naive to not acknowledge, that we've seen some pretty [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=205.8s)]
*  egregious programming through USAID, maybe even some political activism. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=209.82s)]
*  Listen, I'm a Republican. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=215.0s)]
*  I'm a conservative. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=216.6s)]
*  These are not the priorities that I would have funded over the last four years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=217.88s)]
*  Well, congratulations. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=220.8s)]
*  You just won the election. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=222.24s)]
*  Now, it is your duty to not abolish it, but to affirm it, to make sure it is run right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  If we're talking about reforms to USAID, I'm here for that conversation, but that's not [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  what is happening right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=234.0s)]
*  It is a perilous time and a very short amount of time. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=235.0s)]
*  Again, I even applaud some of these doge guys. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=238.68s)]
*  Efficiency? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not here to defend bureaucracy by no stretch of the imagination. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  This is America. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Think different, as Steve Jobs used to say, but not think dumb. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  This is not a wise way of just shutting down USAID. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=252.68s)]
*  I guess my last question is, where are the other Republicans on this, especially on Capitol [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=256.24s)]
*  Hill, especially among the elected ranks? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=260.68s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen some whiplash. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=263.04s)]
*  This has gone very, very fast. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  Interestingly enough, we've had Senator Wicker making comments. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Josh Hawley, Senator Josh Hawley said, I'm not even sure Elon Musk has the legal authority [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=271.24s)]
*  to do that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=276.44s)]
*  So you're seeing some voices pop up. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=277.44s)]
*  You're seeing some ardent defenders of foreign assistance programs, programs like PEPFAR. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=279.92s)]
*  Congress has oversight. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=285.12s)]
*  But again, this is a very, very fluid time with some internal forces inside and outside [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=286.12s)]
*  of the State Department. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=291.68s)]
*  Yeah, and you're hearing from a lot of them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=292.68s)]
*  Matthew Barlett, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=294.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0V-irhBFQ&t=309.32s)]
