# Biden team raises $10 million in 24 hours after State of the Union
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY)
*  The Biden campaign hit record fundraising numbers in the wake of the president's state of the union [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=0.0s)]
*  address. In the 24 hours after Biden's remarks concluded Thursday night, his reelection campaign [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=5.36s)]
*  raked in 10 million dollars. That's a real number and it's the largest 24-hour haul the campaign and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=11.68s)]
*  its affiliated committees have seen so far. Joining us now, White House reporter for Bloomberg News, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=17.84s)]
*  our friend Josh Wingroves. So Josh, there is a, that's a big fundraising number for 24 hours. It [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=23.2s)]
*  adds to what was a significant advantage in terms of cash on hand. Biden already enjoys [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=28.88s)]
*  over Donald Trump. We're also seeing Biden really increase the pace of travel. Pennsylvania and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=34.72s)]
*  Georgia last week, he's going to New Hampshire. He's got Michigan and Wisconsin coming up. It is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=40.64s)]
*  Biden-mentum. Talk to us about it. Yeah, we're going to see that sort of drum beat continue this [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=45.76s)]
*  week, John. Of course, we've got the budget today, big day at Bloomberg, you know, all our friends [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=51.2s)]
*  watching closely. We'll come back to that in a minute. Yeah, that'll be good. That'll be good. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=56.4s)]
*  He is trying to really sort of get that momentum going both in terms of the fundraising that you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  mentioned, but also just in terms of the polls and they're still looking for the sort of that rebound [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=64.24s)]
*  off the speech, but also off some of the more recent news, like the economic data that we've seen. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=69.68s)]
*  And you know, it's too early to say whether they'll get that on the polls, but these fundraising [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=73.84s)]
*  numbers are really encouraging. And it's actually one of the things Democrats point to when they [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=78.24s)]
*  talk about, you know, urging people to be calm about the polls and saying, let's just look at [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=82.0s)]
*  what people are doing, not what they're telling pollsters. And that includes voting in special [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=86.32s)]
*  elections, although of course pollsters will say that that's a different group of folks than show [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  up to vote in a general election, and more broadly donations. Now, the cash advantage here is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=94.72s)]
*  significant. You know, the broader ecosystem, including aligned PACs, it's about two to one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=100.16s)]
*  right now in terms of cash on hand for Biden versus those that are supporting Donald Trump. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=106.08s)]
*  And of course, some of Trump's cash is going to go to his legal fees. So there's a drain there [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=109.84s)]
*  that Biden just simply doesn't have. Overall, he's got more money. You know, he's got the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=115.76s)]
*  positive reviews off the speech and they're hoping that builds into momentum in these sort of key [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=121.44s)]
*  swing states, about half a dozen or so, John, that they're watching very closely. Pretty small [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=125.84s)]
*  electoral map this cycle. Deep, very, very small. Today he makes his first trip to New Hampshire [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=130.32s)]
*  nearly two years. It seems that they think the only state really they can flip might be North [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=135.04s)]
*  Carolina. And I said Biden meant him, but of course, Josh, Joe meant him. Sounds better. You [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  mentioned it is indeed a budget day. And to quote President Biden, he says something on the lines of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  like, show me your budget and I'll show you your priorities. It's a reflection of values and what [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  he wants to do. Tell us about what he's proposing. Yeah, he's talking about tax increases for [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=152.64s)]
*  corporations, including the rate, but also speaking to the minimum tax that they would pay, as well as [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=157.92s)]
*  for high earners. Of course, Biden has always said no tax increases for those making under 400 grand. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=163.84s)]
*  This will be one to look at. You know, we've got sort of a conversation coming, I guess I should say, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=168.72s)]
*  on taxes, both with respect to the Trump tax cuts that are about to expire. The next Congress and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  President will have to decide what to do about that. But more broadly, the deficit isn't in a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=179.12s)]
*  great place. And so that'll be sort of an increase in pressure. Biden's budget will show about three [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=183.2s)]
*  trillion in cumulative deficit reduction over a decade long period. That's compared to the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=188.0s)]
*  roughly 20 trillion that's expected to be added to the debt over that period. So it's, you know, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=193.36s)]
*  three trillion, big number, also a fraction of what the borrowing is estimated to be right now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  That's a big one. One other thing, John, is we've reported at Bloomberg on the sort of debate heading [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  up to this budget, real to and fro between what's called the Troika, the Treasury Secretary, the OMB [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=207.84s)]
*  director and the Council of Economic Advisers director, and Lail Brainard, the National Economic [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  Council director, who got into it a little bit over how to set the forecast for interest rates. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=219.04s)]
*  Brainard pushing for a lower rate. Our sources tell us she succeeded in getting a lower rate. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  That has the effect of sort of painting a little bit of a rosier picture today. Just goes to show, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=229.84s)]
*  you know, in the prep of this, rates were all over the place. The economy is doing a lot of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  weird things as sort of markets try to churn things out where we're at with inflation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=238.56s)]
*  There was a lot of debate heading into this one. So we'll be looking closely at how that forecast [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  looks. Yeah, we'll definitely be watching for that. And certainly the Biden administration will [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=247.6s)]
*  continue to point to strong fundamentals of this economy and some polling that suggests Americans [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=251.6s)]
*  starting to feel better. Now the trick is will they give the president credit? Great stuff as [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=257.04s)]
*  always from White House reporter for Bloomberg News, Josh Wingrove. Josh, come back soon. Thank [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=261.76s)]
*  you for being with us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMHu3YXc8oY&t=265.44s)]
