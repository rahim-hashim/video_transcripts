# President Biden issues federal death row commutations
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU)
*  President Joe Biden has announced this morning he will commute the sentences of more of most, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=0.0s)]
*  not all, but most of the 40 inmates on federal death row. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=7.44s)]
*  Now, Biden will be changing the death sentences to life without parole to all but three inmates, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=9.8s)]
*  the exceptions being the Boston bomber and the two men responsible for the mass shootings [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  at the Tree of Eden in Pittsburgh and the church in Charleston, South Carolina. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=21.1s)]
*  Advocates fighting against the death penalty, including Pope Francis, have been urging Biden [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=25.8s)]
*  to grant the commutations before Donald Trump, whose pro-capital punishment takes over in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=29.8s)]
*  January. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=34.56s)]
*  Biden wrote in a statement, make no mistake, I condemn these murderers, grieve for the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=35.56s)]
*  victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=40.04s)]
*  and irreparable loss. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=45.2s)]
*  I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=46.84s)]
*  level. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=51.32s)]
*  In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=52.32s)]
*  that I halted. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=56.64s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for Bloomberg, Skylar Woodhouse. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=57.88s)]
*  Skylar, thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=61.0s)]
*  How do you think this decision by President Biden reflects his final days in office and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  how will it fit into his overall legacy? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=67.88s)]
*  Yeah, this is the time of year where outgoing presidents are usually, you know, figuring [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=69.84s)]
*  out their pardons and what they're going to do in their final days. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=76.2s)]
*  And this comes only weeks after President Biden changed his mind on parting his own [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=79.6s)]
*  son, Hunter Biden. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, so these commutes are just in time for the new year and for the end of his presidency. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=85.44s)]
*  And it's really going to mark the final week's days of what he is planning to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=92.28s)]
*  His administration is already Trump-proofing for when President-elect Trump comes into [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=97.55999999999999s)]
*  office. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  So this is just another sort of checkmark that Biden and his administration is doing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  as they prepare to turn over the power to President-elect Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ_QGOBOGXU&t=108.52s)]
