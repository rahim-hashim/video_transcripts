# Fulton County DA to present election case this week
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0)
*  Remind the viewers out there if he's indicted in Atlanta this week as we're anticipating that he will be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=0.0s)]
*  We will have the front-runner for the Republican nomination for president out on bail in four different [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=6.22s)]
*  jurisdictions New York Miami [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Washington and Atlanta what I think Republican voters have to ask themselves is two things [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=16.2s)]
*  first is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=22.12s)]
*  Is he really the guy? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=24.12s)]
*  Under indictment in four different cases given the conduct that he committed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=26.6s)]
*  Someone who can beat Joe Biden or any other Democrat in November 2024 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=30.84s)]
*  And when are we gonna stop pretending that this is normal? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=35.64s)]
*  That of course is former New Jersey governor and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=40.88s)]
*  2024 White House hopeful Chris Christie weighing in on a possible fourth indictment of former President Donald Trump [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=44.0s)]
*  Joining us now political reporter for the Atlanta Journal Constitution [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=51.6s)]
*  Greg Bluestein he is also a contributor for NBC News and of course comes from us live in Georgia Greg great to see you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=55.8s)]
*  So we know that the DA is starting to present her case some witnesses have confirmed. They're coming in this week [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=63.08s)]
*  That surprised a few people the governor there. He was heard from them [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  They thought and he thought and others too that an indictment could come this week [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=72.2s)]
*  What's the latest you're hearing in terms of a timeline? Is that still? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=75.56s)]
*  Possibility or do we think it slipped a little bit? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=79.44000000000001s)]
*  No, we are circling Tuesday as the potential day where we could hear about an indictment [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  We have two days of grand jury testimony behind closed doors starting this morning at the Fulton County Courthouse [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=86.68s)]
*  And we know of at least four witnesses probably more who have been called to testify we have on the record now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=92.44s)]
*  That the former lieutenant governor Jeff Duncan and independent journalist George Chidi have both been called in to testify on Tuesday [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  So we expect an announcement as early as Tuesday evening about a potential indictment of not only Donald Trump, but also [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  Members of his close inner orbit and certainly if it ends up not being Tuesday it could be Wednesday Thursday later this week [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  So if that does happen, what are some charges that are possible? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  Against Trump and who else might face them? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=125.18s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking at a potential Rico charges involving Donald Trump and some of his allies [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  We know that finding Willis is a Rico expert [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=134.1s)]
*  She's used that law that state statute here in Georgia, which is more expansive than the federal one [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=136.62s)]
*  Successfully in Atlanta public schools cheating trial about a decade or go [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=141.86s)]
*  We also know that his her investigation has spread far beyond Donald Trump to members of the fake electors [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=145.46s)]
*  To supporters who went down to rule Georgia County called Coffee County to copy election data [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=151.7s)]
*  to other members of Donald Trump's legal circle inner circle including his former attorney Rudy Giuliani is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=158.02s)]
*  So we expect this to be a pretty broad and sweeping indictment if it actually comes out this week [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=164.06s)]
*  and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  We should note of course that this is a would be a state charge and in the hypothetical if Donald Trump were to return to the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=169.18s)]
*  White House he would not be able to attempt to self-pardon a state charge while he [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=175.66s)]
*  Possibly could a federal one. We'll see how that stands up in the courts though [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=180.26s)]
*  But Greg there's another branch of this election investigation and it's the alleged breach of the voting systems in Coffee County, Georgia [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=184.1s)]
*  There's been some new reporting about this in the last couple of days [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=191.26s)]
*  Tell us that ask more about that aspect of this investigation [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  The coffee county is a rural county in South Georgia very Republican. This is not a swing county [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=197.66s)]
*  This is not this was not a very competitive county whatsoever [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=202.98s)]
*  But what emerged after the election was that it was found that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  Several Trump a team of Trump supporters and data analysts went down to coffee counties board of elections [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=210.22s)]
*  They were spotted on surveillance video [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=215.5s)]
*  The visit was captured by surveillance and they copied election sensitive voting data election at an hour [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=218.58s)]
*  They spent hours behind closed doors there copying that data. We expect that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=224.94s)]
*  Infiltration to be a significant part of finding Willis's investigation [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=231.18s)]
*  It's just one facet of what we expect to be Rico charges that centers on Trump and his plot to undermine and overturn [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=234.82s)]
*  Joe Biden's election victory here in Georgia and we just saw some of the footage from Coffee County just now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=242.26s)]
*  significant week in the Fulton County, Georgia [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=248.22s)]
*  We're glad Greg Bluestein political reporter for the Atlanta Journal of Constitution could be with us as a preview [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=251.5s)]
*  We'll talk to you again on morning Joe a little later, and I'm sure a bunch this week [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=256.06s)]
*  You [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p26W_qdLmh0&t=277.38s)]
