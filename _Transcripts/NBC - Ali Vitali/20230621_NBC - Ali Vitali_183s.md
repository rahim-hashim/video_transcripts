# Democrats re-energize push for reproductive rights
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM)
*  Welcome back. Saturday will mark one year since the Supreme Court ended the federal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=0.0s)]
*  right to abortion in the United States. To note that anniversary, congressional Democrats [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=6.24s)]
*  are gearing up to take several steps toward enshrining reproductive rights into law. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=11.28s)]
*  According to Axios, House Democrats are currently working to force a floor vote on the Women's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=16.04s)]
*  Health Protection Act. If passed, the bill would codify at the federal level the right [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=22.36s)]
*  to an abortion before viability. Democrats will need six Republicans to bring the matter [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=27.98s)]
*  up for a vote. Now, Democrats in the Senate are expected to push for votes on four pieces [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=33.3s)]
*  of legislation that would codify the right to contraception into law, allow people to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=38.02s)]
*  travel across state lines to get abortions, and protect doctors who perform abortions [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  for patients from outside their own states. As of right now, neither measure is expected [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=47.78s)]
*  But as NBC News is reporting, Democrats are hoping to have the Republicans' views on reproductive [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=53.86000000000001s)]
*  rights on the record ahead of next year's elections. Joining us now, congressional [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=59.540000000000006s)]
*  reporter for the New Republic, Grace Segers-Grace. Great to see you this morning. I mean, the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=65.78s)]
*  issue of abortion obviously was a defining one in the 2022 midterms. It looms large right [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=70.22s)]
*  now with this anniversary on the horizon on the weekend. So walk us through just the both [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=77.0s)]
*  parties' political approach to what is clearly still going to be a hot button issue next year. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=81.98s)]
*  Exactly. So we saw that abortion was very critical in 2022. It was particularly a motivating [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=88.18s)]
*  factor for women. So we know that Democrats are hoping to capitalize once again on that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  momentum, hoping to reach out to women voters in particular to say, hey, we're trying to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=101.9s)]
*  do something in Congress, even if that something is getting blocked by Republicans. But they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=108.58s)]
*  and Democrat candidates are going to continue to press forward with this. Don't expect this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=114.66s)]
*  issue to go away before the 2024 elections. But Republicans are taking kind of a different [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=120.34s)]
*  route, particularly in Congress. They don't really want this to be talked about too much. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=126.62s)]
*  They have been avoiding the issue beyond just general platitudes about believing in anti-abortion [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=132.66s)]
*  or opposing abortion rights. So I think that for Democrats, they're very excited to capitalize [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=142.34s)]
*  on this issue going forward. Republicans would rather downplay it. It'll be really interesting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=148.3s)]
*  to see whether they try to press forward on the issue in terms of trying to pass federal [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=153.58s)]
*  restrictions or just keep their head down, which is what they've been doing so far. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNTmxtaPsdM&t=158.62s)]
