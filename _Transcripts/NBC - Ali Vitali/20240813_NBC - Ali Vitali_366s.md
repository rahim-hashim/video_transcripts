# FBI investigating effort to hack Trump, Biden campaigns
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw)
*  Welcome back. The FBI says it's investigating efforts to hack both the Trump and Biden campaigns. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=0.0s)]
*  A source familiar with the matter tells NBC News the investigation includes attempted [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=8.32s)]
*  hacks targeting three Biden campaign staffers, as well as Roger Stone, a former adviser to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=12.88s)]
*  Donald Trump. This comes after the Trump campaign said on Saturday that it had been hacked and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=18.76s)]
*  suggested that Iran was involved in stealing and distributing internal vetting documents [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=24.44s)]
*  on Senator JD Vance, Trump's now running mate. The Washington Post was first to report the FBI's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=29.8s)]
*  probe. According to the paper, the FBI began the investigation in June and suspected Iran was [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=35.64s)]
*  behind the attempts to steal data from the two campaigns. A Harris campaign official tells NBC [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=41.32s)]
*  that it did not appear to be a victim of any security breaches. Joining us now, White House [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=47.24s)]
*  reporter for the Washington Post, Tyler Pager. Morning, Tyler. Good to see you. So tell us a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  little more about what we know about these hack attempts. You know, the Post and Politico each [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=59.32s)]
*  were sent some of this JD Vance information, though most of it, to be clear, is publicly [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=64.84s)]
*  available things. We're not aware of any real sensitive material just yet. But tell us more [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=70.12s)]
*  about the probe and how the campaigns are responding. Yeah, I think we're still learning [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=74.68s)]
*  about this, obviously, in real time. This just is unfolding over the last few days, but obviously [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=79.32s)]
*  the FBI has been aware of this and the campaigns have been aware of it, about this for some time, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=83.8s)]
*  and just shows the fact that foreign actors continue to try to be involved and interfere [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  with American elections. Obviously, they were successful with the Trump campaign. We're still [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=93.88s)]
*  learning exactly what information they have gotten access to. As you said, right now, the scope of our [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  knowledge is that it's related to vetting documents for JD Vance, now Trump's running mate. The Biden [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=103.96s)]
*  campaign was made aware of this effort as well. It does not appear that that was successful. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=109.16s)]
*  But I think, you know, in conversations I've had over the last few days, at least on the Democratic [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=113.47999999999999s)]
*  side, after 2016, there have been massive efforts to try to bolster security across the Democratic [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=117.48s)]
*  ecosystem after they were successful in hacking into Hillary Clinton's emails. This is a subject [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=123.48s)]
*  of huge concerns for campaigns, and so they've taken extra security precautions. Clearly, the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  Democrats have been, to this point, successful in trying to rebut any of these efforts, but it shows [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=134.04s)]
*  just the continuing threat of foreign actors in American elections. No question. A major security [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  story and also a media story, as many were very critical of how the press handled those leaks. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=143.08s)]
*  Back in 2016, with the Clinton campaign. So let's turn elsewhere on the campaign front. The vice [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=147.48s)]
*  president had quite a couple of days ahead here, talk of an economic speech later this week, and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=153.64s)]
*  then of course the convention next week. Senior Democrats, you talked to, how do they feel right [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  now with Chicago looming? I think they feel as good as they could be. I think it's just been a [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=163.32s)]
*  remarkable few weeks with Kamala Harris able to really unite the Democratic Party in a way that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=168.83999999999997s)]
*  we haven't seen in years. And not just unite the Democratic Party, but excite the Democratic Party. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=174.04s)]
*  I mean, I was at her first rally with Governor Tim Walz in Philadelphia, and the energy there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=178.76s)]
*  was jubilant. And then she continued to travel around the country, and the crowds just kept [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=183.48s)]
*  getting bigger and bigger. And I think, you know, crowds do not translate into votes, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=187.48s)]
*  but they show a sense of excitement about the new ticket. And I think it's a reflection, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=192.04s)]
*  not necessarily of how much Democrats feel about Kamala Harris, but how excited they are that it's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=197.0s)]
*  not Joe Biden. We saw for months and months and months the Democratic Party telling pollsters, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=201.88s)]
*  telling journalists that they did not want it to be a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=207.0s)]
*  So you just think that change has brought a level of excitement that Democrats have been yearning [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=211.32s)]
*  for for years. And, you know, really putting to test this argument that Donald Trump has made for [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=215.4s)]
*  years about his crowd size, this is one of the things that he's been able to hold over Democrats, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  saying that he is able to bring more people into the election, excite people, get them out to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  rallies. And we have not seen that from Democrats for years. And so the fact that Kamala Harris has [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=230.28s)]
*  been able to do this in the battleground states, in the states that will decide this election, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=237.0s)]
*  I think Democrats are very excited. Obviously, there's still divisions in the party. We were [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=240.6s)]
*  just talking about expecting large protests in Chicago, but Democrats right now heading into [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=243.72s)]
*  the convention, feeling about as good as they could be. And no one will ever accuse Democrats [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=248.04s)]
*  of being overconfident, but certainly people are excited about the polls. We've seen they've [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=251.56s)]
*  certainly moved towards Harris, but this is still a very tight race within the margin of error in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=255.08s)]
*  most places. And there are still some issues that might favor Republicans, if that's what this [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=258.92s)]
*  election is about. That could be the economy, that could be immigration. Obviously, for Harris, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=264.6s)]
*  there's abortion rights, there's some of the foreign policy stuff could go either way. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  What are we in terms of those issues? Is it going to be an issues campaign or a vibes campaign? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=273.8s)]
*  What are people saying? It's a great question. I think that's one of the things that has benefited [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  Kamala Harris to this point is that she has not had to clearly define her policy proposals. There's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=282.20000000000005s)]
*  just been this excitement about this change, about the first black woman to lead a major party's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=286.92s)]
*  ticket, the addition of Tim Walz, who's excited the progressive base. And so I think we'll see in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=292.04s)]
*  the next few days and into the convention how she deals with the fact that she has not really laid [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=296.6s)]
*  out any policy. Her vision is not a substantive one at this point. It's largely based on rebutting [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump and bringing in this new sort of energy and excitement. So as we move into election, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=306.44s)]
*  I think that's one of the things that give Democrats some trepidation. If you look back [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=310.36s)]
*  to Harris's campaign in 2019 when she ran in the Democratic Party, one of the things she really [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=313.24s)]
*  got tripped up on was this policy, was the vision for the country. I think she benefits from this [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=317.72s)]
*  shortened election cycle and just sort of the contrast with Trump. But I think that is a big [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=322.6s)]
*  question as Harris heads into the fall is how much policy does she push forward and how much does she [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=327.64s)]
*  get pressed to really fill in the details of what a Harris administration would look like. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  She's certainly going to have to do that, but she's also going to be aided if Trump keeps [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=336.04s)]
*  imploding like he has been of late. Really good stuff this morning from White House reporter for [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=338.68s)]
*  the Washington Post, Tyler Pager. Tyler, thank you for coming in. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5pvnoB3zw&t=342.76s)]
