# Trump again compares himself to Nelson Mandela
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI)
*  Welcome back with precisely one week to go before his first criminal trial is set to begin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is once again comparing himself to Nelson Mandela [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=5.24s)]
*  In a three-page rant on social media over the weekend Trump railed against a judge overseeing the hush money trial for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=10.52s)]
*  Imposing a gag order on him last month [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=17.8s)]
*  Trump wrote this if this partisan hack wants me to put me in the clink for speaking the open and obvious truth [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=20.56s)]
*  I will gladly become a modern-day [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=27.4s)]
*  Nelson Mandela [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=31.04s)]
*  That gag order was imposed after Trump [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=32.56s)]
*  Repeatedly attacked the judge's daughter despite being warned not to do so also those close to Trump say he's actually [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=35.56s)]
*  terrified at the idea of spending time in jail and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=41.72s)]
*  Contrary to what he posted on truth social [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=44.84s)]
*  Joining us now Pulitzer Prize winning columnist and associate editor of the Washington Post as well as an MSNBC [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=47.2s)]
*  Political analyst our friend Eugene Robinson Eugene great to see you this morning. Thank you for joining us. So I mean [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=53.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is comparing himself to Nelson Mandela. It is beyond offensive [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=59.12s)]
*  Give us your analysis here. Is there any way at all? This will resonate with people outside of Trump's hardcore base [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=64.92s)]
*  No, I mean, you know it hardly needs to be said but I [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Met Nelson Mandela Donald Trump, you're no Nelson Mandela [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=78.72s)]
*  And it is such a ridiculous [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=83.64s)]
*  Comparison [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  That that I don't think it will present with anybody [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  except the mega base and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=93.4s)]
*  Why shouldn't we expect it to make the resident to resonate with the? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=95.68s)]
*  With the hardcore mega base because everything he says seems to resonate with them [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=101.4s)]
*  So, I guess that could be the next rallying cry [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=105.68s)]
*  Among the the I'm talking about the hardcore [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=110.92s)]
*  I'm not talking about people who are just gonna put the Trumpists. Maybe they don't like Biden's policies or whatever, but the hardcore mega base [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=114.56s)]
*  You know unbelievable, but they could see Donald Trump as a political prisoner at least a potential political prisoner [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=123.56s)]
*  If as the strong goes up and Trump of course has also compared himself to Jesus at times [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=131.76s)]
*  So Eugene, yeah [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  One of the great unknowns is the impact this criminal trial might have on the election [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  We have some analysts who believe that it will make no difference at all [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=145.84s)]
*  Some think it could actually fire up supporters of Republicans who think that Trump is being unfairly prosecuted others believe it'll totally turn off [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=150.04s)]
*  Swing voters and move move the race even just a few points which in a tight race might be enough for President Biden [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  Just give us give us your best guess. None of us know we've never been here before [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=164.42s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  It could be any or all of the above [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  I know there has been some polling over the months that suggested there are voters out there [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=173.06s)]
*  Who are inclined to vote for Trump, but who say they won't vote for him if he is convicted of a felony [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=179.38s)]
*  So if he gets convicted, you know, we'll see if those people are are serious about that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=186.52s)]
*  You know [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of Republicans who are kind of on the fence are kind of talking themselves into voting for Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  This shouldn't be a surprise [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=203.12s)]
*  We see that most Republicans to come home most Democrats to come home and then it'll be decided on them on the margins [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  I I still don't see how being [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=212.24s)]
*  on trial [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=215.9s)]
*  This spectacle we're gonna see and especially the prospect of being potentially convicted [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=217.78s)]
*  I just still don't see how that's a plus. I don't see that how that's a net plus for Donald Trump [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=223.62s)]
*  But you know, we'll have to see we've all been wrong about that before [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=230.46s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly this Manhattan case deemed less serious than some of the others that he may be facing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=235.94s)]
*  But it might be the only one that goes to trial before November [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=240.3s)]
*  So Eugene, let's talk about his opponent the president Biden [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=244.32s)]
*  He'll be in Wisconsin later today talking about student debt relief and it's squarely aimed at some of these young voters who poll [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=247.2s)]
*  Suggests he might be on the verge of losing we're talking about that dynamic [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=253.12s)]
*  There was some really good reporting this weekend from Politico that suggests that if polling is accurate and that's an if because polls have been [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=257.4s)]
*  Shaky in recent years. It's Biden showing surprising strength among older voters [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=263.84s)]
*  But struggling with young voters who will see if they go to Trump, but they might stay home [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=269.0s)]
*  Right, I'd be shocked if they went to Trump because Trump is offering them absolutely nothing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=275.28s)]
*  But they're clearly angry with Biden over a number of issues [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=281.4s)]
*  I think the biggest issue right now for many young voters is Gaza and the administration support for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=286.0s)]
*  Israel which a lot of younger voters see as [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=293.92s)]
*  necessarily uncritical and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=297.6s)]
*  I [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=299.68s)]
*  Think we should have a different policy student debt relief is also a big deal [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=300.88s)]
*  for a lot of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=306.48s)]
*  younger and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  increasingly for some middle-aged voters who are still [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=309.92s)]
*  Drowning in student debt. I believe this latest initiative [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=315.12s)]
*  The White House is saying could help up to 30 million people [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=320.24s)]
*  And so again, I don't think that can hurt I think it might help some [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  But I think Gaza is the bigger issue [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  Especially on campuses. So for example, if you're gonna win, Michigan got a win big in Lane County, Detroit [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=336.2s)]
*  You also got a win big in Washtenaw County, which is Ann Arbor [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=343.0s)]
*  And and right now I'd say, you know, he needs to shore up those numbers of Washington County [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  Maybe it'll still help. Yeah, it's really social media particularly tick-tock seems to be filled of anti-biden rhetoric right now, which may be also impacting [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=354.5s)]
*  Young voters, but certainly you're right. There's also the Trump's offering them nothing. There's also a chance polls may just be broken yet again [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=362.06s)]
*  This cycle you shall see Eugene Robinson terrific analysis. We really appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you and thank hey everyone [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZO8xKO_UI&t=368.78000000000003s)]
