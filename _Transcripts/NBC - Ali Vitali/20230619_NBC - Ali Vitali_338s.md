# Pence refuses to say if he would pardon Trump
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU)
*  Former Vice President and 2024 presidential candidate Mike Pence was on Meet the Press [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=0.0s)]
*  yesterday during which he criticized Donald Trump and talked about whether or not he would [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=7.4s)]
*  pardon Trump if the former president was convicted of a federal crime. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=13.36s)]
*  I just think the question is premature. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=19.44s)]
*  I think we need to let the courts do their job and let this case work its way through [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=23.04s)]
*  our judicial system. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=30.6s)]
*  And if I have the great privilege of being president of the United States, as I did when [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=31.6s)]
*  I was a governor, we would value any request for pardon for any American. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=36.0s)]
*  If you were President Biden, would you pardon him right now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  I just think this whole matter is incredibly divisive for the country. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=47.08s)]
*  Look, in 2016, Donald Trump promised to govern as a conservative. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  And I'm proud to say that we did for four years under the Trump-Pence administration. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=58.92s)]
*  But he makes no such promise today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=65.2s)]
*  Not only has he been walking away from a clear commitment to the right to life, but look, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=67.0s)]
*  we have a national debt the size of our nation's economy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=75.36s)]
*  Joe Biden's policy is insolvency. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=78.56s)]
*  He won't even talk about the 70 percent of the federal budget that represents entitlements [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=80.68s)]
*  that's driving that debt. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Even if President Trump wanted to talk about it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's position on the national debt is identical to Joe Biden's. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=90.56s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=97.04s)]
*  Julia, thanks for being here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  So Pence appears to be walking a tightrope when it comes to Donald Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=104.04s)]
*  He has been critical of him on a few matters, including, of course, January 6th. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  We just heard some of it there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=113.56s)]
*  I'll meet the press yesterday. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=115.16s)]
*  But of course, he is so closely aligned with Trump, so associated with Trump for four years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=117.0s)]
*  How, the people you talk to in Pence World, how do they see him navigating this going forward? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, Jonathan, it's similar to the strategy, it seems, that Ron DeSantis' campaign is taking. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=128.6s)]
*  You know, these two men are very similar to Donald Trump when it comes to their platforms [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=134.28s)]
*  and policies, but they need to differentiate themselves. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=138.96s)]
*  And obviously, Vice President Pence needs to, because essentially him and Trump are sort of running on the same record. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  So in that clip, you heard Mike Pence talk about President Trump's, I guess, stance on abortion post his presidency. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=148.96s)]
*  And that's something you're going to see, I think, a lot of these other candidates try to take a shot at Donald Trump over. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=158.96s)]
*  We know that abortion access or anti-abortion measures are very important to Republican primary voters, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=165.0s)]
*  particularly Republican caucus voters in Iowa. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=171.76s)]
*  So that's going to be very key, I think, in painting Donald Trump as not necessarily a conservative. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=175.2s)]
*  And for someone like Mike Pence, someone who's very closely aligned with evangelical voters and grassroots conservative voters, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=181.56s)]
*  that's going to be pretty easy for him to do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=188.11999999999998s)]
*  The problem is, though, how well does that play in states that aren't maybe Iowa or South Carolina? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=190.68s)]
*  How does that play in a New Hampshire that might be a bit more libertarian, for example, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=196.52s)]
*  and more pro-choice in how Republicans look at this issue of abortion? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  So I think that's going to be issue number one there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=206.36s)]
*  So we heard Pence get asked about the possibility of a pardon for Donald Trump. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  I'll give you a spoiler right now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=213.96s)]
*  President Biden is not going to preemptively pardon him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=215.84s)]
*  We can set that one aside. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=218.16s)]
*  But it's become this sort of test, if you will, for a lot of the other Republican candidates, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=220.0s)]
*  like to figure out how they respond. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=223.96s)]
*  But I think some of them, and tell us what you're hearing, Julia, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=226.4s)]
*  are also using it as a bit of an opportunity when asked this question. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=229.52s)]
*  So tell us, how is the field discussing the possibility of a Trump pardon? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=232.8s)]
*  Well, if you want to talk about tightropes, this is definitely one where they're walking a tightrope. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=237.4s)]
*  I mean, look, you have Vice President Pence not exactly answering that question, trying to play it safe. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=242.28s)]
*  Ron DeSantis, same thing, saying that he would aggressively use pardons during his administration, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=248.44s)]
*  but we don't know exactly how he'd feel about Trump in particular. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=254.12s)]
*  For someone like Vivek Ramaswamy, though, he was the one who started this talk about pardons last week [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=257.96s)]
*  when he had that press conference and urged the other 2024 contenders to pledge to pardon Trump. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=263.76s)]
*  It's just such an awkward situation for a lot of these Republican candidates, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=269.96s)]
*  because this is an area where you would think Trump would be vulnerable on this topic. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=274.04s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is, Republicans I talked to say that this idea or this feeling [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=280.24s)]
*  that there is a double standard against Republicans coming from the FBI in the Justice Department [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=286.36s)]
*  is a belief that is very well held or very tightly held by many Republican primary and caucus voters. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=292.28s)]
*  So it's something that I think you're going to hear potentially more candidates talk about [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=299.68s)]
*  in order to appeal to those voters while at the same time not necessarily saying they're Team Trump. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=304.88s)]
*  The Hills, Julia Manchester, with some terrific reporting for us this morning. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=312.76s)]
*  Thank you for joining. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-nKifQiQU&t=315.76s)]
