# Police clear Columbia building occupied by protesters
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM)
*  We'll begin this morning with the NYPD clearing a Columbia University building that was seized [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=0.0s)]
*  by protesters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=5.66s)]
*  Dozens of officers arrived on campus late last night wearing riot gear. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  They used a ramp to get inside Hamilton Hall, the main academic building, which was occupied [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=11.76s)]
*  by protesters overnight on Monday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=16.82s)]
*  Video shows special police units entering the building through a second-story window. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=19.86s)]
*  Officers say about 40 people were arrested inside. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=25.34s)]
*  The university released these images of the damage and vandalism inside Hamilton Hall. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=29.12s)]
*  You can see overturned chairs and furniture, some broken windows, and smashed panes of glass. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=35.72s)]
*  In a statement, the university explains it made the decision to call the police after [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=41.66s)]
*  consulting with security experts and the board of trustees. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=46.5s)]
*  The statement reads in part this way. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=49.84s)]
*  The decision to reach out to the NYPD was in response to the actions of the protesters, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=52.22s)]
*  not the cause they are championing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=56.94s)]
*  We have made it clear that the life of campus cannot be endlessly interrupted by protesters [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=59.66s)]
*  who violate the rules and the law. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=64.98s)]
*  The university says it believes the group that broke into the building was led by individuals [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=68.17999999999999s)]
*  who are not affiliated with Columbia. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=72.74s)]
*  In total, police last night arrested nearly 100 people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  They also cleared out the encampment that had been up for about two weeks there on campus. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=80.96s)]
*  Now, the university is asking the NYPD to stay at the school, to stay on campus until [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  May 17th, which is two days after Columbia's upcoming commencement ceremonies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=91.26s)]
*  Additionally, police also cleared an encampment at the City College of New York, which is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  just a few blocks north from Columbia, also there in Upper Manhattan. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  Officers say they helped the school, quote, restore order on campus. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=107.7s)]
*  25 protesters were arrested there. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=112.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, out west, at UCLA, pro-Palestinian protesters continued to clash overnight with [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  Israel's supporters. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  Because of the violence, the university has declared the pro-Palestinian encampments illegal. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=123.05999999999999s)]
*  The LAPD have now been called to help stop the unrest. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_aJHAcf-mM&t=129.73999999999998s)]
