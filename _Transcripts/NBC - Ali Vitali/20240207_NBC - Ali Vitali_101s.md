# Haley loses to 'None of These Candidates' in Nevada
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A)
*  Meanwhile, after facing virtually no opposition, President Joe Biden easily won the Nevada [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=0.0s)]
*  Democratic primary last night, putting him one step closer to formally securing the party's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=5.08s)]
*  nomination for an expected rematch this fall against Donald Trump. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=9.72s)]
*  Challenger Congressman Dean Phillips entered the race too late to even get on the state's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=13.84s)]
*  ballot, leaving Marianne Williamson as the only other candidate in the contest. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=17.96s)]
*  The next Democratic primary is scheduled for February 27th in Michigan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, it was a disappointing night in Nevada for Republican presidential candidate [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=27.52s)]
*  Nikki Haley. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  The former South Carolina governor finished behind none of these candidates in the presidential [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=32.96s)]
*  primary, in which Trump didn't even bother to participate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=40.739999999999995s)]
*  The outcome in Nevada is now Haley's third consecutive loss in an early state primary [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=44.68s)]
*  contest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=48.84s)]
*  Still, her campaign says her results in Nevada won't affect how long she stays in the race, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=49.84s)]
*  with her focus now aimed at South Carolina and beyond. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=55.4s)]
*  Trump wasn't on the same ballot as Haley since he's opted to compete in the Nevada caucuses [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=59.04s)]
*  instead, which are set to take place tomorrow and puts him on the path to claim all of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=63.96s)]
*  state's 26 delegates. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=69.28s)]
*  The Haley team has been consistent in saying Trump basically rigged the outcome in Nevada [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=70.8s)]
*  and they barely participated. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=74.76s)]
*  Still, another loss, but one that's probably not going to matter much in the trajectory [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=76.32s)]
*  of the race. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZalW3afBj4A&t=80.08s)]
