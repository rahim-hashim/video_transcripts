# Tuberville questions Pentagon on 'abortion after birth'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc7FpCyfAM)
*  Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville just gave a reason as to why he is blocking hundreds of military promotions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc7FpCyfAM&t=0.0s)]
*  Hear what he believes the women in the military may try to do under the Pentagon's current abortion policy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc7FpCyfAM&t=8.28s)]
*  It's been rape, incest, or health of the mom, but we asked in one of our hearings, what month are you going to go by for the abortion? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc7FpCyfAM&t=15.92s)]
*  They couldn't tell us whether it was abortion after birth. I mean, these people can't communicate. They have no clue what they're doing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc7FpCyfAM&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  They're just throwing something out there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc7FpCyfAM&t=37.8s)]
*  The senator said there was a concern about abortion after birth. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc7FpCyfAM&t=39.44s)]
