# Trump to testify Monday in $250M civil fraud trial
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c)
*  Welcome back. Donald Trump is scheduled to take the stand today in his $250 million New [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=0.0s)]
*  York civil fraud trial. Testimony just how much news we have today. We're only getting [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=8.52s)]
*  to this story now. The former president will have to defend his actions as head of the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=12.44s)]
*  Trump Organization and deny allegations that he ordered his subordinates to falsify financial [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=16.72s)]
*  records and inflate his wealth. The New York Times reported that Trump is deeply personally [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=22.64s)]
*  enraged by this trial and by the fact that his children, adult children, have had to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=27.86s)]
*  testify. That's per several people who have spoken with him. And he may not be able to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=33.1s)]
*  restrain himself on the stand. We've seen that before. Ivanka Trump will be the final [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=38.28s)]
*  member of the family to take the stand. That's slated for later this week, but Donald Trump [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=43.3s)]
*  just a few hours from now. Joining us at this moment, MSNBC justice and legal affairs analyst [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=47.34s)]
*  Anthony Coley. He was most recently the top spokesman at the Department of Justice under [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=52.86s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland. Anthony, great to see you this morning. So yeah, we [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=58.46s)]
*  certainly can see the former president's anger about this trial. There's been reports that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=62.7s)]
*  he spent the weekend hold up for practice sessions. You know, we know he is, shall we [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=67.22s)]
*  say, unpredictable when asked to take the stand. What do you think we'll hear from him [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=72.5s)]
*  today? Is he going to just hide behind the fifth or is he going to engage? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=76.78s)]
*  I think because he has already been found liable for fraud, his testimony today will [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=80.46s)]
*  try to further lay the groundwork for a successful appeal and to get whatever political benefit [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=86.42s)]
*  he can. But I want to be clear, Jonathan, this is a big day for Donald Trump. He will [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=92.78s)]
*  be both under oath and under fire. In terms of a question of what do we expect to hear [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=97.34s)]
*  today, if his deposition is any indication, I think we'll hear two things. We'll hear [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=102.42s)]
*  him talk about this. It wasn't me defense. We heard this last week from Don from Don [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=107.22000000000001s)]
*  Jr., from Eric Trump, where they hire experts to advise them on things that experts have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=112.42s)]
*  an expertise in. And number two, we'll hear him talk about real estate valuations and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=118.34s)]
*  how that is more of an art and not a science. And there is some truth to that to an extent, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  right? Even the best good faith estimates must be rooted in hard facts. You can't just [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=128.62s)]
*  say that your penthouse is 33,000 square feet when it's actually 10,996 square feet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=135.46s)]
*  So I think that's what we'll hear from him inside the courtroom. Outside the courtroom [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=142.58s)]
*  is going to be more of the same. It's going to be him trying to rally his base. It's going [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=147.02s)]
*  to be him fundraising. And it's going to be him trying to paint this as a political prosecution [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=152.34s)]
*  and prosecution from a woke judge or from a woke prosecutor advised judge. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=159.1s)]
*  So you just laid out very well what Trump hopes to accomplish today. What do we think [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  prosecutors are hoping to do? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=170.06s)]
*  Yeah. So what I love about what Attorney General Tish James is doing is that she is focused [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=171.34s)]
*  solely on facts and the law, and she's got the receipts to prove it. And I think to your [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=177.38s)]
*  earlier question, and you acutely zoomed in on this, right? Trump is known to be brash. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=182.46s)]
*  He is known to be confident. And I think if I'm a prosecutor, I'm going to let him talk. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=190.22s)]
*  I'm going to let him talk for as long as he wants to talk. I'm reminded of the E. Jean [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=195.62s)]
*  Carroll case where in that deposition, prosecutors just let him talk and talk and talk. And then [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=200.9s)]
*  where he says, unfortunately, when you're a star, you can touch women inappropriately [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=207.46s)]
*  anyway. So that's what happens when you let him talk. And I suspect that's what she's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=214.46s)]
*  going to do today. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=217.9s)]
*  He has been known to get himself in trouble. And I do think it is. I know it's just a civil [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=218.9s)]
*  trial, but still remarkable. The former president of the United States on the stand today had [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=223.06s)]
*  a preview of what's to come potentially next year. MSNBC Justice and Legal Affairs analyst [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=226.82s)]
*  terrific stuff from Anthony Coley this morning. We appreciate him coming in. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3gfSx-X6c&t=231.70000000000002s)]
