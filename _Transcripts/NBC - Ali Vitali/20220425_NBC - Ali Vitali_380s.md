# Putin Reportedly Gives Up On Peace Talks
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw)
*  As the war in Ukraine enters its third month, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=0.0s)]
*  lost all interest in diplomatic efforts to end the violence. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=7.04s)]
*  Three people briefed on conversations with Putin tell the Financial Times that after [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=10.8s)]
*  seriously considering peace talks to end the war earlier this month after a series of military [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=15.0s)]
*  setbacks, the Russian president has now given up on those discussions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=19.88s)]
*  One person tells the Times, quote, Putin sincerely believes the nonsense he hears on Russian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=24.36s)]
*  television and he wants to win big. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=29.24s)]
*  Sources say the turning point for Putin was the sinking of Russia's largest warship in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=32.08s)]
*  the Black Sea, which reportedly left him humiliated. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=36.28s)]
*  Joining us now, news director for New Line magazine, investigative journalist Michael [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=40.44s)]
*  Weiss. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=44.839999999999996s)]
*  Michael, great to see you again. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=45.84s)]
*  Let's just start there about this idea of peace talks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=46.84s)]
*  They were great, received with a lot of skepticism all along, but we did hear some reports from [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=50.08s)]
*  Ukrainians and other third party countries that there seemed like there might have been [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=55.36s)]
*  a there there a while ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=58.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=59.86s)]
*  And we've stopped hearing about it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=60.86s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, in the first week, Putin or his emissaries were suing for some kind [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=61.86s)]
*  of diplomatic solution to this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=65.58s)]
*  I think they realized that their plan to do regime change in Kiev was going off the rails [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=67.42s)]
*  very quickly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=71.04s)]
*  They sent in their VDV paratroopers, they sent in their GRU Spetsnaz. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=72.18s)]
*  They could not sack the capital as had been anticipated. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  But all of that's now kind of dissipated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  In fact, I mean, forget about the sinking of the Moskva today or last night. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=81.38s)]
*  There was a huge explosion in Bryansk in Russia, about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=85.86s)]
*  Everyone on Twitter, all the military analysts I'm talking to are saying this is a Ukrainian [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=92.46s)]
*  missile struck a fuel depot. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  Actually was two missiles and two strikes inside Russian Federation territory. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  And this would not be the first act of sabotage the Ukrainians have allegedly conducted behind [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=102.0s)]
*  enemy lines. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=106.82s)]
*  Look, you know, this is a guy he started an unprovoked war. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=107.82s)]
*  He could not achieve his objectives. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  The new reset strategic objectives. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=114.26s)]
*  Let's take the Donbass. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=116.30000000000001s)]
*  Let's occupy more territory. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=117.48s)]
*  Let's have a land bridge connecting Crimea to Russia. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  That's not going to go so swimmingly either. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  People who are very gung ho about Russia's campaign to annihilate the Ukrainian military [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  are now basically arguing that they don't have enough troops, that the troops that they [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=129.26s)]
*  have do not have the military capability to achieve these objectives. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=133.34s)]
*  So I'm very curious to know what Putin thinks he can achieve. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=137.26s)]
*  Reading that piece, what I took from it is, yeah, he believes his own propaganda. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=141.1s)]
*  He thinks he's winning when he's losing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=144.73999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  Now, if you're in the West, you think, well, that's actually quite beneficial to us because [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  if we keep arming Ukraine, if they press this fight, I mean, I think Lloyd Austin, defense [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=149.98s)]
*  secretary has said we want to help them win and we want to help them degrade the Russian [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=154.98s)]
*  military to such an extent that they cannot conduct an operation like this again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=158.78s)]
*  To really weaken Russia going forward. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=162.22s)]
*  There certainly have been a number of explosions behind the borders of Mother Russia in recent [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=164.14s)]
*  weeks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=168.9s)]
*  You started to go there. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  The next phase here, the sense that the Donbass is going to be the target now and then they've [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=171.46s)]
*  increased the shelling. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  The land invasion really hasn't begun just yet. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  I reported over the weekend that that May 9th Victory Day, that the U.S. officials don't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=181.34s)]
*  believe there's going to be any significant escalation around that, although they think [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=186.86s)]
*  Putin might claim some sort of hollow victory, at least hollow progress report. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  How do you see the next couple of weeks playing out? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=194.26s)]
*  I mean, look, the big story here is that what Ukraine has been suing for for a long, long [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=195.9s)]
*  time, which is to become a kind of NATO capable military, they're now getting that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=200.38000000000002s)]
*  They're meeting that objective. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=208.22000000000003s)]
*  The United States, France, Italy, for Christ's sake, are sending long range artillery systems. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  They are upgrading their capacity from it used to be the Soviet era kit was 152 millimeter [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  caliber shells, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  Which they're running out of throughout Europe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=223.8s)]
*  Bulgaria has them, but very few countries still have them. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=226.0s)]
*  So now Ukraine is getting 155 millimeter caliber shells, which is basically the NATO standard. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=228.84s)]
*  They're becoming an almost NATO peer army in the midst of all of this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  This is bad news for Russia. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  Russia is not just suffering from a manpower shortage. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=240.0s)]
*  They're also suffering from a firepower shortage, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=243.16000000000003s)]
*  I spoke to the Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine last week, told me a very interesting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  statistic. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=250.12s)]
*  Of all the things that have been sort of shot into the air that we have taken down, cruise [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  missiles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, 90% of the guts of these munitions, the electronics [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=255.68s)]
*  are manufactured in two places. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Guess where? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=264.92s)]
*  The United States and Europe, right? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=265.92s)]
*  Dual use electronics. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=267.52s)]
*  Sanctions are going to have a big, big impact on Russia's ability to restock and resupply [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=269.32s)]
*  itself. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=273.2s)]
*  So again, I don't see how they do what they want to do. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=274.2s)]
*  They might have minimal gains. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  They might make some tactical victories here and there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=278.38s)]
*  Take a village, take a settlement. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=280.6s)]
*  But we've seen Mariupol has not fallen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=282.12s)]
*  And the size of the Vostol metallurgical facility is actually quite big. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=284.88s)]
*  It's four square miles. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=290.56s)]
*  I saw somebody do a comparison analysis of all the cities in the world superimposing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=292.72s)]
*  this metallurgical facility on top of. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=297.48s)]
*  It's quite a large, it's almost the size of a city. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=299.96s)]
*  So if they can't take Mariupol, how do they do this land bridge connecting Crimea? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=302.56s)]
*  And I think that's an important point. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=306.28s)]
*  As much as the Russians will be in force, the Donbass, so will the Ukrainians. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=307.32s)]
*  Michael Weiss, one of the leading voices on the war. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=311.36s)]
*  He's been to Ukraine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=313.24s)]
*  He will again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=314.24s)]
*  We really appreciate you being here with us again today. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=315.24s)]
*  Coming up next on Morning Joe, we'll go back to the highest level American visit to Ukraine [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=317.4s)]
*  as Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visit Kiev to meet [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=321.92s)]
*  with President Zelensky. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=327.32s)]
*  We'll discuss the extraordinary wartime visit with Admiral James Tsouridis and General Steph [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  Twitty and Barry McCaffrey. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  Plus the latest headlines dominating politics back here at home. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=335.88s)]
*  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy goes out of his way to make sure he and Donald [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=340.68s)]
*  Trump are still pals after leaked audio exposed McCarthy's true feelings about the former [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=344.72s)]
*  president after January 6th. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  Morning Joe, just a few moments away. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4jIILCVEw&t=352.6s)]
