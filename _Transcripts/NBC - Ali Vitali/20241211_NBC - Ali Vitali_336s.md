# Speaker Johnson predicts 'smooth' transition
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q)
*  Look, we have a unified conference. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I've talked with every single individual at great length and all of us collectively are [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=3.44s)]
*  ready to take using our football metaphor to take this proverbial football and run it [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=7.8s)]
*  right back up the field. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=12.52s)]
*  And to do that, you've got to have cohesion in your team and you've got to have all that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=13.84s)]
*  predetermined and it is so I think we'll have a smooth election of speaker because we don't [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=17.48s)]
*  have any time to waste. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=23.64s)]
*  That's how speaker Mike Johnson predicted a smooth transition during a sit down interview [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  that aired last night on Fox News. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=29.7s)]
*  Joining us now, managing editor at the Bullwork, Sam Stein. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=32.38s)]
*  Sam seems like the speaker not particularly comfortable with football analogies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=36.42s)]
*  Also, yeah, no kidding it's going to be a smooth transition. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=40.3s)]
*  Donald Trump's not the one contesting the election results this time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=44.18s)]
*  But talk to us, if you will, just about where Washington is right now, just a little over [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=48.34s)]
*  a month until Trump takes power again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=53.3s)]
*  You don't think there's going to be a riot on January 6th this time around? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=56.78s)]
*  Look, everyone in the city is, the city is very anxious, let's put it that way. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=60.38s)]
*  On the one hand, Democrats recognize that they are in a bad spot, but you don't really [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=66.42s)]
*  see much in the way of oppositional governance right now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=71.7s)]
*  They've been watching, especially in the Senate, as a parade of these controversial nominees [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=76.18s)]
*  are considered and as Republicans sort of try to figure out if they have the votes necessary [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=81.14s)]
*  to pass them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=86.62s)]
*  Now, the expectation from our latest reporting is that they will get passed, but it's not [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=87.62s)]
*  going to be smooth despite the hackneyed football analogy that the speaker had. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=92.3s)]
*  And then going forward, the question is, OK, well, what does January 20th look like? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  How much is that deportation force that Trump and his allies promised going to sweep through [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=102.5s)]
*  cities or will it be more targeted? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=107.18s)]
*  What will House Republicans and Congressional Republicans and Senate Republicans do with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=109.86s)]
*  respect to the expiring Trump tax cuts? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=113.42s)]
*  What will they do with border security legislation? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=116.3s)]
*  So there's a lot of outstanding questions, but everyone's ready and eager and anxious [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=118.86s)]
*  if you're Democrats for what should be fairly sweeping change. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  Sam, I want to get your take on a truth social post that Trump put up yesterday offering [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=127.22s)]
*  incentives like speedy permit approvals for businesses that invest a billion dollars or [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=132.14s)]
*  more in the U.S. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=136.94s)]
*  I mean, that feels like almost borderline pay for play, no? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=138.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the question is, can he do it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  Will there be lawsuits that require judges to intervene that say, hey, no, there's actually [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=146.94s)]
*  environmental laws on the books? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=152.38s)]
*  Obviously, the EPA itself under Trump won't be the one forcing the issue if this is the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=153.82s)]
*  case. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=158.66s)]
*  But I think you get to a bigger issue, which is, you know, this is the type of thing where [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=159.66s)]
*  you're saying essentially, hey, to high bidders who want to come and invest here, we'll give [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  you sweetheart deals. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=167.7s)]
*  This is kind of a more pervasive type of corruption than we've seen. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  The other thing that happened yesterday, which is of a similar genre, is that House Republicans, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=172.82s)]
*  they're going to have the retreat. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=177.94s)]
*  They do this every Congress. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=178.94s)]
*  But instead of doing it in nearby West Virginia, they're going to go down to Florida and they're [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  going to do it at the Derral Country Club, which is, as you know, owned by the Trump [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=185.22s)]
*  family. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=189.34s)]
*  That's the type of thing that in 2017 would have had a lot of pushback, a lot of howls, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=190.34s)]
*  a lot of opposition saying, look, you're using government officials to profit personally. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=195.18s)]
*  This go around, we're sort of calloused and there's very little in the way of people saying, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=201.66s)]
*  whoa, that's not right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=206.5s)]
*  That's ethically dubious. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=207.62s)]
*  Yeah, you could not be more right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=208.62s)]
*  Thank you for underscoring that, Sam. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=210.14s)]
*  And then in that genre, presidents don't fire FBI directors. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=211.78s)]
*  When Trump fired James Comey, it almost brought his presidency down. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=216.66s)]
*  And yet here it is, he's talking openly with zero pushback that Christopher Wray is going [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=220.9s)]
*  to be ousted. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=225.02s)]
*  Mind you, Christopher Wray, his appointee to be replaced by Cash Patel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=226.02s)]
*  Are you seeing any Republican resistance at all to that or to Patel's choice? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=229.9s)]
*  Oh, just the opposite. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  In fact, you know, Chuck Grassley, the senior most senator, wrote a letter to Chris Wray [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  yesterday saying, hey, your time's up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=241.06s)]
*  Without any indication that he was worried about Cash Patel and has noted a history of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  saying he wants to target journalists and political foes of Donald Trump. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=249.06s)]
*  So, no, if anything, Republicans are saying this is just sort of standard business now, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=252.66s)]
*  even though it's a 10 year term, that's the ceiling. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not the floor. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  And on top of that, and this is kind of the weird, almost scary talking from him, is that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=261.94s)]
*  Donald Trump deserves the FBI director of his choice. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=267.74s)]
*  That's actually not true. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=270.86s)]
*  The FBI director's term is 10 years for a reason. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=272.62s)]
*  So the president doesn't have to get or doesn't get the opportunity for FBI FBI director of his or her choice. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=275.66s)]
*  And so Washington's changed. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=281.7s)]
*  I mean, it's just changed. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=283.62s)]
*  And the first Trump administration, when there were areas of pushback and concern and protest, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=285.14s)]
*  frankly, you're not seeing that now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=291.94s)]
*  Now, it could change, obviously. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=293.46s)]
*  We have some time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  But I would be it would be unexpected, let's put it that way, to see a huge march, for [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=297.06s)]
*  instance, the day after Trump's inauguration. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=301.82s)]
*  And again, Christopher Wray was his choice. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=304.06s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=306.18s)]
*  That's not what the FBI director post is supposed to be about. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=307.42s)]
*  And Sam, you couldn't, I couldn't agree more with everything you've said about how Washington has changed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=309.66s)]
*  No, it's a rare moment here, to be sure. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVTaog4LQ3Q&t=314.1s)]
