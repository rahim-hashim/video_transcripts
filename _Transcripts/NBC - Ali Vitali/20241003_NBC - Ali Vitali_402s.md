# Trump on Haitian migrants: 'They have to be removed'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk)
*  In an interview he gave with News Nation last night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=0.0s)]
*  former President Donald Trump said that if he wins in November, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=2.52s)]
*  he would revoke the temporary protective status granted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  to Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=9.92s)]
*  In Springfield, what's happening there is horrible. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=14.16s)]
*  You have a beautiful community, 52,000 people, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=17.44s)]
*  and about 30,000 people were put into that community rapidly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=20.92s)]
*  And the community is so nice, and they [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=27.2s)]
*  want to be so politically correct. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=28.88s)]
*  You have to remove the people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=31.08s)]
*  You cannot destroy it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=33.08s)]
*  We cannot destroy our country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=34.16s)]
*  You had a beautiful, safe community. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=36.16s)]
*  Everyone's in love with everybody. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=38.32s)]
*  Everything was nice. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=40.04s)]
*  It was like a picture community. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=41.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, in a short period of time, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=42.88s)]
*  they have 32,000 more people in there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=44.72s)]
*  They are, in my opinion, it's not legal. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=47.2s)]
*  It's not legal for anybody to do. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=49.56s)]
*  It's not even on a human basis. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=51.56s)]
*  It's not acceptable to the people that are there [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=53.28s)]
*  and certainly to the people that are in Springfield. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Springfield is such a beautiful place. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=60.64s)]
*  Have you seen what's happened to it? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=62.4s)]
*  It's been overrun. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  You can't do that to people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=65.52s)]
*  They have to be removed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=67.28s)]
*  Let's be clear what this is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump is saying he's going to deport legal immigrants. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=71.28s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=75.52s)]
*  Mike, thanks for being here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=78.8s)]
*  So let's talk about Trump's rhetoric on immigration. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=79.96s)]
*  I mean, most of what he said there [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  is not true. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=85.64s)]
*  And despite being told by fellow Republicans, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=86.76s)]
*  including the Republican governor of Ohio, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=88.84s)]
*  he just will not let up his relentless bashing, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=91.2s)]
*  relentless and frankly racist bashing of these immigrants. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, when you were showing, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=98.56s)]
*  we were showing that clip that we just saw [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=99.64s)]
*  and listened to it, it causes me again to wonder [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=101.84s)]
*  how many people, how many Americans are out there [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=105.48s)]
*  who are going to shrug their shoulders and say, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=108.48s)]
*  you know what, I'm exhausted. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=110.28s)]
*  This guy is exhausting me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  This guy has been impeached twice. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=114.64s)]
*  This guy has been adjudicated a rapist by a New York judge. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=117.64s)]
*  This guy is a felon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=122.44s)]
*  He's got five or six felony counts against him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=123.88s)]
*  This guy cannot tell the truth. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=127.2s)]
*  This guy twists everything, a reality [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=129.88s)]
*  into something of his own concoction. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=132.6s)]
*  I can't do it anymore. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=135.44s)]
*  I'm not going to vote for him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=136.52s)]
*  I voted for him in 16 or say they voted for him in 20. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=137.68s)]
*  How many Americans are out there saying, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=141.16s)]
*  no, I want to talk about my children going forward. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=143.56s)]
*  Their schools, the safety of the schools. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=147.04s)]
*  I want to talk about grocery prices. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=149.96s)]
*  I want to talk about gas prices. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=152.12s)]
*  I do not want to listen to him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I think the exhaustion factor is real [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=155.48s)]
*  and sort of the Harris campaign hopes [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=158.36s)]
*  it permeates the ballot box. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=160.44s)]
*  At the same time, polls suggest that nearly half the country [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=162.68s)]
*  still on board with this and that Donald Trump [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=165.96s)]
*  has a one in two chance of winning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=167.68s)]
*  What does that say about who we are? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's a great question, Jonathan. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=171.32s)]
*  And I keep thinking that 10, 20 years from now, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=173.52s)]
*  when historians try to capture this period of time [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=176.28s)]
*  politically and culturally, what happened in this country, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  they're going to look at what has happened [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=183.0s)]
*  and what is happening right in front of us, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=185.48s)]
*  in front of all of us right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=187.48s)]
*  And they'll say, what was wrong with those people? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=188.92s)]
*  What did they did not see? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  What did they did not recognize? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  It's such an indictment. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=196.04s)]
*  Let's move, speaking of potential indictments, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=197.72s)]
*  let's talk about Jack Smith. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=200.2s)]
*  Yesterday, unsealing a filing that had a lot of new details [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=202.24s)]
*  about Trump's conduct on his efforts [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=206.44s)]
*  to overturn the 2020 election and his conduct on January 6th, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=209.28s)]
*  particularly when it comes to Mike Pence, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=212.4s)]
*  when he seemed that he was completely unmoved, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=214.72s)]
*  that his vice president's life was in danger. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=217.8s)]
*  Does this qualify as an October surprise? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=221.16s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=225.24s)]
*  I think it qualifies as recognizing that Judge Chutkin [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=226.48s)]
*  is saying to the Supreme Court, take this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=230.56s)]
*  No one agrees with the ruling that you people concocted, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=234.16s)]
*  declared that no president, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=238.56s)]
*  every president has immunity from nearly everything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=240.6s)]
*  Take this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=243.2s)]
*  And it's just a kernel of what Jack Smith [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=244.32s)]
*  has found, apparently. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=246.56s)]
*  I don't know whether it has an impact or not. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=249.2s)]
*  I don't think it's the October surprise. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the big October surprise is gonna happen [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=253.04s)]
*  out of the Middle East. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=255.2s)]
*  Yeah, let's revisit that in just a second. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  On this, there's also an unnamed Trump campaign staffer [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=259.64s)]
*  who even said, make them riot [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=262.84s)]
*  when there was some disturbances at a local campaign office. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=265.2s)]
*  How much, if you were counseling [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=268.76s)]
*  the Harris campaign right now, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=270.44s)]
*  how much would January 6th, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=272.36s)]
*  Defense of Democracy, be one of your closing arguments? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=273.76s)]
*  It worked for the Democrats in both 2020 and in 2022. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=276.64s)]
*  President Biden drove that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=279.68s)]
*  Do you think it still will this time around? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=281.28s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=283.28s)]
*  I do because I think every day [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=284.2s)]
*  he will give you something else. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=286.76s)]
*  Trump will give you something else. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=288.44s)]
*  He'll give you another gift [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  in terms of running against him. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=291.44s)]
*  Depends on how the vice president packages it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=293.2s)]
*  Okay, so let's go back to the Middle East. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=296.48s)]
*  We're sort of awaiting what Israel's response will be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=298.28s)]
*  to the Iranian attack of earlier this week. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  It is Rosh Hashanah, Jewish New Year, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  so the sense that maybe it'll wait till after that. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=304.88s)]
*  You sort of alluded to it, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=309.96s)]
*  that this could be something that changes [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  the calculation here domestically. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=312.72s)]
*  Do you think that's what Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=314.68s)]
*  has in mind? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=315.96s)]
*  Given his behavior towards this administration, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  and both outwardly and what you hear, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=322.32s)]
*  what you certainly hear in Washington from people, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=324.08s)]
*  what you pick up in terms of sources, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=326.68s)]
*  talking about the relationship between Netanyahu [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=328.68s)]
*  and the president, President Biden, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  yeah, I think Netanyahu has it in his mind [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=333.88s)]
*  that we're going to attack Iran. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=337.2s)]
*  We're gonna wipe out their oil refineries, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=338.8s)]
*  which will cause gas prices to jump up here [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=341.08s)]
*  in the next two or three weeks, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bTMacEGcLk&t=343.84s)]
