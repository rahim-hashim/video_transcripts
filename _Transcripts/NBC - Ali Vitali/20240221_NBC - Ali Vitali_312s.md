# Nikki Haley vows to stay in the 2024 race
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY)
*  Dropping out would be the easy route. I've never taken the easy route. I've been the underdog in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=0.0s)]
*  every race I've ever run. I've always been David taking on Goliath. And like David, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=6.32s)]
*  I'm not just fighting someone bigger than me. I'm fighting for something bigger than myself. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=14.0s)]
*  That was more from Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, who is vowing to stay [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=21.6s)]
*  in the race no matter the outcome of this weekend's GOP primary in South Carolina. That is coming up [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=25.68s)]
*  Saturday. Joining us now, congressional reporter for the New Republic, Grace Segers. Grace, you've [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=31.12s)]
*  been following these races very closely. Thank you for being here. So let's talk about Nikki Haley. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=36.4s)]
*  She's not going to win on Saturday. I think we can safely predict that. And though it is her home [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=42.56s)]
*  state, odds are she'll face a pretty decisive loss. Polls have narrowed slightly, but we're [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  talking narrowed from being down 40 points to maybe being down 20. But she seems pretty [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=51.12s)]
*  committed to staying in to Michigan, which is next week, and then Super Tuesday after that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=56.08s)]
*  Do we believe her? I think that she is committed to staying in. At this point, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=60.48s)]
*  it would be a very bad look if she backed out now that she has pledged that she would stay [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=65.28s)]
*  in until Super Tuesday and perhaps even beyond, even if she loses significantly, which she is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=71.2s)]
*  expected to do. It would be pretty embarrassing at this point to back down. I do wonder where this [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=78.0s)]
*  fiery version of Nikki Haley was a year ago when she could have been criticizing Trump this much [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=84.0s)]
*  then and perhaps been able to coalesce her support more from the anti-Trump faction. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=90.24s)]
*  And instead, it seems too well too late. Yeah, there was, I think, that window [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=94.88s)]
*  before his indictments where she could have gone on the attack and maybe had more of an impact. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=100.64s)]
*  She's staying in. What are her aides saying in terms of what the game plan here is? Is it simply [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=106.4s)]
*  a courageous stance? And if so, good for her. Or is it also the idea of, well, if I'm the only [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=114.72s)]
*  alternative and something were to happen to Trump, criminally or otherwise, well, then that's the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=119.36s)]
*  reason to hang around. I think it's very much the latter. Partially, sure, it may be a little bit of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=123.84s)]
*  a courageous stance, if you want to put it that way. But I also think that they are definitely [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=129.28s)]
*  hedging their bets. They're saying, look, Trump is old, Biden is old, Trump could possibly be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=134.4s)]
*  convicted of something we don't know and might as well stay in until the end. So I really think [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=140.32s)]
*  that that's their goal. And also looking potentially at the future as well. It's never too early to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=147.28s)]
*  look at 2028 and to see him as a viable alternative to whatever comes next. Grace, I'm officially [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=154.08s)]
*  saying it's too early to look to 2028. I can't, I'm already tired thinking about that. So, I mean, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=160.4s)]
*  the Trump team has obviously said, look, this race is over. They put out a state of the race memo [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=166.0s)]
*  yesterday to kind of counteract the Haley speech. And they're saying, look, we're going to win and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=169.36s)]
*  win big. They probably are. But chart for us this next week or so, is there a chance that Haley could [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=172.56s)]
*  fare better in Michigan? And how's the Super Tuesday calendar looking for her? Well, I think [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=177.76s)]
*  she could definitely fare better in Michigan where there may be more Haley-interested Republican [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=182.4s)]
*  voters as opposed to in South Carolina, which despite being her home state is very strongly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=189.92s)]
*  pro-Trump. Michigan, there may be some more moderate Republican voters there. Super Tuesday, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=195.6s)]
*  it's a whole host of states. She could do better in them. But Trump's campaign aides are saying [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=201.6s)]
*  that even if she won what she won in New Hampshire, 43 percent, in all of the states going forward, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  she would still not be able to catch up to Trump's lead. So even if she does that well, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=214.32s)]
*  she is probably not going to do well enough to beat him. And it's very hard to see if she can [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  get better than him. And let's also lastly, let's talk about the impact she could have in the general [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=226.0s)]
*  election. She were to let's say she loses, but she hangs around for a couple more months. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=229.76s)]
*  Something like yesterday where she built a major speech, got picked up by Fox News, which does not [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=233.2s)]
*  carry a lot of her events, but they carried yesterday. She's delivering these attacks to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump to Republican audiences who aren't going to hear them if Joe Biden says it, perhaps. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=241.68s)]
*  Is this a way where even just on the margins where Haley could make a dent and help Biden this fall? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=246.88s)]
*  Well, I think she was very clever to build this big speech. And then Fox News and others picked [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=251.6s)]
*  it up when they may not have because they thought she was going to drop out. Instead, she got to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=258.0s)]
*  give a campaign speech. I think she will have an impact, but I don't know if she will drop out and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=262.0s)]
*  immediately endorse Trump as some other candidates have done. That doesn't seem her style, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=268.4s)]
*  but she could definitely be a bit of a power player if she decides to hold on to her endorsement [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=274.23999999999995s)]
*  until the very last moment. It is maybe a little telling the last couple of days. She's backed off [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=278.96s)]
*  a little bit her previous pledge to support Trump. Now she's saying not necessarily. Good stuff this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=282.88s)]
*  morning from Congressional reporter for the New Republic, Grace Segers. Grace, thank you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  for joining us this morning. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=290.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpu1e7MpwVY&t=298.4s)]
