# U.S. stocks on track to end February lower
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk)
*  Welcome back. Time now for business and for that we're joined today by business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=0.0s)]
*  and policy reporter for the New York Times Lauren Hirsch who joins us here at [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Third Arc. Lauren, great to see you. So stocks rose in the US yesterday but [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=8.18s)]
*  they're still on track to end the month of February much much lower than [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=12.64s)]
*  they've been. So tell us some of those forces that drove them down and how [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=16.4s)]
*  today looks like it's beginning. So it's been a bit of a whiplash for 2023 so far. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=19.56s)]
*  January was the best January since 2019. Last week was the worst week of the year [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=23.6s)]
*  and that was really a reaction to some key inflation numbers we got in last [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=28.84s)]
*  Friday. There was some optimism at the end of 2022. Maybe inflation was cooling, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=33.32s)]
*  maybe interest rates wouldn't rise quite as quickly as some people were [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=38.4s)]
*  concerned about. Now it's a little bit back to the drawing board. People are [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=42.72s)]
*  thinking maybe the Fed will have to go more than 5%. So what you're seeing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  in the market is really investors having to grapple once again with the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=50.4s)]
*  prospect of continued rising rates. And all eyes will be on Jerome Powell yet [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=54.52s)]
*  again. So you wrote in Dealbook about China which is certainly a country in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  the news if you will. A lot swirling around it and particularly this COVID [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  lab leak theory. We know that Department of Energy has put out the idea that at [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=68.92s)]
*  least there's a possibility that this virus leaked from a lab there. There's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=72.76s)]
*  not definitive conclusions from other agencies about that but it's still [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=78.4s)]
*  going to have an economic impact you write on both US and Chinese companies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Tell us about it. As you mentioned the White House had made clear there's no [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=87.64s)]
*  consensus but yes it comes at a time where there is huge uncertainty in the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=91.4s)]
*  business community over what the relations are going to be between US and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=95.88s)]
*  China in the next year. And China is still an exceptionally important market [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=99.8s)]
*  for US businesses. McDonald's is building out about 900 new stores this year. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=104.44s)]
*  Starbucks is building up thousands the next several year. It's very important [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  to them and so as you see this rhetoric really ratchet up in DC and now they [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=113.96s)]
*  have you know Republicans certainly have more reasons to decry relations. You're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  going to see companies have to grapple with what to do and how to expand in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=125.84s)]
*  China while still really staying out of the out of the crosshairs. So there had [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=130.2s)]
*  already been a little bit of movement to pull out of China as when the pandemic [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  began and some of that just because just a lot of countries decided like hey we [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=137.76s)]
*  need to do more stuff this at home and not rely on foreign supply chains. Has [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=141.08s)]
*  that give us nothing on how that process has been going and whether or not you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=145.28s)]
*  think that'll accelerate here too. So it's an interesting dynamic absolutely [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=150.68s)]
*  supply chains has been a thing that US companies have been thinking about at [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=154.24s)]
*  least since the pandemic after Russia Ukraine that re-upped concerns because [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=158.0s)]
*  they began to think well if you had a pull out of Russia but we now have to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=163.2s)]
*  pull out of China. So you absolutely see companies rethinking supply chain but [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=166.44s)]
*  on the consumer front I mentioned Starbucks I mentioned McDonald's plenty [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=171.24s)]
*  of others. China's reopening now that's business that's growth companies like [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=175.12s)]
*  growth so the consumer facing brands they're still eyeing China so you're [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  really seeing companies grapple with these dual forces and we're going to see [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=184.28s)]
*  them all respond differently. And it seems like the last element of this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=187.96s)]
*  would be if the US determines that China is definitively helping Russia in its [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=191.68s)]
*  war if sanctions come that could change the equation even further. It is a it is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=196.0s)]
*  one of the top three concerns in the boardroom across America. Alright this [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=200.04s)]
*  is fascinating stuff and we're gonna be talking a lot more about it. Business and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=203.28s)]
*  Policy reporter from the New York Times Lauren Hirsch thank you for joining us [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=205.76s)]
*  this morning. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj0vyC4KKzk&t=208.36s)]
