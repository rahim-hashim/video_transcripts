# Trump claims Putin will release jailed American journalist after he's re-elected
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=0.0s)]
*  This search for a presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump's running mate, appears to be [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=2.54s)]
*  ramping up. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=6.44s)]
*  Sources close to the campaign telling NBC News that the list has been narrowed down [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=7.68s)]
*  to four contenders. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=12.74s)]
*  Ohio Senator JD Vance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=14.52s)]
*  and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=21.68s)]
*  All those candidates recently received vetting materials from the Trump campaign. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=24.96s)]
*  Something that is expected to be made before the Republican National Convention, which [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=29.46s)]
*  kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15th. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=32.74s)]
*  In another Trump-related development, in a newly released campaign video, the former [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=36.34s)]
*  president is doubling down on his claim that if he's re-elected, Russian President Vladimir [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  Putin will release imprisoned American journalist, Evan Gershkovitz. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=45.82s)]
*  Evan Gershkovitz, the reporter for the Wall Street Journal who is being held by Russia, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=52.06s)]
*  will be released almost immediately after the election, but definitely before I assume [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=58.26s)]
*  office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  He will be home, he will be safe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=64.5s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, will do that for me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=66.62s)]
*  And I don't believe he'll do it for anyone else. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=70.17999999999999s)]
*  And we will be paying nothing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=72.96s)]
*  Biden likes to pay massive numbers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=75.02s)]
*  We will be paying nothing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=78.02s)]
*  The 32-year-old Gershkovitz has been jailed on espionage charges in Russia since 2023. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=80.58s)]
*  That accusation has been thoroughly denied by the U.S. government. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=85.94s)]
*  Joining us now, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and associate editor of the Washington Post, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=90.42s)]
*  as well as an MSNBC political analyst, Eugene Robinson. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=94.78s)]
*  Eugene, let's start there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=98.02s)]
*  Just how dangerous and blatant is this message Donald Trump sending to Vladimir Putin? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=99.58s)]
*  Well, it's obscene. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=105.66s)]
*  It's absolutely obscene and disgusting that he would use this as some sort of a campaign [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=107.5s)]
*  ploy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=115.46s)]
*  You know, the obvious question is, OK, if you could get Vladimir Putin to release Evan, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=116.46s)]
*  do it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=125.46s)]
*  Do it now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=126.46s)]
*  The idea that, oh, yeah, well, if you just vote for me, I will get him home. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  It's just obscene. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=134.5s)]
*  That's the only word for it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=135.5s)]
*  And either, you know, it does raise the question of what sort of communication he might or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=138.5s)]
*  might not be having with Vladimir Putin, but he's probably making it all up, sending a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=144.62s)]
*  signal to Putin not to release Evan until after the election. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=150.22s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=156.22s)]
*  And just reprehensible is another word that pops to mind. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=159.22s)]
*  That's a good word. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=163.22s)]
*  That's a good word. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=164.22s)]
*  Eugene, let's talk about sort of the Washington story of the moment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=165.22s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal had a report yesterday suggesting that behind closed doors in some [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=168.94s)]
*  important meetings, President Joe Biden showing signs of age, some signs of slippage, as they [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=173.42s)]
*  put it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=178.7s)]
*  The White House fiercely pushed back, saying that they're pointing to the Republicans quoted, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=179.7s)]
*  saying there are lots of Democrats out there who say President Biden, sure, he's 81, but [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=184.9s)]
*  he's just fine to do the job. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=188.5s)]
*  Give us your analysis of this tempest here as it revives a storyline the White House [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=190.74s)]
*  hoped it was behind them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=195.06s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  It brings it back to the fore. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=197.96s)]
*  And look, you know, I try. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  I'm not a media critic. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=201.94s)]
*  I try not to do that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  I don't like a lot of navel gazing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  But in this case, I will point out that while the story says the reporters did speak with [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=207.02s)]
*  Democrats, who somehow shared this idea of Biden slipping, in fact, it does not quote [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  any Democrats by name as saying that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=222.94s)]
*  It fails to quote a number of Democrats who were spoken to by the reporters who said the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=226.46s)]
*  opposite. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=233.9s)]
*  So I'm not going to, you know, Wall Street Journal is a great newspaper and it has high [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=234.9s)]
*  standards. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=241.38s)]
*  But I think, you know, a story quoting a whole bunch of Republicans saying Joe Biden has [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=243.06s)]
*  lost more than a step is not it's not worthy of generating a tempest over. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=249.58s)]
*  It's not news. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=257.02000000000004s)]
*  That's a that's a line, a campaign line. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=258.02000000000004s)]
*  That's a line of attack that the Republican Party has used all along. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  And so if there's a revelation there to be made, I don't think they have made it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=265.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, polls suggest, look, that some voters do care about President Biden's age, but also [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump, only a couple of years younger. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=276.14s)]
*  He's got a birthday next week and we have played time and time again here in the mornings, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=278.1s)]
*  the shines of complete, complete, complete incoherence at times by Trump. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=282.98s)]
*  And so we could certainly do that sort of story just with publicly available clips of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=289.22s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=293.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=294.82s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=295.82s)]
*  And Jean, let's close with your thoughts here on the D-Day anniversary, the sacrifices of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=296.82s)]
*  80 years ago, but also how current and important it is now in a Europe that is once again shadow [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  by war and President Biden going to stress the need for alliances. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=308.02s)]
*  Yeah, this seems like a really, really important anniversary, number one, because of what's [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=311.38s)]
*  going on in Europe. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  This land war, the biggest land war since World War Two, Putin's attempt to conquer [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=319.62s)]
*  Ukraine, to swallow Ukraine and the threat that Europeans feel in other countries of, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=327.26s)]
*  you know, from Russia. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  And it's, that's one moment. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=337.46s)]
*  And the other thing is what's happening in the United States, this pivotal election we [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=342.14s)]
*  have coming up, the divisions in our country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=346.58s)]
*  And you know, what I've been thinking about the last couple of days and I guess may write [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=350.58s)]
*  about today is that, you know, the country had divisions before. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=354.86s)]
*  The country was divided before World War Two in a whole lot of ways. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=359.82s)]
*  And in some of those ways, much worse than it's divided now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  And we did manage to come together for this incredible achievement of winning the biggest [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=370.18s)]
*  war that there ever was. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=378.34000000000003s)]
*  And so maybe we should just keep everything in perspective. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=381.62s)]
*  Let's hope you are right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=387.18s)]
*  We're looking at live footage there from Normandy and we will hear from the president a little [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=388.54s)]
*  later this morning. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=392.42s)]
*  And we'll hear from the Washington Post's Eugene Robinson. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=394.1s)]
*  Thank you, my friend, and thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=395.62s)]
*  this Thursday morning. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=399.54s)]
*  Morning Joe starts right now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFVPwqPOvQY&t=400.54s)]
