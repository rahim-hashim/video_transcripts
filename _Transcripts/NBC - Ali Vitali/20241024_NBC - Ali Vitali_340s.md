# Vance says Trump is 'healthier than I am'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc)
*  I try to be a humble guy. I think the presidency is of course such a big job. I feel extremely [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=0.0s)]
*  confident. I mean, Donald Trump is healthier than I am. So I feel extremely confident that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to serve and serve well for four years for the American people and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=12.32s)]
*  I'm going to help them and we're going to make America great again and we're going to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=16.8s)]
*  do it together. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=19.88s)]
*  That was Republican Senator JD Vance speaking at a rally in Reno, Nevada yesterday. Joining [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=23.28s)]
*  us now, contributor to the conservative website, the Bullwork, Tim Miller. He previously served [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=28.4s)]
*  as communications director for Jeb Bush and spokesman for the Republican National Committee. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=33.44s)]
*  He's one of our favorites around here. Tim, JD Vance is almost 40 years younger than Donald [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Trump, but that won't stop him from saying that Donald Trump is healthier, smarter, more [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=44.959999999999994s)]
*  handsome than he is. There really isn't anything they won't say to flatter the boss, will they? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the North Korea type spin remains uncomfortable, even though we've been dealing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=55.36s)]
*  with it for whatever, nine years now, Jonathan. And I think JD Vance in particular feels like [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=60.92s)]
*  he has to go overboard to overcompensate for the fact that he sounded a lot like me. You [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=67.0s)]
*  know, he was a never Trump Republican for many years before he decided to go all in. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=72.76s)]
*  And I think this is kind of a way for him to maintain credibility with the boss and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=78.56s)]
*  that has an audience of one, if you will. Yeah, no doubt there. So let's talk about [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=81.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris. What appears to be part of her closing argument is these John Kelly revelations [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  and it fits into her declaration that Donald Trump is unfit for office, you know, in terms [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=93.56s)]
*  of how he praised Hitler and the like. Do you think that's an effective argument here? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=98.48s)]
*  And who would it work with? Yeah, I don't know that the Hitler part itself is that effective [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  argument. Right. And any any person who thinks that Donald Trump might be Hitler curious is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=111.12s)]
*  already voting against him. Or maybe there's another category of people that like that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=117.4s)]
*  But those people aren't really gettable either. And so I think that there is an element of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  this that's really important. And all the testing shows this. Right. Which is if you think [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=125.4s)]
*  about the types of voters that are available, it's mostly kind of my people like Mitt Romney [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=129.04s)]
*  voting older Republicans that are trying to decide if they can get their own comma that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=133.56s)]
*  don't like Trump, the Nikki Haley voter, if you will, or younger people who haven't really paid [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=138.52s)]
*  that close of attention to what's happening and might not know who John Kelly is still. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=143.12s)]
*  Those are the two of the kind of final groups that haven't decided where they're landing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=147.52s)]
*  And I think communicating to them that the closest people around Donald Trump, that maybe [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=151.8s)]
*  if you're wavering, listen to Mike Pence, listen to John Kelly, listen to Jim Mattis, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=156.12s)]
*  his closest advisors can't get there. They think that he's dangerous. They think he's not worth [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=161.32000000000002s)]
*  the risk. I think that more nuanced message is quite compelling and it tests well if you [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=166.2s)]
*  look at Democratic internal polling as well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=172.88s)]
*  So voters that might still be available, you just mentioned a few. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  There's also this we've had a few cycles in a row now where there's been sort of a hidden vote. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, 16 and 20. You know, the Trump supporters were undercounted by pollsters. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=181.72s)]
*  They showed up bigger on Election Day enough to give them a win in 16 and a much closer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=186.12s)]
*  loss than expected in 20. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  What group do you think could be that hidden vote this time around? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  Are there still more Trump voters that pollsters aren't picking up or is it someone else, perhaps [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=195.76s)]
*  women who were upset by the job decision who might be breaking late and quietly for Harris? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll stay with the positive first since you ended there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  I do think that non-college white women post-dobbs, we haven't seen a lot of this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  You saw a little bit of this in like in the midterms in places like Kansas where an abortion [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=214.84s)]
*  referendum did well in a very conservative state. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=220.96s)]
*  I think that there are some non-college white women out there that live in very Trumpy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=223.52s)]
*  communities whose husbands are for Trump, whose neighbors have huge Trump signs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=227.72s)]
*  They're not really talking about the fact that they plan to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=232.88s)]
*  I think that's out there. How big is it impacting polling? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=235.96s)]
*  Who's to say? I think the worry if you're Harris is that this other group, kind of younger [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=239.4s)]
*  black and Latino men, maybe aren't being responsive to polls. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=244.8s)]
*  And you're seeing some evidence that there's some slippage there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  And so I think we'll know. I was in Amy Walter, The Cook Report. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=251.2s)]
*  You'll know a lot early on Election Day, you know, based on those upper Midwest states, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=254.44s)]
*  if she's ever performing there, it might have been those non-college white women or older [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=259.36s)]
*  Republican voters. If Trump's doing better in kind of the let's say the Mountain West [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=263.32s)]
*  states, it might have been those younger Hispanic men. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=267.88s)]
*  So, Tim, as a final question, give us your take on the map right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=270.36s)]
*  What is Harris's best path? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  Is it still the three blue wall states? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=275.4s)]
*  Or do you think it's a mix and match with some Sunbelt? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=277.4s)]
*  I think it's the three blue wall states. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  And then if you lose one, you're looking at either North Carolina could replace Wisconsin [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=282.0s)]
*  and Michigan or North Carolina plus Nevada could replace Pennsylvania. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think those five states are pretty much the ones that matter the most. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=291.08s)]
*  Georgia and Arizona, I don't think are out of reach for her. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  But I think those are less important as far as reaching 270. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  And I think Donald Trump's in the best position in those two of the seven states. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, certainly those in the Harris campaign of the seven battleground states probably [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=305.56s)]
*  feel the worst about Arizona, but growing more confident about Nevada. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=308.64s)]
*  So that could fit into that puzzle piece you just described. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=312.08s)]
*  Contribute to the conservative website, the Boulevard, Tim Miller. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  Tim, thank you as always. We'll talk to you again real soon. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_C4UiUYJc&t=317.79999999999995s)]
