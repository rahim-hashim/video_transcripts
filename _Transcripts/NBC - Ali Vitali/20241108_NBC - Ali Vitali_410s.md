# Biden addresses the nation after Democrats' election losses
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY)
*  Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=0.0s)]
*  We all get knocked down. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  But the measure of our character, as my dad would say, is how quickly we get back up. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=8.52s)]
*  Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=12.88s)]
*  We lost this battle. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=18.72s)]
*  We're going to be OK. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=19.72s)]
*  But we need to stay engaged. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=21.48s)]
*  We need to keep going. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=25.28s)]
*  And above all, we need to keep the faith. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=27.72s)]
*  That was more from President Biden's speech from the Rose Garden yesterday following Donald [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=32.24s)]
*  Trump's win this week. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=36.28s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, our friend Ken Thomas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=38.12s)]
*  Ken, striking to me, President Biden addressed the nation from the Rose Garden just as then-President [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=43.0s)]
*  Obama did eight years ago when Trump won the first time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about his remarks yesterday. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=52.72s)]
*  He has, of course, conveyed Trump as an existential threat to our nation's democracy, but yet [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=55.4s)]
*  yesterday pledged to adhere to the tenets of America's founding and a peaceful transfer [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=60.28s)]
*  of power. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=65.52s)]
*  Yeah, it was eight years to the day, nearly to the day when Obama and Biden were there [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=66.52s)]
*  in the Rose Garden. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=72.28s)]
*  You know, I think he tried to say that there's a peaceful transfer of power that will come. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=73.28s)]
*  He praised Kamala Harris's campaign and tried to keep his team engaged and talk about some [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=79.72s)]
*  of the accomplishments that they made. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=85.64s)]
*  But, you know, I think behind the scenes, there's a lot of frustration with Biden right [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=87.28s)]
*  now that he ran for a second term and took so long after that debate to get out of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=90.84s)]
*  race. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, we certainly saw some of that in a tweet from David Plouffe, a Harris adviser. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  He said that, you know, we dug into it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  We were dug into a deep hole and we're able to get out, but it wasn't enough. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  That tweet was then deleted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=112.12s)]
*  But I think it really speaks to the frustration we're hearing within this party. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=114.04s)]
*  You know, we're going to see Biden meet with Trump next week and there will certainly be, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=119.04s)]
*  you know, the two teams will be working together. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=123.76s)]
*  It sounds like on the transition. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  But there's just an enormous amount of consternation right now within the party about what just [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=128.36s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=133.28s)]
*  We should note Plouffe deleted his entire Twitter ex account. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=134.8s)]
*  So let's dive into more that there's a lot of behind the scenes finger pointing and starting [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=137.0s)]
*  to break out in the open here among Democrats second guessing the vice president's messaging, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  you know, second guessing the president's decisions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=147.52s)]
*  It does seem like Biden himself catching a lot of the blame. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=149.64s)]
*  You know, it is some of his aides have said to me that a difference of a couple of weeks [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=152.84s)]
*  if he had bad out a couple of weeks earlier in the summer, that really wouldn't have mattered. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=156.64s)]
*  The real issue would have been had he stepped aside, let's say after the 2022 midterms, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=160.96s)]
*  when his record sparkling and Democrats had done well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=165.4s)]
*  But there was already polls reflected a sense that Americans simply thought he was too old, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  that they they liked his job during those first two years, but they weren't sure they [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=172.84s)]
*  wanted to have another six. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=176.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of frustration with his advisors for, you know, encouraging [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=177.88s)]
*  him to run. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=185.02s)]
*  And as you remember, after that 2022 midterms, there really wasn't a serious debate internally [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  about whether he shouldn't run or not. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=192.16s)]
*  I mean, there was just this this idea that he performed well, the party performed well [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  in the midterms, and that means he should automatically run for reelection. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  That's what our reporting showed in this piece, just that, you know, no one was going to tell [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=203.48s)]
*  somebody who had been running for president for 50 years and finally got the job that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=208.16s)]
*  he should not run for a second term. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  And so a lot of Democrats feel like, you know, that put them in in real deep trouble [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  from the get go. There wasn't this opportunity to have an open primary process. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=222.0s)]
*  You know, the party has a very strong bench. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=226.88s)]
*  You know, there could have been, you know, a real debate, maybe, you know, you know, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=229.48s)]
*  get behind somebody as opposed to this 100 day campaign with Harris. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=234.04s)]
*  And by all accounts, she performed very well. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of people in the party said feel that she did everything she could. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=241.64s)]
*  But in the in the end, they were dealing with this, you know, wrong track of about 70 percent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  That's something most incumbent party candidates can't overcome. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=251.16s)]
*  And just Joe Biden at at 40 percent approval. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=255.44s)]
*  That's just it's very difficult for anybody to overcome those types of forces within our [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=258.68s)]
*  politics. Yeah, there's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking happening on. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  But you're right to point out that back in 2022, there wasn't much of a debate about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=266.52s)]
*  Biden running again, despite the polls that Americans said, maybe he's too old. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=270.08s)]
*  He also delivered a stellar state of the union in early 2023. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=273.24s)]
*  But it does seem the Democrats, their problems are bigger than just Biden or Harris. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=276.64s)]
*  And you've got some new reporting about the serious soul searching that needs to come [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  for this party in the week's months and even years to come, because this was this was a [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=285.08s)]
*  wipeout. And Donald Trump and the Republicans gained a greater percentage of votes [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=288.96s)]
*  in 48 of the 50 states and over 90 percent of the nation's counties. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=294.6s)]
*  Yeah. And look, this is the first time in 20 years that Democrats are going to lose [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=300.24s)]
*  the popular vote. And they lost among a number of demographics who were normally with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  them. You know, Hispanic men is, you know, Congressman Curbelo just just spoke about, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=311.48s)]
*  you know, black men. You know, we're going to know more as the data comes in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=315.92s)]
*  But, you know, this is I think a fundamental reckoning within the party. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=319.8s)]
*  You're going to see in the days ahead. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=323.48s)]
*  I mean, Bernie Sanders had a scathing statement out the other day just on the party's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=325.44s)]
*  inability to connect with working class voters. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=332.2s)]
*  I think you're going to see him this weekend. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  The other place you're going to see this happen is in the DNC chairman's race. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=337.0s)]
*  You know, I think you'll have an open process to pick the next chair of the DNC. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  And and I think that this whole debate will will be part of that election process. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And Ken, lastly, like our last 20 seconds here, that DNC race, there really [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  isn't a real party leader right now. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  Like who takes the mantle? Schumer, Jeffries? Who is it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think you could see Jeffries as potentially the leader of the party, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=361.24s)]
*  just given, you know, where the House is much more narrow. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=366.20000000000005s)]
*  But, you know, there's there's no one really who is expected to emerge. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=369.72s)]
*  I think they're going to have to look to a lot of governors around the country for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=373.48s)]
*  leadership for the next generation. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=376.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was the role Nancy Pelosi played the first time when Trump won. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=377.96s)]
*  But right now, an open question, really terrific reporting for us this morning [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=380.96s)]
*  from White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=384.52s)]
*  Ken, thank you for joining us at the end of a long week. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=387.23999999999995s)]
*  Come back soon. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0vtKiUZGY&t=389.11999999999995s)]
