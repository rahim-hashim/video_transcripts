# Trump hails 'wonderful' Hannibal Lecter at New Jersey rally
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM)
*  And speaking of the former president, he returned to the campaign trail over the weekend, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=0.0s)]
*  while doing so, offered some praise for one of the most notorious fictional characters [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=4.96s)]
*  of all time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  At a rally in Wildwood, New Jersey on Saturday, Trump likened migrants entering the country [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=12.56s)]
*  to Hannibal Lecter, the fictional character from the Silence of the Lambs book and movie. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=18.6s)]
*  It's a comparison he's been making over the past year, but unlike previous occasions, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=24.64s)]
*  Trump lauded the serial killer, a cannibal mind you, while talking to that crowd in New Jersey. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  I'm about to have a friend for dinner, but Hannibal Lecter. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=54.64s)]
*  Congratulations, the late great Hannibal Lecter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=58.84s)]
*  Trump drew a big crowd there in New Jersey, but still a safely blue state. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=63.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Biden spent part of his weekend on the West Coast, raising millions [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=68.32s)]
*  for his re-election mid. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=72.92s)]
*  At a private fundraiser in Washington state on Saturday, just outside Seattle, Biden ramped [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=74.78s)]
*  up his attacks on Trump, telling donors this. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=80.12s)]
*  It's clear that when he lost in 2020, something snapped in him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=83.84s)]
*  He's not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he's clearly unhinged. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  Just listen to what he's telling people. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=93.44s)]
*  The president was also in the Bay Area raising money over the weekend, and the Biden campaign [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  announced he'll be returning to the West Coast next month for a star-studded fundraiser in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=100.92s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=105.56s)]
*  The campaign is looking to boost fundraising efforts at a time when Trump, in the RNC attempt [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=106.56s)]
*  to close the contributions gap. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  A-list guests expected to attend the event include former President Barack Obama and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=114.92s)]
*  then the actors George Clooney and Julia Roberts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=119.88s)]
*  The two Academy Award winners will also be featured in a campaign social media contest [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=122.84s)]
*  and have their names on contribution emails. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=127.56s)]
*  President Biden is also expected to hold a fundraiser with Bill and Hillary Clinton early [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=131.08s)]
*  this summer. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  That's according to a source familiar with their plans, telling NBC News. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=136.32s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for the Associated Press, Darlene Superville. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=141.56s)]
*  Darlene, good morning. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=146.08s)]
*  Thanks for starting us off this morning. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=147.08s)]
*  So, former President Trump, of course, has been largely confined to a Manhattan courtroom [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  in recent weeks, but he did get out on the campaign trail this weekend. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=154.96s)]
*  Sort of an unusual choice to do so in New Jersey, but it provided us an unusual, rare [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=158.76s)]
*  split screen where we had Trump and President Biden both on the campaign trail at the same [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=163.84s)]
*  time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=169.36s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about what we heard from each man. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=170.36s)]
*  Good morning, Jonathan. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=174.08s)]
*  As you mentioned, President Biden spent part of the weekend on the West Coast. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  He was in the San Francisco area, also Seattle. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=179.68s)]
*  He had four fundraisers between those cities, raising millions of dollars. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  Largely the president's fundraising speeches are a split between trying to draw a contrast [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  with the former President Donald Trump, talking about him, as you mentioned earlier, as being [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=194.24s)]
*  unhinged, you know, something snapped in him in 2020. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  He makes some jokes. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=203.98s)]
*  What we saw from President Trump, former President Trump, over the weekend in New Jersey was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=206.54s)]
*  what the local authorities said. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=210.94s)]
*  There was a huge crowd of 80,000 to 100,000 people who showed up for him in this reliably [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=212.84s)]
*  blue state for this rally. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=219.9s)]
*  The former president isn't getting out on the campaign trail as much as we all know [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=222.72s)]
*  because he's spending a lot of his time in a New York courtroom. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=227.92s)]
*  But his appearance over the weekend was basically an hour and a half of criticizing President [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=231.48s)]
*  Biden largely over his handling of the economy, electric vehicles, China, and his praise of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=239.12s)]
*  Hannibal Lecter, as you just mentioned. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, hard to imagine the serial killer vote will come out strong in this election, but [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=250.72s)]
*  one never knows. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  And certainly some other officials disputed the size of that crowd, but certainly a big [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=256.64s)]
*  one all the same. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=261.28s)]
*  So Darlene, the Biden campaign and the president himself have largely avoided talking about [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=262.96s)]
*  Trump's legal issues. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=268.96s)]
*  They don't want to be perceived as having their thumb on the scale in any way, although [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=271.08s)]
*  the president occasionally will make a joke, but he doesn't talk about it directly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  But behind the scenes, how is the campaign trying to use this moment to their advantage? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  While Trump is confined to a courtroom, while the salacious details of this matter are on [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=282.92s)]
*  display for the public to see, how is the Biden campaign trying to further that split-screen [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=288.36s)]
*  image? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=293.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=294.88s)]
*  One of the things that you're seeing from President Biden is just the pace of his campaigning. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  With former President Trump stuck in a courtroom, the playing field or the campaign field is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  largely Biden's to take advantage of. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  And you're seeing the president trying to do that with the trip over the weekend to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=316.3s)]
*  the West Coast. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=320.85999999999996s)]
*  He has some more campaigning coming up this weekend. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  Basically, every week we'll see this split-screen with the former president in a courtroom and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=324.7s)]
*  President Biden out somewhere in the country talking about what he's doing and how awful [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=332.34s)]
*  he thinks it would be if the former president is reelected, that sort of thing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=338.94s)]
*  So that's one of the ways they're trying to take advantage of it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=343.14s)]
*  And of course, the other way they're trying to take advantage of it is also through the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=345.94s)]
*  fundraising. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=349.3s)]
*  Right now, President Biden does have a bit of a cash advantage over the former president, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=350.86s)]
*  and that's something they would like to maintain and build upon. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  And so we're also seeing that as another way that they're trying to capitalize on the situation. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=359.98s)]
*  And as you note in your reporting, trying to remind Americans just what the Trump term [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=365.9s)]
*  was like. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=370.34s)]
*  It seems like so many voters have forgotten at least parts of it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=371.34s)]
*  Thank you so much for starting us off this morning. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=375.58s)]
*  White House reporter for the AP, Darlene Superville. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=377.34s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CwU-qOyYfM&t=380.1s)]
