# GOP leaders to meet with Trump officials as budget battle heats up
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ)
*  The House and the Senate have passed competing budget frameworks, and now it's time to figure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=0.0s)]
*  out which one they're actually going to go with. This should be interesting. Republican leadership, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=4.32s)]
*  including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, both met with President [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=8.56s)]
*  Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Besson yesterday to discuss the plans. It comes as multiple Senate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=12.88s)]
*  Republicans have already drawn a red line saying they want to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=17.84s)]
*  rather than just extending them, as the House bill instructs. Trump, for his part, agrees with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=23.44s)]
*  those Senate Republicans, despite already endorsing the House's plan. Following the meeting, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=27.92s)]
*  Johnson told reporters they'd decided to make some quote, very big decisions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=32.96s)]
*  Oh, it's a great meeting. We decided to make some big decisions. I'm going to let the president [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=38.0s)]
*  announce all that later, but very productive. Everybody is energized and excited about where [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=42.72s)]
*  we are. We know we have a lot of work ahead of us, but we're very optimistic we're going to get [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=49.28s)]
*  this vision accomplished. Is the Senate going to take up the House budget resolution or make an [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=52.64s)]
*  amendment or something? They're going to decide the contours of all that, but it's going to move [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  quickly, aggressively. So stay tuned. Joining us now, Washington correspondent for Spectrum News, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  Kevin Frey. Kevin, this is going to be a lot of difficulty for both the speaker and the majority [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=68.88s)]
*  leader who at this point haven't really worked together before either. So let's just first take [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=75.28s)]
*  their relationship. How is that shaping up? How are they working together? Right. I mean, so like [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  we talked about, you know, Johnson getting elected being the easy part. Well, now we've reached the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=84.08s)]
*  next easy part, which was getting just the resolution passed because it was so vague that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=88.08s)]
*  everyone could get on board. When it comes to their relationship, it's blossoming in real time [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=91.52s)]
*  because these two haven't worked with each other. And quite frankly, they're both pretty new, fresh [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=95.6s)]
*  faces, John Thune in particular. And so they are having to learn how to navigate the dynamics of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=100.08s)]
*  Capitol Hill and they're incredibly tight margins that they're both operating with, particularly [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=105.44s)]
*  Johnson in real time. And so there's a lot of tests that lie before them. So when you start applying [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=109.84s)]
*  that to legislation, Thune has been beneath McConnell studying kind of at the foot of a man who [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=114.64s)]
*  very much knew how to control the Republican Senate. But that Senate has changed a lot. And you've got [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  a lot of people who are very Trump aligned. So when you see them starting to lay red lines like this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=125.92s)]
*  one on taxes, for instance, when I read the House budget bill, I thought, okay, this is going to be [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=130.8s)]
*  a tax extension for maybe seven, eight, ten, probably not ten years because they're needing [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=135.6s)]
*  to keep costs down to placate their rightmost flank. But when you see that red line, do they [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=140.56s)]
*  have problems before they've even really begun? Right. Because I mean, they're both operating on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=145.12s)]
*  basically different principles. I mean, the bills are just dynamically rather different and we [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=148.0s)]
*  should stress its frameworks, not actual legislation. But within all of that, you have one camp wanting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  to extend taxes almost indefinitely. You have one that's looking to it, as you've mentioned, a shorter [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=157.04s)]
*  time frame to keep prices in. You have one camp because of the populist urge within the Republican [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=161.36s)]
*  Party that has blossomed under the Trump era that is concerned, particularly on the Senate side, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=166.8s)]
*  about any deep cuts to Medicaid and so forth. I'm thinking of Senator Hawley, whereas Republicans on [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  the House side, while they will deny that they are going to hurt Medicaid recipients, the math just [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=176.96s)]
*  does not, to coin a phrase, math. And so they're going to have to either add different restrictions [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  to Medicaid or they're going to have to deeply dive into it unless they take back on their claim [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=190.4s)]
*  that they're not going to touch Medicare, which Trump doesn't like. Yeah. Trump has laid his own [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=194.88s)]
*  red lines on this. And he's also said, I like the House bill because it's one bill, but then he also [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  likes parts of the Senate bill. So I think there's a lot of confusion in there. This goes back to the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=203.52s)]
*  dynamic that with Trump, because he never really gets into the legislative weeds or says one thing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=208.0s)]
*  or the other, it leaves leadership scrambling constantly. And there is always this outstanding [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=213.12s)]
*  fear of a repeat of what happened in December, which is obviously a different sort of bill and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=218.08s)]
*  set of requirements, but that he or Musk sends a tweet out in the middle of the night or a post [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=221.84s)]
*  or whatever you call it at this point. And everything gets upended. And that's exactly what we saw as [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=226.4s)]
*  they were trying to fund the government in December. Let us keep in mind also that as we talk about the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=232.56s)]
*  budget, that's a very separate process from funding the government, which they do have to do by March [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=236.4s)]
*  14th. We'll have you back to talk about that as it gets closer because Congress only operates on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=241.36s)]
*  deadlines. But having you here means we do have to talk about New York politics. And it is this [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=245.2s)]
*  really interesting confluence of a ton happening New York politics on the ground in New York. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  And then also you've got the two highest ranking Democratic leaders are New Yorkers. You talked to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=254.64s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries. What did he say? What didn't he say? What are you reading between the lines? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=259.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, so there's like chaos on multiple fronts. You've got a president who is a, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=263.12s)]
*  whose New York is his hometown and he is throwing his weight around in a way that he did not [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=267.84s)]
*  eight years ago, arguably to the same degree. Yes, he messed around with tax extensions or tax limits. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=271.84s)]
*  Yes, he messed around with the tunnel under the Hudson River that obviously keeps Amtrak at a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  bottleneck, but at the same time, not really touching it. He moved to Florida, for goodness sake. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  At the same time, he's now exactly, he's throwing his weight around in congestion pricing and other [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  things. On top of that, and any sort of grievances that he's driving when it comes to kind of messing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=296.4s)]
*  around in New York and wanting to be the king of New York, to quote the meme, you also have, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=302.24s)]
*  as you mentioned, Senator, Senator, oh, he wouldn't want me to say that Senator Chuck Schumer, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=306.24s)]
*  Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, top two Democrats in the House and Senate respectively. And they are [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=310.64s)]
*  now having to navigate how to be in the minority, whether or not they're being aggressive enough. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=315.52s)]
*  And oh yes, throw in the dynamics of upcoming governor's race that is on pins and needles [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=319.84s)]
*  because of Governor Hockel's ratings. And then also this new mayor's race that is emerging in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=325.04s)]
*  in a peak of chaos because of Mayor Eric Adams getting knocked around by the DOJ effectively. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  And then this idea of Andrew Cuomo. So when I asked Congressman Jeffries about the idea [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=336.0s)]
*  of Andrew Cuomo getting involved in the mayor's race, which is a very distinct possibility within [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  the next week or so, he basically did not comment, which is Jeffries way of kind of avoiding the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  topic, but at the same time saying a lot by not saying no, shall we say. He basically said, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=352.16s)]
*  my voters in my district in Brooklyn, which keep in mind, predominantly black voters, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  they have liked Cuomo historically, they might be interested in him. So he's definitely keeping his [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=363.20000000000005s)]
*  options open, especially as Cuomo's polling is pretty well. And he's so good at that because I [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=368.48s)]
*  remember you and I were talking during the break, he still hasn't called for Adams to resign either. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=372.64000000000004s)]
*  Correct. And he's very key. I mean, he chooses his words far better than I do, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=376.48s)]
*  very distinctly. And so he will use phrases like, for example, with with Eric Adams early on, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  he kept saying that it's going to be up to the voters to decide. But then he would add an [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=387.68s)]
*  addendum being like, perhaps decisively. And it's like, so, Congressman Jeffries, you are showing [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=392.24s)]
*  your hand as to where you think this is heading. But he won't outright say he should go away. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=397.68s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I do remember the definitive statement he gave to me back in the fall [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=402.24s)]
*  before the election. He said, I don't think he should resign. So at least he laid the marker [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=406.08s)]
*  there. But still a lot of questions that come from answers like that. Kevin Fry covering it all from [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=409.52s)]
*  New York to D.C. and everywhere in between. My friend. Thank you as always. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAl83Eri0DQ&t=414.96s)]
