# Judge Agrees To Postpone Trial For Proud Boys
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY)
*  The January 6th committee has reissued a subpoena to a Republican congressman who lost a bid for the Senate last week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=0.0s)]
*  after Trump rescinded his endorsement. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=6.0s)]
*  House lawmakers are looking to talk to Alabama's Mo Brooks, who spoke, of course, at that Stop the Steal rally from the ellipse [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=9.0s)]
*  just hours before the insurrection, and he did so while wearing bulletproof armor. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=16.0s)]
*  Brooks, a longtime Trump loyalist, had the support of the former president until late last year, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=21.0s)]
*  and he made the mistake of saying it was time to move on from the 2020 election. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=27.0s)]
*  Following those comments, Trump turned on the congressman, pulling his endorsement and backing his primary opponent instead. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=31.0s)]
*  After refusing to cooperate with the January 6th committee previously, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=38.0s)]
*  Brooks now reportedly says he is not only willing to speak to the panel, but would prefer to testify publicly. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=42.0s)]
*  He was beaten in a GOP Senate primary earlier this week. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=49.0s)]
*  A federal judge has pushed back the trial for several members of the Proud Boys who were charged with attacking the U.S. Capitol [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=53.0s)]
*  amid concerns that revelations from the January 6th committee's televised hearings could taint the jury pool. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=59.0s)]
*  Defense attorneys for several of the men argued that their clients wouldn't be guaranteed a fair trial by an impartial jury [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=66.0s)]
*  so soon after these public hearings. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=74.0s)]
*  They also voiced fears that they would not have enough time to review potential new evidence [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=77.0s)]
*  that could be released by the congressional panel in the coming weeks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=82.0s)]
*  The trial, originally scheduled for August 8th, will be delayed until mid-December. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=86.0s)]
*  Joining us now, congressional reporter for The Guardian, Hugo Lowell, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=92.0s)]
*  who thankfully has been a fixture here on Wait Too Early throughout the January 6th hearings. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=96.0s)]
*  Hugo, great to see you again. Let's start there with the Proud Boys. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=100.0s)]
*  How significant is it in your estimation that federal prosecutors are postponing the trial [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=104.0s)]
*  and what other impact might that decision have on other trials connected to the Capitol riot? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=109.0s)]
*  I think it is significant, right? It pushes everything back now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=116.0s)]
*  The timeline's going into 2023. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=120.0s)]
*  I mean, Judge Kelly said yesterday that the trial for the Proud Boys and the seditious conspiracy case [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=122.0s)]
*  is now not going to happen until December at the very earliest, as you said. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=129.0s)]
*  So this is going to push all of those seditious conspiracy-related cases back into next year. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=133.0s)]
*  I think what has happened here is that the congressional investigation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=139.0s)]
*  and the public hearings being held by the select committee has collided [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=142.0s)]
*  with the Justice Department's criminal investigation into the Proud Boys and the Earthkeepers [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=146.0s)]
*  and the other militia groups that actually stormed the Capitol. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=150.0s)]
*  And this has arisen because of how these two investigations have been operating, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=153.0s)]
*  The Justice Department has very strict rules about its evidence-gathering process in a criminal investigation, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=159.0s)]
*  but a congressional committee can issue subpoenas and gather witness depositions [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=164.0s)]
*  and make these transcripts whenever they like. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=170.0s)]
*  And so what the Justice Department has found is that the select committee has these thousands of transcripts, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=173.0s)]
*  and when they make that public, the federal prosecutors and the defendants were worried [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=178.0s)]
*  that that might taint the jury pool, and this is the extraordinary situation you have today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=182.0s)]
*  This afternoon, of course, the January 6 committee is set to hold its fifth public hearing, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=188.0s)]
*  and probably the last one for a few weeks. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=192.0s)]
*  We know broadly it's going to be about Trump's efforts to pressure the Department of Justice. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=194.0s)]
*  Hugo, what will you be looking for this afternoon? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=199.0s)]
*  Well, the one thing I will be looking for is the mention of presidential pardons being sought by Republican members of Congress, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=202.0s)]
*  not least Scott Perry, who was involved, who will manage to get himself involved in Trump's pressure campaign on DOJ. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=208.0s)]
*  I think this has been teased from the very first hearing when the vice chair, Liz Cheney, said, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=215.0s)]
*  you know, this was coming up in a future hearing and no one really knew when, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=220.0s)]
*  but it sounds like that will be today, the moment we've all been waiting for. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=223.0s)]
*  But the hearing today is going to be more widely focused on Trump's abuse, I guess, of the presidency, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=227.0s)]
*  to try and bend the DOJ to his will and to get DOJ to endorse his claims of election fraud [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=235.0s)]
*  and open investigations into elections in battleground states that he lost. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=243.0s)]
*  And it's going to be like the greatest hits of everything that Trump was trying to get DOJ to do, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=248.0s)]
*  like, you know, he was trying to coerce top officials like Jeffrey Rosen, Richard Donahue, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=253.0s)]
*  to sign on for letters and send them to Georgia and other states. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=257.0s)]
*  And when they refused, he threatened to fire them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=261.0s)]
*  And he tried to introduce this loyalist, Jeffrey Clark, to the top position at justice. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=263.0s)]
*  And so I think we're going to see all of that today. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=270.0s)]
*  Jeff Rosen and Richard Donahue, of course, are both testifying publicly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=272.0s)]
*  And Hugo, briefly, the committee suggested that there could be at least two more hearings, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=276.0s)]
*  but wouldn't happen until July. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=280.0s)]
*  Give us the reason for the postponement and what other topics they want to cover. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=282.0s)]
*  Well, the reason they're giving publicly, at least, is that they're getting this deluge of new information. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=286.0s)]
*  It's not exactly clear how much that actually factored into the decision-making. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=290.0s)]
*  But either way, the result of this is that we are going to get the final two hearings and possibly more now in mid-July. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=296.0s)]
*  The House returns after its recess July 12. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=304.0s)]
*  So for all the Congress watchers out there, I'd say you could probably mark your calendars that week that we might get more hearings. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=307.0s)]
*  Chairman Thompson said yesterday there might be more than two. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=315.0s)]
*  So we've definitely got the two ones that were scheduled coming up. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=318.0s)]
*  So that's going to be the hearing on the power boys and the other extremist groups and stop the steal, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=321.0s)]
*  as well as what Trump was doing in the White House during the Capitol attack. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=326.0s)]
*  All right. Well, Hugo Lowell, we really appreciate it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=331.0s)]
*  And of course, we will have complete coverage here on MSNBC of the hearing this afternoon. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=334.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nHNAcCgdeY&t=351.0s)]
