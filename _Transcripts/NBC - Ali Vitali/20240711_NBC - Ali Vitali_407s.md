# House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to relay caucus' concerns to Biden
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0)
*  Amid growing questions about President Biden's candidacy, House Democratic leader Hakeem [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeffries will relay his caucus's concerns to the president directly, four sources confirming [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=4.78s)]
*  that to NBC News. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=11.4s)]
*  Despite this, Jeffries is still publicly downplaying the turmoil within the party. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=13.16s)]
*  But that is not stopping some Democrats from talking to reporters. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=17.8s)]
*  Take a listen to some of their conflicting messages. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=21.64s)]
*  Now as we look forward, I just want the best person to be front and center to take us into [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=25.2s)]
*  the next administration, into the 119th Congress, so that we can get more done. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=31.56s)]
*  And do you believe, final question, that person is President Biden? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=36.0s)]
*  Well, I think it remains to be seen. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=38.8s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=40.56s)]
*  And I think we'll know that here soon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=42.68s)]
*  We have to protect the White House. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=44.28s)]
*  We have to win back the House majority. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=48.04s)]
*  Make Hakeem Jeffries the next speaker, protect the Senate, and deliver for the American people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=50.6s)]
*  And do you think, considering the high stakes of this election, do you think that Joe Biden [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=55.0s)]
*  is the best person to be at the top of the table? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=58.72s)]
*  President Joe Biden is the number one. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=60.92s)]
*  I think everyone has concerns, and I think we've raised those, but I just don't think [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=62.52s)]
*  we need to play them out publicly. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=67.28s)]
*  I do think that there are concerns. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=68.68s)]
*  I don't think you can get around that, and I don't think that they're just of a small, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=70.44s)]
*  elite few. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=74.44s)]
*  I think that they're significant concerns from people across the country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=75.44s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Ali Vitale. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=79.72s)]
*  Ali, good morning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=83.72s)]
*  Long day on the Hill yesterday, another long one ahead today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=85.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=88.4s)]
*  We had a few more Democratic lawmakers come out yesterday, including our first senator, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=89.4s)]
*  to say that President Biden should not be atop the ticket. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  A lot of eyes will be on Biden's news conference today, slated at 5.30 p.m. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=96.48s)]
*  There are many hours between now and then. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=100.84s)]
*  What are we expecting from the Hill? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=103.88s)]
*  A lot of hours between now and then, and it's a flyout day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=104.88s)]
*  So for members who might be mulling, is today the day that I come forward? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=107.52s)]
*  It's a question of, do they do it while they're here in town? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=110.98s)]
*  Do they do it when they're back home in their districts? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=113.04s)]
*  Because you know, next week, it's not only Republican National Convention, members are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=114.84s)]
*  home. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=118.64s)]
*  No one's in Congress. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=119.64s)]
*  It's a recess week. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=120.64s)]
*  It should be a week and a moment for contrast, and instead, it could be a moment of continued [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=121.64s)]
*  turmoil for Democrats. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=125.52s)]
*  I think the striking thing, and you and I were talking about this, is the fact that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=126.76s)]
*  on Tuesday, after everyone met on the Democratic side, House members huddled with House members, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=129.78s)]
*  Senate during their lunch, it did sort of feel like, okay, Michael Bennet's going to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=134.88s)]
*  come out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=138.4s)]
*  We're going to see Mikey Sherrill come out. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=139.4s)]
*  But by and large, this feels like it's dissipating. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=140.92s)]
*  And then on Wednesday, former speaker Nancy Pelosi came on Morning Joe. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=143.72s)]
*  And that really was a moment where people know that she was deliberate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=147.88s)]
*  I have one lawmaker who told me there's nothing that she does by accident, and certainly she's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=151.0s)]
*  someone that the caucus listens to, despite the fact that she's no longer in an official [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=154.84s)]
*  leadership capacity. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=159.2s)]
*  She is very much a thought leader in this party, and many members have said to me, as [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=160.62s)]
*  I'm sure they've said to you, they think she is one of a select group of people who could [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=163.96s)]
*  potentially talk to the president or at least signal to him in some kind of subtle or not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=168.08s)]
*  so subtle way that they want him to reconsider the decision that he has, as you rightly point [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=172.52s)]
*  out, already made that he's staying in the race. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=177.0s)]
*  We could end up seeing more members now that NATO is ending, start coming out today. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=180.0s)]
*  At the same time, the longer this drags out, and this is the question I was asking lawmakers [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=184.52s)]
*  yesterday, how much longer can you do this before you just utterly kneecapped the nominee, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=188.88s)]
*  especially if it remains Joe Biden? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=193.6s)]
*  We just had that sound from Congressman Jayapal saying, look, these are legitimate conversations, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=195.76s)]
*  but we should keep them behind closed doors. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=201.04s)]
*  That's not what's happened. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=202.56s)]
*  This is very much spilled out into the public, and at this point, there's polling that suggests [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=203.56s)]
*  it's the talk about Biden, the talk about the debate that's more damaging to the president [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=207.96s)]
*  than the debate was itself. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=212.36s)]
*  That's not shocking, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=213.36s)]
*  Especially because so much of this coverage, and I've thought a lot about the way that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=215.16s)]
*  we've been covering this, it's because the public doesn't necessarily match what's privately [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=218.68s)]
*  happening and the conversations that we're having that are not yet reportable, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=223.08s)]
*  There is so much panic, and people don't want to put their names on it yet. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=227.16000000000003s)]
*  And yes, as it drags on longer, maybe some of them will. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  But when you have that level of freak out within elected ranks, and it doesn't translate [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=233.44s)]
*  publicly, sometimes it might feel like we're making it bigger than it is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=238.28s)]
*  But no, it is the only thing that people on the Hill are talking about, whether you want [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=242.08s)]
*  to blame the press for it, as one senator did with me yesterday, or not. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  This is not us. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=249.34s)]
*  This is the party actively grappling with that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=250.34s)]
*  A truism in this race is whatever candidates dominate the news is losing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=252.96s)]
*  And I think Democrats and Biden's senior advisor told me yesterday they're desperate to turn [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=256.92s)]
*  the page in part because next week the focus will finally be on Trump again. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  He's going to announce his VP pick. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=264.44s)]
*  It's the convention, a chance where Democrats feel like, well, Trump maybe could damage [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=265.92s)]
*  himself. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=269.8s)]
*  So does that mean that this has to come to a conclusion by this weekend or no? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=270.8s)]
*  It should. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=275.6s)]
*  I mean, if you want that contrast to be as stark as I know that Democrats want it to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=276.6s)]
*  be, but that's not necessarily what's going to happen, especially if you start getting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=280.8s)]
*  members who, after the NATO press conference today, decide they want to come forward on [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  Friday, maybe on Saturday, maybe on Sunday. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=288.2s)]
*  Look, the Republican National Convention, this is also a fear that I have heard from [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=290.32s)]
*  some Democratic electeds, this idea that they want Trump to be out there talking about taking [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=293.6s)]
*  credit for stripping abortion protections and abortion access from women across the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=298.0s)]
*  country. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=302.28s)]
*  They want him talking about that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=303.28s)]
*  They want the conversation on Project 2025. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=304.28s)]
*  They want the conversation around whoever his running mate is because they have done [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=306.48s)]
*  a lot of work to try to show that these options are, in the Democrats' words, extreme. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=309.12s)]
*  People like JD Vance, people like others, and they might not get the chance to do that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=313.92s)]
*  So we're still waiting to hear more publicly from Senate Majority Leader Schumer. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=317.64s)]
*  You mentioned Pelosi as someone the president will listen to. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=322.36s)]
*  Schumer falls into that category as well. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=325.04s)]
*  What's the latest as to where he is right now? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=327.44s)]
*  Well, look, there was reporting last night that ultimately Schumer came out on the record [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=328.96s)]
*  in rebuffed saying that he was trying to leave no daylight between him and his support of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=333.12s)]
*  President Joe Biden. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=337.0s)]
*  He has been, we'll say, tight lipped in terms of how verbose he has been in talking about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=338.44s)]
*  his support of Biden with us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=343.56s)]
*  But we know that Senate Democrats are going to have a special lunch today. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=345.23999999999995s)]
*  They're going to be meeting at the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee office with top [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  members of the Biden campaign apparatus, get walked through some polls, get walked through [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  some data, all of it, again, meant to be part of the reassuring process. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  We are now squarely in week two of this, though. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=359.58s)]
*  And there are senators who say they wish all this had happened sooner. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  There are senators who badly want to be reassured. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=365.56s)]
*  I think that's the thing here is everyone wants to be reassured. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=368.24s)]
*  They'd like to come down on the point where they can say President Biden's a nominee. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=370.76s)]
*  She's not there yet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3b5yF9E0j0&t=373.8s)]
