# Trump falsely claims Harris is off the campaign trail: 'She's lazy as hell'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8)
*  Welcome back. Donald Trump unveiled a new line of personal and ugly attacks against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris yesterday, calling her lazy. The former president made the comment [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=6.12s)]
*  during a roundtable event with Latino voters in Miami and falsely claimed his opponent [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=13.44s)]
*  has not been on the campaign trail. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  I was going to hit her really hard on the trail today, but now I don't have to because [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=22.96s)]
*  she's off. She's off. No, I can't get over it. Who the hell takes off? You have 14 days [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=27.52s)]
*  left and she'll take a couple of more days off too. You know why? She's lazy as hell [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=34.32s)]
*  and she's got that reputation. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, co-host of the weekend on MSNBC, Simone Sanders Townsend. Simone, always [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=41.72s)]
*  good to see you. We should note first as a fact check, Vice President Harris did a series [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=47.32s)]
*  of interviews yesterday and back on the campaign trail today and heard she's had an absolute [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=51.44s)]
*  relentless pace in recent weeks. So with that as the backdrop, what do you make if [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=56.32s)]
*  Trump's comments? Lazy there? Feels like a trope. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=61.3s)]
*  It does feel like a trope, Jonathan. And you know, I do believe that in some respects Donald [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=65.8s)]
*  Trump knows exactly what he's doing. He would love for the vice president and her campaign [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=72.06s)]
*  and even us in the media apparatus to spend time talking about his attacks against the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=78.4s)]
*  vice president, calling her out of her name, mispronouncing her name, calling her lazy, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=84.98s)]
*  which is in fact a trope. I think if we really look at the schedules of the two candidates [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=89.7s)]
*  here and the aggressive nature of the schedules, Donald Trump is the person that comes out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=95.06s)]
*  looking like the lighter schedule, looking lazy and his own aides told folks at Politico [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=99.82000000000001s)]
*  I do believe that he is exhausted. Okay, so let's just put the facts on the table. But [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=105.62s)]
*  he would love for folks to talk about that and not about where he stands on the abortion [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=110.9s)]
*  amendment in Florida. He doesn't want folks to talk about his economic policies and how [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=116.54s)]
*  even the head of Bloomberg admonished his unbelievable stance as it relates to tariffs. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't want folks to talk about the issues because the issues are not great for him. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  This other battleground that the Republican apparatus likes to fight on, which I call [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=132.9s)]
*  the cultural wars, they are a distraction but they are in fact their playbook. So Simone, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=137.9s)]
*  let's talk about the map. Seven battleground states, just mentioned a short time ago, per [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  some polling, Democratic polling, all of them within the margin of just one, two points [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  or so. Right now, Democrats you speak to and speak to all the time. Which states does the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=152.94s)]
*  Harris team feel best about? Which ones are they worried about? Well, I will note that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=157.58s)]
*  the Harris folks, they all, I mean you know as well because you're talking to them, they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  are very not overconfident at all, very demure as the young folks might say, very mindful [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=167.04s)]
*  about seeming overconfident or seeming like they feel like anywhere they have it in the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  bag. They really feel like they need to compete on every single ground and that they have [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=179.56s)]
*  their targets and because of the infrastructure specifically that the campaign has built in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=184.04s)]
*  state by state in key districts, they believe they'll be able to close the gaps and be successful [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  on election day. The Harris campaign also believes it's going to be close. I know a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  lot of folks out there, voters especially, Democrats keep saying, oh well what if it's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  really a big gap and the polls aren't telling the truth, it just feels like there's so much [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=202.92s)]
*  energy. It feels like a lot of people are early voting and they are, which is excellent, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=206.2s)]
*  right? I think it's a, this is a residual from the pandemic. So 18 million people that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=211.0s)]
*  I last checked have early voted thus far in this election. However, all of those early [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=217.72s)]
*  votes are not Democrats and there are still going to be even more people that vote on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=222.4s)]
*  election day. So the campaign is taking the stance that they're going to win this, how [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=226.28s)]
*  you win a presidential, congressional district by congressional district, state by state [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=231.32s)]
*  and checking that early voter data and cross and overlaying it with their targets and they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  think that they've got a winning strategy here. So let's get your analysis here. The [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=241.88s)]
*  Harris team has spent a lot of time in recent days focused on Republicans for event with [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=245.72s)]
*  Liz Cheney, just one example of that. Is that the right play? Is there risks though that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=250.52s)]
*  they're focusing on those voters rather than just simply trying to turn out the base? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  Look, I am someone that personally believes, Jonathan, you have to have a both and strategy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=259.64s)]
*  You cannot do it either or Republicans are going to be a key part of Vice President Harris's [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  coalition if she is successful. Base Democratic voters though are also going to be a key part [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=268.76s)]
*  of her coalition. There are not enough Republican voters, moderate independents, if you will, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=274.6s)]
*  pardon me, to win her this race. She cannot win without base voters. And so what we saw last [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  week from the Vice President, I think was a deep dive into base voters, right? Now this week we are [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=286.76s)]
*  seeing a reach out to these Nikki Haley voters and probably some more independent voters who [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  have yet to make up their decision, which they do exist. One of my students at Georgetown, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=299.96s)]
*  I'm a fellow this semester, and she and her mother went and knocked doors in rural Pennsylvania on [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=303.32s)]
*  Sunday. And she came back and she said, I have, I did, I found people that are actually undecided [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=306.92s)]
*  in this election. So they're out there and what she is doing this week can make a difference for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  them. I don't think that we, and let's not forget, Governor Walz is on the campaign trail, President [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=316.44s)]
*  Obama is on the campaign trail. There are lots of folks who are out there on the Vice President and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=321.48s)]
*  all of the Vice President's behalf, but I don't think there's any stand in for the candidate [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=327.56s)]
*  herself. So I think that we do need to see another town hall like atmosphere, like we saw with Liz [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=331.64s)]
*  Cheney the other day with some base Democratic voters. I know she's doing a town hall this evening [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=339.4s)]
*  on another network, so we'll see what that looks like, but she's not leaving anything on the field [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=343.72s)]
*  and that's necessary if she wants to be successful. And look, I think that the Vice President herself [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=347.72s)]
*  has done the work. Now the voters will see if they're feeling what she's putting down. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=353.24s)]
*  And we should note of course that town hall tonight scheduled in place of what would have been [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=358.04s)]
*  her second debate with Donald Trump, except Donald Trump backed out. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bHA1XkaWc8&t=362.44s)]
