# Georgia sets new early voting turnout record
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY)
*  Georgia has smashed another early voting record. With a week to go until election day, 40% of all active voters in that battleground state have already cast a ballot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=0.0s)]
*  That announcement comes from the Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger yesterday. Nearly 3 million Georgians have already cast ballots, either in person or absentee. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=10.0s)]
*  That blows away the past records set in 2020 by about 1 million voters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=19.0s)]
*  Both campaigns have spent significant resources in Georgia, a key swing state that is a crucial pickup in the race for the White House. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=24.0s)]
*  Joining us now, managing editor at the Bullork, Sam Stein. Sam, let's forget about the election and just talk about the Yankees being down three games to none. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=32.0s)]
*  I don't want to jinx it, you know, but it's been glorious. So far, so far, so good. But we'll put an end to that for now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=39.0s)]
*  Let's talk about these early voting results. Georgia, we just highlighted, but we're getting them from a number of the battleground states. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=47.0s)]
*  Is there anything, any lessons we should take from right now? No. Okay. Give us a little more than that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=54.0s)]
*  I just think if you're going to be analyzing early voting, you're probably going to be disappointed in some way. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=61.0s)]
*  Past is prologue here. We thought Hillary Clinton was going to crush Florida because of early voting trends there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=66.0s)]
*  I will say if there's one larger thing, it's the engagement seems pretty high. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=72.0s)]
*  But that could be because Donald Trump has encouraged Republicans to actually engage in early voting. Right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=77.0s)]
*  So we just don't quite know what these trends say. I will say the one state where we do have some sort of indication is Nevada. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=82.0s)]
*  Republicans have done really well in person and rural votes particularly well. Democrats are waiting for Clark County. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=90.0s)]
*  They're stronghold to come in, but it hasn't yet. Talk to campaign folks and Democrats. They still think it's going to be okay in the state. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=98.0s)]
*  But those larger trends are that Republicans are engaged earlier. It doesn't mean necessarily they're going to win, but they are engaged early. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=105.0s)]
*  Right. We don't know is there these early votes, new votes, or they simply people who normally would have voted on Election Day. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=111.0s)]
*  So therefore you're cannibalizing that total. Just don't get too excited about it. I agree. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=115.0s)]
*  There's a limit to what we should read into it. But let's talk about the map. Sure. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=120.0s)]
*  You know, there's some sense among Democrats that the battlegrounds they're feeling most anxious about are North Carolina and Arizona. Right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=124.0s)]
*  But they still feel they're in this with Nevada, as you just said, Georgia, and the Blue Wall still seems to be the best. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah, I keep talking to people and really the Blue Wall. Honestly, it's kind of funny because this was the Biden path and it's probably going to be her path. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=138.0s)]
*  If she if she can pull it off, people are comfortable about Michigan and Minnesota, Minnesota. Sorry, Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=144.0s)]
*  Look at me. I'm too tired. And then Pennsylvania, of course, is the big one. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=151.0s)]
*  That's their comfort zone. Obviously, if they can pick off a Georgia or North Carolina, that'd be great. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=155.0s)]
*  That but everything with the Omaha district in Nebraska and you get to 270. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=160.0s)]
*  And so it is a bit poetic that she could end up getting there through the Biden path. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm actually traveling with with President Biden later today. He's got an infrastructure event in Baltimore. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=170.0s)]
*  But you have to wonder stuck with Joe after all. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=174.0s)]
*  Well, you have I was going to say I've talked to some in the West Wing who note that her likely most most likely path is the Blue Wall. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=177.0s)]
*  And what is your closing argument? Democracy. I mean, why do I even change in midstream? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=183.0s)]
*  They should have just stuck with the guy. Yeah, I'm not sure. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=188.0s)]
*  The polls reflected that. Let's talk about where the Republicans stand right now because it's you know, they are dealing with the fallout from the MSG rally. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=191.0s)]
*  That was quite a rally. The it certainly was. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=200.0s)]
*  And more to highlight than just that one comment from that comedian. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=203.0s)]
*  But there's still a lot of confidence projection there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=207.0s)]
*  Now, I think this is this is sort of how it always works. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=209.0s)]
*  Democrats are anxious because they want to motivate their voters out of out of worry and fear. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=212.0s)]
*  Republicans like to be overconfident in part because Trump demands it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=216.0s)]
*  But also, how much of this is do you think them setting the stage? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=219.0s)]
*  Look, we're going to win. We're going to win big. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=222.0s)]
*  So therefore, if they lose, that fuels into the idea that, hey, this was stolen, rigged. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=224.0s)]
*  Right. I thought about that. I think some of it is just pure psychology. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=229.0s)]
*  Right. Like they boast. They're extremely confident. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=233.0s)]
*  Democrats are predisposed to anxiety, like severe anxiety. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=236.0s)]
*  I saw some quotes this morning where Trump people were like, we've never seen data this good. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=241.0s)]
*  And maybe so. But I do think part of it is also laying the predicate for if they do not win, they can challenge the result and say it's rigged. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=246.0s)]
*  And so that is obviously foreboding. Right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=254.0s)]
*  I saw a tweet from Elon Musk last night where he was talking about the early voting data, which we just said, don't trust any early voting data. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=256.0s)]
*  And he's like, we're on to some sort of like cosmic and grand victory. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=263.0s)]
*  And I was like, wow, this guy's conditioning all of his followers, millions and millions of people to expect some huge victory in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=267.0s)]
*  And it doesn't happen. Imagine the reaction to that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=273.0s)]
*  Yeah, I it does seem like they're scary. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=276.0s)]
*  They're laying some groundwork for exactly that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=278.0s)]
*  And we as the vice president will surely note tonight from the ellipse. The last time this happened, there was violence. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=280.0s)]
*  I remember that. Not good. No, not good at all. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=285.0s)]
*  It's that kind of analysis that we turn to you for. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=288.0s)]
*  Hey, anytime, man. Come back to D.C. Sam Stein, managing editor at the Bullwork. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=290.0s)]
*  Sam, we really appreciate it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=295.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqd1kId0fiY&t=315.0s)]
