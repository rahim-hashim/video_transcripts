# House GOP unveils debt ceiling legislation
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok)
*  Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced the GOP plan to tackle the debt ceiling crisis yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=0.0s)]
*  The bill would raise the debt limit by $1.5 trillion over the next year or so. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=8.0s)]
*  The GOP plan includes bringing non-defense spending down to 2022 levels and capping future spending growth at 1% annually. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=14.0s)]
*  The bill would rescind unspent COVID-19 funds, ban President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan, repeal a whole host of green energy tax credits, kill new funding for the IRS, and it would also introduce new work requirements for some federal aid programs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=24.0s)]
*  McCarthy claims that this in total will save the country $4.5 trillion. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=43.0s)]
*  During his announcement, the speaker also took time to criticize President Biden's actions on the debt. Take a listen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=50.0s)]
*  When President Biden and Senate Democrats waste time, House Republicans are taking action. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=58.0s)]
*  President Biden has a choice. Come to the table and stop playing partisan political games. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=65.0s)]
*  Or cover his ears, refuse to negotiate, and risk bumbling his way into the first default in our nation's history. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=74.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael Shtell. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=86.0s)]
*  Michael, great to see you again this morning. So we all know that McCarthy's margin for error in his own conference, very, very slim. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=92.0s)]
*  Tell us the initial reaction from the disparate parts of the House GOP to the debt ceiling bill. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=99.0s)]
*  Do we think there's going to be enough votes here to pass it? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=106.0s)]
*  Jonathan, that's the key detail here is that House Republicans have an extremely slim majority in the House. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=109.0s)]
*  They can only afford to lose four votes, assuming that all Democrats vote against this debt limit proposal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=114.0s)]
*  And look, right now it's murky because yesterday, right when this bill came out, a lot of lawmakers told us up on Capitol Hill that they are still going through the specifics of this bill. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=120.0s)]
*  It spans 320 pages. There are a lot of provisions in there. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=129.0s)]
*  So lawmakers were quick to say that they're still going through this bill. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=134.0s)]
*  But in terms of reaction to it, it was pretty strong among House Republicans to begin with. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=137.0s)]
*  Bob Good, who is a conservative Republican, he was one of the holdouts during the speaker race back in January. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=142.0s)]
*  He said that he thinks that this can get to 218. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=148.0s)]
*  Some other conservative firebrands said that they were happy with what they see so far. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=151.0s)]
*  And that's also because let's if you go into the details of what's in this proposal, as you outlined just before, this talks about about four point five trillion dollars in spending, which was a requirement among those conservative House Republicans that any increase in the debt ceiling is paired with spending cuts. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=155.0s)]
*  And there are also a number of policy provisions in there. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=172.0s)]
*  You talked about the repeal of IRS spending. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=175.0s)]
*  You talked about increased work requirements. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=177.0s)]
*  These were things that were added in the final stage of negotiations in an effort to get some of these conservative holdouts on board. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=179.0s)]
*  So to get back to the question and the important one here, will it pass? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=187.0s)]
*  That still remains to be seen just because we still need lawmakers to come out and say how they're feeling. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=190.0s)]
*  There are some, though, that aren't liking what they're seeing. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=195.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Nancy Mace told reporters yesterday that she's leaning no right now, but she still has to go over the details. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=198.0s)]
*  I think we'll get to see a better picture of if this can reach 218 votes later today. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=204.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the clock certainly is ticking on the debt ceiling. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=209.0s)]
*  Some estimations that the nation may hit its limit by early summer, just a couple of months away. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=211.0s)]
*  Michael, let's revisit the other headline here from the Hill, which is today's House Judiciary Committee hearing with Mark Pomerantz, the former ADA, who wrote a book about the Trump case there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=217.0s)]
*  What are we? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=228.0s)]
*  What are we looking for? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=229.0s)]
*  Yeah. So this was a really big win for the House Judiciary Committee as part of their investigation into Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, specifically his investigation into former President Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=230.0s)]
*  The committee had subpoenaed Michael, Mark Pomerantz, who had previously worked in the DA's office on an investigation into Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=241.0s)]
*  And as you mentioned, he resigned in protest because he believed that the DA was not going to go ahead and indict Trump for as part of the investigation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=250.0s)]
*  So what are we going to look out for today? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=259.0s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see exactly what the committee is looking to hear from Pomerantz, because, again, this is somebody who worked on the investigation and believed that Trump should face charges for the hush money payments. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=262.0s)]
*  This was somebody who was a key, played a key role in the investigation. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=277.0s)]
*  So, A, I'm looking to see what Pomerantz will say as part of this step, as part of his testimony. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=281.0s)]
*  But B, it'll be interesting to see where the House Judiciary Committee goes from here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=287.0s)]
*  Of course, this has been part of a growing investigation into Bragg in response that comes amid his charges against former President Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=291.0s)]
*  Obviously, in the beginning of this week, we saw the Judiciary Committee hold a hearing in Manhattan, in Bragg's backyard, talking about crime in New York City. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=300.0s)]
*  So I think that this is a big step for the Judiciary Committee, and it'll be interesting to see where Jim Jordan takes the investigation from here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=309.0s)]
*  All right. We'll be watching for that later today. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=316.0s)]
*  Congressional reporter for The Hill, Michael Shtell, thank you as always. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=318.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haUVRTKCmok&t=330.0s)]
