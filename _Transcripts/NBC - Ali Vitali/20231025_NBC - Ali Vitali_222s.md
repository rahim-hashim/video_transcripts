# DeSantis on Trump: 'Lost the zip on his fastball'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg)
*  Trump does now, he is wedded to the teleprompter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=0.0s)]
*  He can't get off that teleprompter. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Anytime he does, he says things like, don't vote. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=7.32s)]
*  He's telling people not to vote, like we have all the votes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=10.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=12.72s)]
*  Like, wait a minute, you lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=13.72s)]
*  You don't have all the votes you need. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=16.92s)]
*  And so I think that it's just shown this is a different Donald Trump than 2015 and 16. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=19.0s)]
*  Lost the zip on his fastball, has a sense of entitlement. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=25.12s)]
*  All this stuff doesn't think he has to go through and earn it like other candidates. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=29.12s)]
*  Well that was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis yesterday in New Hampshire attacking Donald [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=34.32s)]
*  Trump's age and his cognitive abilities. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, a man with his cognitive abilities intact, politics reporter for Semaphore, Dave [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=41.88s)]
*  Weigel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=46.44s)]
*  Dave, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=47.44s)]
*  So we have in recent days been cataloging Trump's misstatements, shall we say, of late. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=48.44s)]
*  But let's be clear, polls show that he is 40 to 50 points ahead of his closest opponent [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=55.0s)]
*  in the GOP presidential primary. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=60.52s)]
*  Do you think an argument like this from DeSantis makes one bit of difference? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=62.88s)]
*  Nothing really has. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=68.92s)]
*  And for a lot of people, if you tuned out of the primary after Trump was indicted and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=69.92s)]
*  did not dip in the polls, you're like a lot of Republican voters. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=74.08s)]
*  The decision to endorse and support somebody who seems that he's under attack by the establishment, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=78.6s)]
*  an argument that DeSantis validated by offering Trump sanctuary in Florida, if you remember, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=85.55999999999999s)]
*  that really kind of froze the primary. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=90.64s)]
*  So every argument has gone under that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Every argument about Trump's electability is subsumed by the Republicans' belief that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=94.94s)]
*  if he was not electable, if he was not going to beat Joe Biden, he would not be in such [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=98.96s)]
*  trouble. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  I finally put out that polling has also found, as reliable as it is at this point in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=105.76s)]
*  election, that Ron DeSantis doesn't do any better than Donald Trump against Joe Biden. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  So the arguments he's making don't resonate with Republican voters. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=115.56s)]
*  Dave, I want to put you a theory. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=118.84s)]
*  A Republican, a senior Republican said to me in recent days that there's been this belief [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=120.4s)]
*  that if Trump's the nominee, that if he's in a courtroom all of next year, that's going [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  to be really, really stunning to the American people and they'll break away from that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=128.04000000000002s)]
*  Those independents won't want to side with him. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=131.78s)]
*  Is there a possibility that this strategy here by the Trump team just put him in court [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=134.12s)]
*  a lot this year, so therefore the shock value goes away and we're desensitized to it? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=137.96s)]
*  Well, they've been trying to push as much as they can past 2024 into the next year, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=142.76s)]
*  into a period, frankly, when they believe he might be president, he could pardon himself. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=149.36s)]
*  The campaign has just made use of the misfortunes that have come its way. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=154.4s)]
*  And Trump has been able to dominate the conversation inside this primary by giving a few comments [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=160.4s)]
*  to reporters on the way into the courtroom. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=165.44s)]
*  So they don't want this to be happening right now, but this is a unique primary. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=168.16s)]
*  We have not had a former president who most of the base believes won the last election [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=172.96s)]
*  run for the nomination ever, if you include that second part. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=177.76s)]
*  And so the base does not need, the primary voting base does not need to see as much of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=181.12s)]
*  Donald Trump as it needs to see from these other candidates. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=186.74s)]
*  It hasn't helped, they would love for him to not be in court. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=189.48s)]
*  The status quo where he is in legal trouble but they're pushing back with appeals is better [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=193.0s)]
*  for them than what's going on right now, but they'll take what's going on now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuGkQYtTXPg&t=198.64s)]
