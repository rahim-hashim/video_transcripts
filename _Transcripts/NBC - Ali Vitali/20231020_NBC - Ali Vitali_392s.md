# Third House Speaker vote scheduled for Friday
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ)
*  The path to a new House Speaker for Republicans remains very uncertain this morning, following [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a series of surprise and chaotic developments. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  First, there is a new House vote for Speaker scheduled at 10 a.m. Eastern today, setting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=10.52s)]
*  up Republican Congressman Jim Jordan's third attempt to win over the required 217 votes [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=15.4s)]
*  he needs to secure the gavel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=21.8s)]
*  Now, this move comes about 24 hours after the Ohio Congressman said he would support [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=23.799999999999997s)]
*  temporarily empowering interim Speaker Patrick McHenry of North Carolina to take on the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=30.28s)]
*  Speaker's role until January. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=35.8s)]
*  That would allow legislative business to continue in the face of two wars and a looming government [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=38.44s)]
*  shutdown. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=44.16s)]
*  Jordan said he would try again for the Speakership in January. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=45.16s)]
*  However, within hours of Jordan saying that he's for McHenry, it became clear in a meeting [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=48.32s)]
*  of House Republicans that there was not enough support for that concept, and the idea stalled. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=54.04s)]
*  Since then, NBC News has learned that McHenry told Republican colleagues during that meeting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=60.68s)]
*  that he might resign as interim Speaker if Republicans pushed him to try to move legislation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=66.52s)]
*  on the floor without an explicit vote to expand his power. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=73.32s)]
*  Additionally, Jordan's meeting yesterday with the 22 Republican members who voted against [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=78.16s)]
*  him for Speaker on Wednesday broke up about an hour and a half after it started and appeared [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  to create little to no progress. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Jordan then gave this update. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  I'll just say this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=96.08s)]
*  We made the pitch to members on the resolution as a way to lower the temperature and get [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=97.08s)]
*  back to work. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=105.36s)]
*  We decided that wasn't where we're going to go. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=107.06s)]
*  I'm still running for Speaker, and I plan to go to the floor and get the votes and win [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=109.28s)]
*  this race. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=114.16s)]
*  Now, we're expecting to hear from Jordan again this morning at about 8 o'clock Eastern. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=115.16s)]
*  I delivered an update to the press just a few hours ahead of the new vote for Speaker. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  The co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer, she is an MSNBC contributor and like me is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=127.36s)]
*  probably exhausted. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=132.34s)]
*  It's hard to even recap what happened yesterday. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  We thought it was going to be Jordan. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=137.24s)]
*  Then we thought it was going to be McHenry. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=139.28s)]
*  Then McHenry threatens to quit. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=140.72s)]
*  Now maybe it's Jordan again, but he still seems short of votes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=142.76s)]
*  Recap what happened yesterday. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=147.76s)]
*  Take us behind closed doors. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=149.04s)]
*  Why are we here? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=150.64s)]
*  I mean, I think you summarized it really well in the sense of just the chaos that the House [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=153.55999999999997s)]
*  Republican Conference is right now. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=158.64s)]
*  They've tried multiple different strategies, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=161.76s)]
*  Whether they have tried to have Jim Jordan run for Speaker, who's only lost votes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=164.88s)]
*  The hardening of Republicans against Jim Jordan cannot be overstated. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  I think there is a massive amount of frustration among the Republican Conference, but you still [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  have that right flank, the Freedom Caucus members that ousted Kevin McCarthy that are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=180.88s)]
*  we're not happy with this kind of compromise strategy of having Patrick McHenry serve as [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=186.88s)]
*  kind of a placeholder because they couldn't get to that magic 217. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=193.04s)]
*  Frustrations are running very, very high. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=198.88s)]
*  There's a lot of anger right now because not only is just the kind of pressure campaign [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  that they all feel, I think there is a sense that they are just in complete disarray with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=209.04s)]
*  no strategy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  They're getting pressure by Sean Hannity and other kind of right wing conservatives on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  the outside, which has never really been a strategy that works. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=220.24s)]
*  And I think the third thing, more than anything, is the fact that you don't have any momentum [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  by Jordan. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=229.12s)]
*  These people potentially lose votes on the House floor today. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=230.12s)]
*  And there was kind of a collective groan yesterday when one of the members said, hey, we're going [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=235.0s)]
*  to come and vote all weekend and not just by the lawmakers, but by the press corps and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  everyone else. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=242.28s)]
*  And to that frustration, there were reports yesterday of people shouting at Matt Gaetz, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=243.28s)]
*  blaming him for the predicament that we're in, someone even threatening to take a swing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  at him. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=250.2s)]
*  And of course, we heard last night from President Biden stressing the urgency of helping Ukraine [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=251.2s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=257.08s)]
*  Well, we can't really do that if there's no speaker. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=258.08s)]
*  So talk to us, Anna, if you will, a little bit more about what's next. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=260.48s)]
*  As you just said, this expectation that Jordan won't get to the number of votes he needs [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=265.35999999999996s)]
*  this morning. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=268.79999999999995s)]
*  So what will happen then? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=269.79999999999995s)]
*  How many more votes do we think he'll put up with? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  And if not this McHenry solution, who else could step for the forefront to run for speaker? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=274.2s)]
*  There were 17 days into not having a House speaker. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=279.28s)]
*  And as you put a fine point on it, at a time where the speaker is really needed, there's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=283.12s)]
*  going to need to be a funding bill when it comes to Israel and likely Ukraine funding. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  There's going to be government funding needed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  We are less than a month away from that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=294.96s)]
*  The government running out of money. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  And so the real question, I think the people at Pantolus keep asking is when are they going [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  to hit rock bottom? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  Because it keeps seemingly being kind of almost too fantastical to believe that we're still [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=307.11999999999995s)]
*  in this place. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=312.2s)]
*  But we are. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=313.2s)]
*  And so right now there's no other candidate that has either emerged or even been kind [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=314.44s)]
*  of floated that also would be able to get that 217 number, whether that's Jody Arrington, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=319.12s)]
*  a Republican from Texas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=325.8s)]
*  Some people have been really floating. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=327.16s)]
*  Tom Cole, the Republican from Oklahoma. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=328.36s)]
*  But nobody who is a serious candidate who's either willing to take on Jordan or even has [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=330.72s)]
*  the momentum of the entire conference. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=336.36s)]
*  I think the other thing to note, though, as much as this McHenry strategy fell apart yesterday, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=338.56s)]
*  this is kind of a moment by moment decision. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=343.96s)]
*  And any member could bring up that resolution that could force the vote on having him have [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=346.36s)]
*  expanded powers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=351.56s)]
*  And so that may, we may see that actually gain some steam here if the vote this morning [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=352.86s)]
*  is as bad as some expect. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=357.56s)]
*  So many twists and turns ahead. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=360.2s)]
*  Republicans, such a mess right now. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=362.52s)]
*  Co-founder of Punchbowl News, Anna Palmer, thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=365.44s)]
*  We of course will be staying on the speaker's race all day long here on MSNBC. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YTRreDhHlQ&t=367.84000000000003s)]
