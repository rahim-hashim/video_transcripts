# Trump trial Day 18: Cohen back on the stand
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=0.0s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is due back in the Manhattan courtroom later this morning [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=3.44s)]
*  as his criminal hush money trial resumes after being off yesterday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=7.32s)]
*  Today could very well be the trial's last day of testimony as the defense continues [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=11.84s)]
*  its cross-examination of former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=16.52s)]
*  An NBC News source with direct knowledge of what to expect says the cross-examination [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=21.68s)]
*  will focus on Cohen's past lies, including some under oath, in an attempt to discredit [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=27.36s)]
*  his testimony. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=32.84s)]
*  Cohen is the prosecutor's final witness and they are expected to rest their case after [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=34.44s)]
*  the defense is finished. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=39.44s)]
*  Trump's team said earlier this week it may not call any witnesses. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=41.32s)]
*  Trump's attorney Todd Blanche told the judge he was unsure if the former president would [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=44.96s)]
*  testify in his own defense. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=49.72s)]
*  Trump has said previously that he wants to testify but there's real skepticism about [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=52.42s)]
*  that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  Trump started his cross-examination of Cohen on Tuesday where he focused on the lawyer's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=57.28s)]
*  motives for working with prosecutors. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Quote, I was looking for a reduction in the home confinement portion, not just in this [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=64.04s)]
*  but in the work I was doing, Cohen said. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=68.84s)]
*  I did want to be released, yes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=71.16s)]
*  Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=74.12s)]
*  If found guilty, he could face prison or probation. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=77.28s)]
*  He of course has denied all charges. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=80.4s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC legal analyst Charles Coleman. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Charles, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=87.2s)]
*  So, let's start with what we should expect from this cross-examination. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=88.68s)]
*  It did begin on Tuesday, it was fairly contentious. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=92.88s)]
*  What should we look for today? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=95.76s)]
*  Well, the truth is, Jonathan, I'm not quite sure because Todd Blanche has been all over [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=96.76s)]
*  the place. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=100.68s)]
*  I do expect that there are going to be myriad attacks on Michael Cohen's out of court statements [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=101.68s)]
*  and some of the things that he has said under oath in court in testifying, both to Congress [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=106.28s)]
*  and during the trial that left him going to jail. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=111.0s)]
*  I think ultimately those are the things that the prosecution is going to seek to zero in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=113.88s)]
*  on to try and again, damage Michael Cohen's credibility in the minds of jurors as someone [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=118.16s)]
*  who should not be believed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=123.36s)]
*  And you think Cohen has done a reasonably good job so far? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=124.36s)]
*  Surprisingly so. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  He's been extremely composed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  He has not necessarily gotten into a space that has been overly combative. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=129.32s)]
*  He's defended himself, but for someone who we've seen over and over again, seem to be [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=133.36s)]
*  all over the place. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=137.8s)]
*  He has stuck to the script fairly well and I think done a really good job on the stand. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=139.04s)]
*  So let's spend an interview now assessing how the prosecution has fared to this point. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  This might be their last witness. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=147.2s)]
*  There have been some talk of maybe having a FEC expert come on one last time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=148.32s)]
*  We're not clear if that's going to happen or not. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  But in your estimation, do you think, first of all, do they need another witness or do [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=154.56s)]
*  you think they've done a good job proving their case? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=157.68s)]
*  They've done a good job. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=159.84s)]
*  I don't necessarily know that I would have ended on Michael Cohen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=160.92s)]
*  I think I would have stacked the order a bit differently. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=163.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the case you have is dependent on the facts that you're working [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=166.84s)]
*  with. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=171.04s)]
*  I think that the issue that the prosecution may have is that this is a legal theory that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=172.04s)]
*  is a little bit complicated. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=175.68s)]
*  Hush money, hush payments, those are not illegal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=177.68s)]
*  NDAs are not illegal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=180.72s)]
*  So explaining to the jury exactly what Donald Trump is being tried for may ultimately be [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=181.84s)]
*  a problem for the prosecution. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  But given what they have, I think they've done a solid job. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=189.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=192.24s)]
*  So let's talk about the defense's strategy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=193.24s)]
*  The Todd Blanch has just noted has not committed to calling any witnesses. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=195.72s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=199.96s)]
*  Well, what I can tell you is that he's not going to try and give the prosecution any [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=200.96s)]
*  sort of sense of who may come to the stand so that they can prepare even more than they [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=206.24s)]
*  already have. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=210.72s)]
*  He doesn't want to show his hand any earlier than he has to. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=211.72s)]
*  I also suspect that because of his client and how difficult his client is, he's getting [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  a lot of pressure internally to try and put Donald Trump on the stand. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=219.56s)]
*  He's also working with his client and trying to convince his client this is a bad idea. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  So he's not going to give the court anything more than what they absolutely need, particularly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  because he doesn't want to give the prosecution any additional advantages. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=233.2s)]
*  And at the same time, I believe that he's trying to tell his client, you do not need [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  to take the stand, even though it is your decision to do, you would be snatching an [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=241.44s)]
*  acquittal from the jaws of a potential mistrial. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=245.44s)]
*  So we should, as it sounds like, we should not rule out the possibility of a witness [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  or two appearing for the defense. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=251.56s)]
*  But let's talk a little bit more about the idea of the former president being on the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=253.12s)]
*  stand. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=256.6s)]
*  We know that he has, shall we say, a challenging relationship with the truth. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=257.6s)]
*  So he'd be real open to perjury, perhaps. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=261.04s)]
*  But it sounds like your assessment would be he would just do more harm than good to his [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=263.24s)]
*  own cause. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=267.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=268.36s)]
*  I think at this point, the prosecution has done what it can to lay its case out. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=269.36s)]
*  And there's still the potential that you might end up with a juror who doesn't buy it beyond [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  a reasonable doubt. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=277.36s)]
*  That gives them an opening for a potential mistrial with a hung jury. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=278.58s)]
*  If Donald Trump takes the stand, he significantly decreases the opportunity for that to take [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=282.2s)]
*  place. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=287.08s)]
*  And so I think that would be a terrible idea and something that could potentially tip the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=288.08s)]
*  scales really decisively in the favor of the prosecution. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=291.84s)]
*  So if things do wrap up today with the witnesses, court off tomorrow, closing arguments next [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=295.52s)]
*  week, could we have a verdict in about a week's time? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=301.52s)]
*  We could. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=303.36s)]
*  It could take longer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=304.36s)]
*  I think that a quicker verdict speaks very, very favorably toward the prosecution. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=305.36s)]
*  The longer that we go, I think that that should be an indication to most people who are observing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=310.0s)]
*  that this could end up in a potential mistrial in favor of Donald Trump. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=315.06s)]
*  So let's take a step back here as a final note. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=318.88s)]
*  This of course is just one of the four criminal cases facing Donald Trump. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=321.6s)]
*  But is it your estimation, and we're still waiting to hear from the Supreme Court, is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=326.6s)]
*  this going to be the only one that comes to trial between now and the election? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=329.96s)]
*  You know what, Jonathan, I have said and I do believe that this is likely the most ever [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=333.48s)]
*  we are going to see around Donald Trump facing accountability in a criminal court of law, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=337.92s)]
*  at least before November. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=343.32s)]
*  Depending on what happens in the election, we will then know the fate of the federal [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=345.24s)]
*  trial, but certainly the federal trials, but certainly as it pertains to anything taking [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=349.0s)]
*  place before November. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=353.84s)]
*  I think this is it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=355.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Charles Coleman. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us here on set. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=360.28s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxYzn7hUDT8&t=361.88s)]
