# Trump may try to move Georgia case to federal court
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s)
*  where we've learned that former President Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=0.0s)]
*  might try to move his pending election interference trial [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=3.2s)]
*  out of state court and into a federal one. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=7.44s)]
*  In a court filing yesterday, Trump's attorneys [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=11.34s)]
*  formally notified the judge of the possible effort [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=14.08s)]
*  to make that move, explaining that any decision [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=17.72s)]
*  must be filed within 30 days of Trump's arraignment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=21.06s)]
*  That would give the former president [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=24.92s)]
*  until the end of the month to decide [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=26.76s)]
*  how to proceed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=29.06s)]
*  Now, Trump's former White House Chief of Staff, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=30.82s)]
*  Mark Meadows, has already pushed to try to move [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=33.06s)]
*  his case to federal court and had a hearing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=36.66s)]
*  on the matter last week. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=39.9s)]
*  The judge is expected to make a ruling [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=42.14s)]
*  on the Meadows request in the near future. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NnTd32nY_s&t=44.3s)]
