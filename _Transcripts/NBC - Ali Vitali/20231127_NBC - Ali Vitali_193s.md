# Rep. George Santos says he expects to be expelled from Congress
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY)
*  From the it girl to the Mary Magdalene of the United States Congress, that's how embattled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican Congressman George Santos described his own trajectory on Capitol Hill during [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  a defiant speech Friday night, a speech that was sprinkled with taunts and obscenities [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=11.64s)]
*  aimed at his fellow lawmakers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Santos went on to say he expects to be expelled when the House votes on the matter, which [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=20.36s)]
*  is likely to happen later this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=24.66s)]
*  But Santos, at least, is suggesting he doesn't seem to care. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=27.96s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  You want to expel me, I'll wear it like a badge of honor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=34.64s)]
*  I'll be the sixth expelled member of Congress in the history of Congress. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=37.52s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=43.92s)]
*  I'll be the only one expelled without a conviction. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now, co-founder of Punch Bowl News, Jake Sherman. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=50.32s)]
*  He's also an MSNBC political contributor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=53.52s)]
*  Jake, good to see you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=56.32s)]
*  So let's just start there with Santos. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=57.48s)]
*  Did anything he say strike you as actually noteworthy? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=60.44s)]
*  And secondly, what are the mechanics about how he will be expelled this week? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=64.2s)]
*  Well, I don't know what he means by the it girl or whatever. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=69.12s)]
*  I mean, he was a backbench member of Congress who's been here for a year. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=72.64s)]
*  There was nothing notable about George Santos besides the allegations that are stunning. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=78.72s)]
*  And by the way, John, it reported in rich detail in an ethics committee report that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=87.0s)]
*  was out this week. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=93.04s)]
*  So I mean, we're not talking about the second coming of Lyndon Baines Johnson here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=94.12s)]
*  We're talking about a member of Congress who is really enmeshed in a serious legal battle [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=98.24s)]
*  right now with the ethics committee, number one, and the Department of Justice, which [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=105.72s)]
*  is indicted him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=109.6s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=110.6s)]
*  Number two, there's been an expulsion resolution filed against Santos. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  Some member of Congress will have to raise that as privileged, which begins the clock [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=117.44s)]
*  ticking on a vote. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=121.92s)]
*  So that could happen Wednesday or Thursday, the vote. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=126.12s)]
*  Santos could resign beforehand. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=129.16s)]
*  He seems to be indicating in that Twitter space or X space that he's not going to do [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=130.78s)]
*  so. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=135.68s)]
*  So that means he's going to be expelled, which, by the way, narrows the majority once again. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=136.68s)]
*  And then just to add, John, if Bill Johnson of Ohio, who recently accepted the job to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=140.94s)]
*  be president of Youngstown State University, if he goes, and then if December 8th is the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=147.82s)]
*  filing deadline for California, let's say just for argument's sake that Kevin McCarthy [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=153.54s)]
*  goes, you're at a 218 seat majority. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=159.34s)]
*  That's the smallest majority you could have in the House of Representatives. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=162.16s)]
*  Republicans for a year now have already really struggled with such a slim majority, one that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=166.74s)]
*  might shrink further, as you say. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2hQzJNWXCY&t=171.10000000000002s)]
