# Biden ends 50 years in public life
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY)
*  We're in it for the soul of America continues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=0.0s)]
*  In this moment of strength of our institutions and democracy, the presidency, the Congress, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  the courts, a free and independent press, and yes, our institutions and our communities [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=8.56s)]
*  like this museum, they matter more than ever. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=14.26s)]
*  That was President Biden speaking in Charleston, South Carolina yesterday, the last full day [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  of his presidency. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=23.06s)]
*  Joining us now, presidential historian and executive director of the George Washington [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=24.78s)]
*  presidential library, Lindsay Churwinski. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=28.34s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  Just talk a little bit about as you see President Biden there, a lot of conversation around [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=32.620000000000005s)]
*  his legacy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=37.7s)]
*  He tried to shape it in a speech last week. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=38.7s)]
*  What do you think the legacy will be, at least in the early part? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=41.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, a lot of presidents do try and shape their legacy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=44.58s)]
*  And unless they have a lengthy post presidential life like Carter, it's really hard to do. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=47.86s)]
*  So I think much of President Biden's legacy we don't know yet because we don't know how [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=52.7s)]
*  the legislation is actually going to pan out, whether or not some of the difficult decisions [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=57.62s)]
*  he made will have that impact. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=61.339999999999996s)]
*  We don't know how the foreign policy will shake out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=63.94s)]
*  And also so much of what comes next is going to shape how we think about him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=66.94s)]
*  So it's really just too soon to tell with how we think of him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=71.7s)]
*  And there's certainly been a lot of focus on what his life after the White House and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=75.22s)]
*  after his decades in public service are going to be. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=78.42s)]
*  One of the White House officials was on with us last week saying, you'll hear from him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=80.94s)]
*  Stay tuned, but still pretty vague. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=84.66s)]
*  And then, of course, there's what we're going to see later this morning. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=86.94000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump once again being sworn in. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=90.18s)]
*  I think the fact that he's going to be doing so indoors inside the very Capitol where his [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=92.62s)]
*  supporters ransacked it when he lost four years ago is a parallel we can't overstate [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=96.66000000000001s)]
*  this morning. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  But what are you thinking about as we head into this next phase of Donald Trump in the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=103.10000000000001s)]
*  White House? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's complicated because on one hand, I really admire and I believe in the upholding [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  these institutions and these precedents and norms and the celebration that does go along [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=113.94s)]
*  with the pomp and circumstance of this type of day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=119.46s)]
*  It's really important to the survival of the institution. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=122.66s)]
*  And yet, as you said, it would be odd to not acknowledge that the person who is coming [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=125.46s)]
*  into office was also the person that was involved in the only contested transition we've [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=130.1s)]
*  ever had. And I saw a comment the other day that his supporters won't need directions [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=134.98s)]
*  because they've already been into the Capitol. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=140.22s)]
*  And I think that's true. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=141.86s)]
*  And so it's very much a weird sort of bittersweet day. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=143.14s)]
*  And then there's the way that you see President Biden, the other former presidents all attending [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=147.14s)]
*  this inauguration, something that Trump did not do for Biden back in 2020. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=152.74s)]
*  How do you think history will remember that piece of Biden's legacy and the way that he [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=157.34s)]
*  really has sought to bring back the peaceful transition of power in a very public way? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=162.18s)]
*  Well, I think history will applaud the effort to bring back the peaceful transfer of power. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=168.74s)]
*  It is the bedrock of what it means to be a republic is that that's what we have. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=172.46s)]
*  If you have a different type of transition, it's a different type of government. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  And yet, as he just said in that in that speech that there's a war for the spirit of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  America and he was trying to save the soul of the nation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  And if the threat is that dire, then how do you make nice with the person who is that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  threat? And so I do think it is a complicated question. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=193.86s)]
*  It's a conversation that I've frankly had with sources since Biden or rather Kamala [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=196.34s)]
*  Harris lost the election to Donald Trump is how do you have an election that the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=201.02s)]
*  ending phase of was calling Donald Trump a fascist and then inviting him to the White [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  House to shake hands and talk about the job that he's coming into? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=210.38s)]
*  There is a real dissonance, I think, for people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  And so from a historical perspective, how would you explain it even now? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=216.86s)]
*  And I know it takes years to parse this stuff out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. On one hand, I think it's a reflection of the strength of these practices and the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  institutions that people feel the pressure to continue to uphold these norms, to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=228.54s)]
*  take pictures with the person coming in, to have them over for tea, to shake their hand. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=233.94s)]
*  And I think that that is good because that is what has allowed these institutions to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=238.98s)]
*  survive for as long as they have. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=243.34s)]
*  But on the other, I do think it causes people confusion because they are understandably [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=245.62s)]
*  confused about why you would say this person is a threat and then smile on a picture with [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  them. And so I do think people need to be a little bit more consistent about perhaps [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=255.7s)]
*  behavior while still upholding the norms and customs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  That consistency in behavior is certainly not a hallmark that we've come to expect from [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=263.5s)]
*  Trump in the White House or out. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=268.34s)]
*  But then there's also what we're physically going to watch today and see. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=270.58s)]
*  He's being inaugurated inside the Capitol that hasn't happened since Reagan's second [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=274.34s)]
*  inaugural. What are you expecting to see? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=278.5s)]
*  What are the parallels that we might see between this venerated Republican president and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=280.9s)]
*  Reagan and now Trump on his way back in? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=284.62s)]
*  Well, the thing I'm most interested to see is Reagan was known for his sunny optimism, for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=287.58s)]
*  proclaiming the United States as a shining city on a hill. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=291.58s)]
*  I would like to believe that that's what Trump will do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=295.58s)]
*  And I hope that it is. But I think that's that is definitely a question mark I have. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=297.7s)]
*  Yeah, certainly a lot of conversation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=301.82s)]
*  We were having it this morning, too, right in the segment before you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=303.98s)]
*  Will the tone of this be more American carnage? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=306.62s)]
*  He told our colleague, Kristen Welker, no, but we'll see ultimately when he gets up to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=309.78000000000003s)]
*  the podium. Lindsay Churwinski, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=314.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W44our9A4WY&t=316.65999999999997s)]
