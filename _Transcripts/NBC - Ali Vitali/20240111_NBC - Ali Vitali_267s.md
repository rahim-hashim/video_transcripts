# Biden takes the lead in Pennsylvania in general election polling
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44)
*  Welcome back. New polling shows that President Joe Biden has taken the lead over Donald Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=0.0s)]
*  in a hypothetical general election matchup in the key state of Pennsylvania. In the latest [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=5.24s)]
*  Quinnipiac University poll, Biden leads Trump by three points, 49% to 46% among registered [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=10.68s)]
*  voters in that state. Though let's be clear, that is within the survey's margin of error, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=17.04s)]
*  it does mark the first time a Quinnipiac poll has shown Biden ahead in Pennsylvania this [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=21.64s)]
*  election cycle. So there's some noteworthiness to that. Back in October, the same survey showed [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=27.42s)]
*  Trump leading Biden 47 to 45. When third party candidates are offered as ballot options as well, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=32.02s)]
*  the race gets even tighter with the new poll showing Biden's lead narrowing to just two points. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=38.38s)]
*  Joining us now, Bloomberg Politics editor Laura Davis. And Laura, let's start briefly with that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  poll. We're a long way to November, of course, but Pennsylvania might be the most important [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=49.42s)]
*  state on the map. It's certainly the one Biden spent the most time in. Senior aides acknowledged [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=55.06s)]
*  to me they don't really have a path to victory if they don't win it. So give us your impressions [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  of that poll and what it says about the race to 270. Yeah, this is a good sign for Joe Biden. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=64.3s)]
*  There's been a series of these polls looking specifically at swing states and Trump has been [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=70.5s)]
*  beating Biden poll after poll over the past several months. So if this becomes a trend, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=75.04s)]
*  this is a good sign for him. You know, Pennsylvania is personally important to the president. He's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  from Scranton. And so you've seen that play out in his campaign last week, giving a big [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=84.06s)]
*  democracy focused speech there. So this is going to be an area where he's very focused. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=88.54s)]
*  The thing that his campaign aides are surely very worried about is when you look at all those third [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=92.94s)]
*  party candidates in there, you have RFK Jr. picking up 11% support. That's not good. There's also [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=97.54s)]
*  signs that no labels is looking at fielding a candidate. Joe Manchin has been someone on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  their shortlist. He is both well known and popular in Pennsylvania. So this could become an issue for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=107.62s)]
*  him if there are more entrance into the race and Trump as well. It really blows open the whole race [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=112.42s)]
*  in some of these areas. If you have well known third party candidates who are picking up double [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=117.86s)]
*  digit support and just as a sign of Biden's commitment to Pennsylvania, he was just there [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  last week at Valley Forge. He's going again Friday. Allentown is going again next week. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=126.42s)]
*  He will be living in the Keystone state. They know how important that is. Laura, let's talk about [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=130.34s)]
*  Chris Christie. He dropped out of the race yesterday. He had suggested he had pledged he [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=135.14s)]
*  was going to make it all the way to New Hampshire. That turned out not to be the case. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=139.38s)]
*  No impact in Iowa. He wasn't playing there, but it could have one in New Hampshire. Give us your [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=142.5s)]
*  sense of how it could play out. Yeah. So if you're Chris Christie, you know, before giving his speech [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=147.06s)]
*  yesterday, a lot of people assumed he was going to endorse Nikki Haley. The timing of his departure [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  would seem to help her. You know, he's not really pulling very high in Iowa, as you mentioned, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=157.54s)]
*  but in New Hampshire, he's picking up significant support. Haley supporters and Christie supporters, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=161.38s)]
*  there's a certain amount of overlap there. So she would be naturally poised to pick up that support. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=165.46s)]
*  Of course, after that hot mic moment, it was clear, you know, what Christie's was really [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=170.34s)]
*  thinking in his head. But this, you know, is interesting for Haley because it does help her [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  ultimately. You know, she is still trailing Trump, you know, significantly, but New Hampshire is her [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=181.78s)]
*  strongest state and Donald Trump's weakest point on this early portion of the map. So if she's able [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=187.62s)]
*  to at least beat expectations in Iowa, not necessarily win, that could set her up in New [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=194.58s)]
*  Hampshire. But if she's there, particularly Christie, she has to deliver if she wants to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  continue that momentum in her campaign. And Laura, let's end by talking about Iowa just now a few days [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=202.74s)]
*  away. We're going to talk to Governor Sandusel later on morning. Joe, what are you hearing? What [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=207.54000000000002s)]
*  kind of number does he need to put up? What kind of showing does he need to have to be able to even [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=212.02s)]
*  just get through Iowa, a state where he's bet everything to even make it to New Hampshire and beyond? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  He needs to come in second and he needs to come in second well above Nikki Haley. So this is going [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=220.58s)]
*  to be very difficult for him. The polling has not been in his favor, though his campaign says his [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=225.46s)]
*  ground game is strong and they think they will overperform the polls. All right. Bloomberg [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=229.78s)]
*  Politics editor Laura Davidson. Thank you as always. I'm certain we'll be speaking to you [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  again soon. And thanks to all of you for getting up way too early with us on this very busy Thursday [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=238.18s)]
*  morning. A jam packed morning Joe starts right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMsRArho44&t=243.86s)]
