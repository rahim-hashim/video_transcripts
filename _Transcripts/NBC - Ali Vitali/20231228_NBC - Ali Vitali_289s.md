# House GOP seeks White House docs on Hunter Biden
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY)
*  The House Oversight and Judiciary Committees are seeking any communication between Hunter Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=0.0s)]
*  and the White House concerning his decision to defy a congressional subpoena earlier this month. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=5.2s)]
*  The move, which Oversight Chairman James Comer and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan admit [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=11.28s)]
*  is not based on any evidence that such this is all part of the GOP-led impeachment inquiry into [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  President Biden. The Chairman are seeking to determine whether the President was involved [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=23.68s)]
*  in his son's decision to not sit for a closed-door deposition to the Oversight Committee. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  The letter refers to a comment made by White House Press Secretary Corinne Jean-Pierre [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=35.68s)]
*  in which she asked whether the President spent time watching what his son said at that surprise [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=40.0s)]
*  press conference just outside the Capitol that day. Jean-Pierre answered by saying this, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  the President was certainly familiar with what his son was going to say. Senior White House [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=51.36s)]
*  officials had also confirmed to me the President had been given a heads up about what Hunter Biden [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=56.08s)]
*  was going to say but unclear whether he was involved in the decision-making process. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=60.64s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional Reporter for the New Republic, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Grace Segers. Grace, good to see you again. So this even in real time when the press secretary [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=68.08s)]
*  said that there was some who wondered if well that could become part of the GOP investigation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=74.56s)]
*  It has. But it does seem like this is more of a fishing expedition. They, they, and more of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=79.44s)]
*  same. There has yet to be a there there but that's simply not stopping Republicans. Tell us your [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=84.96s)]
*  latest reporting as to what they hope to achieve. I think what you're seeing here is that these [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=90.48s)]
*  Republican leaders of the impeachment inquiry are really just feeling a little bit frustrated [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=96.24s)]
*  that Hunter Biden did actually show up to the Capitol and gave a press conference. He just [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=101.44s)]
*  didn't come to their closed door deposition. Now his lawyer said multiple times that he would not [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=106.56s)]
*  go to the closed door deposition, that he wanted to do a public hearing and speak publicly. So [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=111.84s)]
*  everyone was surprised by Hunter Biden showing up and giving remarks to the press and it seems that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  is including the Republican shares of this inquiry. And now I think what you're seeing here is as you [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=126.56s)]
*  put it a bit of a fishing for a fishing expedition but it is motivated by the sense of frustration [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=132.8s)]
*  that yes he showed up just didn't show up for them. And so what you're seeing here is continuation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=139.36s)]
*  of that investigation that will likely include more requests to the White House but as we've seen [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=146.08s)]
*  in other arenas there is just no smoking gun here thus far when it comes to the president's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=154.08s)]
*  connection to his son's business dealings. We will see if there is a connection to his son's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=160.16s)]
*  decision to hold a press conference but even if there were I don't think it is necessarily the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=166.56s)]
*  stunning revelation that Republican chairs may think it is. Yeah hardly would seem to be grounds [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=173.6s)]
*  for impeachment let's say. So Grace give us your best sense of a timeline here as to how the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=178.96s)]
*  Republicans want to proceed on this impeachment inquiry and potentially impeachment itself. It is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  lost on no one that this is all going to come to a head in the early months of a election year. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  From what I've heard on the Hill Republicans would like to come to a decision about whether [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=198.08s)]
*  they are going to pursue impeachment by the end of January. I think a lot of more moderate [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=202.8s)]
*  Republicans Republicans in swing districts have been saying oh well an impeachment inquiry won't [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=210.88s)]
*  necessarily lead to impeachment itself. We have seen that is not generally the way it goes if you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=215.76s)]
*  have an impeachment inquiry is likely going to lead to an impeachment vote so I think that might [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  be a little bit of wishful thinking there but lest we forget Congress has a lot to do next month that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  includes funding the government preventing a partial government shutdown and also considering [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=232.72s)]
*  potential aid package with aid to Ukraine and Israel and oh lest we forget a potential change in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=238.72s)]
*  shift in immigration and border policy. So there is a lot happening in Congress that has nothing [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=247.84s)]
*  to do with impeachment and it'll be interesting to see if the Republican majority just in the house [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=253.6s)]
*  decides to prioritize impeachment over those other key agenda items. All right Grace Segers we [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=258.88s)]
*  appreciate it as always. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBR2JfkPSgY&t=267.44s)]
