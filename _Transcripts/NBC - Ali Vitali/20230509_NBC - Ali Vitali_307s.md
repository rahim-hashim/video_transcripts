# Biden to meet with party leaders over debt limit
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c)
*  There shouldn't be negotiations on the debt limit. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=0.0s)]
*  This is something that they should get to regular order and get to work on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=4.4s)]
*  We should not have House Republicans manufacturing a crisis on something that has been done 78 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  times since 1960. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=16.12s)]
*  Congress must avoid default without conditions, without conditions, as they did three times [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=17.96s)]
*  before in the last administration. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=22.72s)]
*  Democrats joined Republicans, put their politics aside, Democrats did, and made sure that they [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  made sure that that occurred, that happened. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=30.0s)]
*  So this is, the president is not going to change course here. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=32.04s)]
*  We've been very, very clear that they need to do, they need to do their job. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=37.8s)]
*  Welcome back to Way Too Early. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=43.24s)]
*  It's a little after 5 30 a.m. on the East Coast, 2 30 out West. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=44.6s)]
*  I'm Jonathan LaMere. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=48.6s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=49.6s)]
*  That was White House Press Secretary Corrine Jean-Pierre weighing in on the fight over [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=50.68s)]
*  the debt ceiling ahead of this afternoon's meeting between President Biden and top congressional [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=55.16s)]
*  leaders. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=60.44s)]
*  Joining us now, someone who's been covering this saga closely, White House reporter for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=61.44s)]
*  Bloomberg News, Josh Wingrove. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=64.44s)]
*  So Josh, great to see you. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=66.96s)]
*  The president has made clear, at least publicly, that he is going to stick to his vow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=69.28s)]
*  He's not going to negotiate about the debt ceiling. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=74.28s)]
*  He's saying these are two separate things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=76.52s)]
*  Debt ceiling here, budget spending cuts conversation over here, and that one's for later. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=78.72s)]
*  Is there any sign at all that that will change or that his Republicans on the other side [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=83.84s)]
*  might shift themselves? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=89.28s)]
*  There's a bit of a sign, John, and good morning. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  This has been a saga dating back, as we know, to January when Treasury began using these [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=94.16s)]
*  so-called extraordinary measures to avoid default. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=98.64s)]
*  Why did they start back then? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, we didn't know how tax season would go. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=103.84s)]
*  That's why this has sort of crept up, because revenues from tax season have been less than [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  some people forecast. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=110.1s)]
*  And now you've got Treasury Secretary yelling warning that the deadline could be as early [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=111.1s)]
*  as June 1st. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=115.94s)]
*  So everyone sort of has been dug in, expecting a battle that might have stretched till summer, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=117.1s)]
*  and may still stretch until summer, but now they're sort of trying to speed up in case [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  that's not the case. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Now they are drawing that distinction that you mentioned, and part of it is theoretical, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=131.14s)]
*  They think that the House speaker is more or less dangling the economy over a cliff [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=132.14s)]
*  to drop it if he doesn't get his way. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=137.42s)]
*  But at the same time, they're saying that, A, they're hosting him today, and B, Kareem [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  Jean-Pierre is saying yesterday they will have talks on the budget. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=144.77999999999997s)]
*  So there are small sort of shoots of movement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  Part of that, John, is because some of the leverage points that the administration has [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=150.88s)]
*  hoped for haven't materialized. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  You heard this from Michael earlier in the show, how, for instance, the Senate is not [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  going to be an off-ramp. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=160.22s)]
*  Mitch McConnell warning that they're not going to sort of ride in on their horse over the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=161.22s)]
*  hill to try to save things. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=165.08s)]
*  And there also hasn't been moderate House Republicans sort of dipping their toe in the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  water to put pressure on McCarthy or to signal that they might support a discharge petition [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  which would allow Democrats to go around the speaker. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=175.68s)]
*  So McCarthy's position has consolidated a bit in a way that the administration wasn't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  sure if that would be the case, and that's informing a lot of the sort of, you know, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=182.0s)]
*  groundwork going into this meeting. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=186.28s)]
*  So you just ticked off a few of the off-ramps the White House could have and probably now [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=188.08s)]
*  can't explore. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=192.36s)]
*  Also the president has mentioned recently, and others have as well, is the 14th Amendment [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=194.0s)]
*  invoking that to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=198.64s)]
*  Explain to viewers how that would work and is there any likelihood that he would use [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=200.92s)]
*  it? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=204.48s)]
*  Yeah, this is sort of one of those, in case of emergency, break glass options. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=205.48s)]
*  No one thinks this is an ideal option. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=209.74s)]
*  It would essentially be the president declaring that the debt ceiling, you know, is illegal, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=211.84s)]
*  doesn't matter, is unconstitutional. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  Also with other sort of extreme unilateral unproven legal theories. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=219.92s)]
*  John, we've talked before about minting the coin as an option that sort of, you know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=224.11999999999998s)]
*  tears up EEC on Twitter from here, from time to time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=227.76s)]
*  And so whether they do that, I think it's sort of a last resort option. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=231.44s)]
*  That is a case where Yellen says, you know, we're not going to make a Social Security [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  payment tomorrow. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=238.44s)]
*  This is absolute five alarm. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  Something needs to happen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=242.44s)]
*  It would immediately go to the courts. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=243.44s)]
*  But right now they're trying to get a deal before that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  You know, we have a fresh projection, I would note out this morning from the Bipartisan [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=248.52s)]
*  Policy Center, John. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  They're a think tank whose forecasts on this are watched super closely. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Their model was designed in part by Jay Powell, who of course is now the Fed chair. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=256.56s)]
*  And they're saying that the range of when the time might run out, it could be early [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=261.56s)]
*  June but also could be as late as July. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  So this one might drag on a little bit yet. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=268.8s)]
*  There's just no certainty about when the deadline will be. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=270.76s)]
*  Yeah, and one thing we do know for sure, a breakthrough unlikely this afternoon. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  Perhaps small progress can be made. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=277.6s)]
*  I know you have a long day ahead of you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=279.56s)]
*  We appreciate you starting with us. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=280.88s)]
*  White House reporter for Bloomberg News, Josh Wingrove. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=282.72s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=284.6s)]
*  We'll speak to you soon. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNAsE1VCU_c&t=285.6s)]
