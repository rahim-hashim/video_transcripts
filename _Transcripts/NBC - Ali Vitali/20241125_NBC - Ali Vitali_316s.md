# Trump plans to fire Jack Smith's team, use DOJ to probe 2020 election
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U)
*  President-elect Trump is planning to fire special prosecutor Jack Smith's entire team that pursued two prosecutions against him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=0.0s)]
*  The Washington Post is reporting the Trump's list includes career attorneys typically spared during presidential transitions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=6.84s)]
*  That's according to two individuals close to the transition team. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=13.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's pick for a new pick, Pam Bondi said this regarding firing career prosecutors at DOJ during an August 2023 appearance on Fox News. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=16.84s)]
*  The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones, the investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=30.08s)]
*  But now they have a spotlight on them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now with senior NBC News national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Good to see you again, John. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  So let's talk about this moves here, expected moves from Trump about DOJ firing a Smith's team and then this idea of even going after some of those in the department firing them. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=51.92s)]
*  There's been some chatter even trying to bring up some on charges. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=64.64s)]
*  What's the impact there in Washington? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=67.76s)]
*  I think the big impact is that it has a huge chilling effect on the Department of Justice and its willingness to investigate certainly President Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=69.8s)]
*  But more importantly, to investigate anybody who might be affiliated with them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=78.76s)]
*  Obviously, you know, as president, he has the ability to fire any political appointees who have not already resigned. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=84.16s)]
*  Certainly, there's also a potential chilling effect where you have civil servants who decide that rather than being fired, they want to resign. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=91.24s)]
*  So there are those chilling effects. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=98.56s)]
*  But basically, this, you know, feels like a big threat from Trump to the Justice Department, whether or not he is able to to affect all of the changes he might want to affect remains to be seen. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=100.72s)]
*  So, John, obviously, Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination last week when it was very clear that he was not going to get the votes needed, that even up to a dozen Republican senators might have come out against him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Pam Bondi, the new pick, what's the early take there? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=123.88s)]
*  The whip county, if you will, as to whether she'll be able to get through? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=127.16s)]
*  I mean, she's largely an establishment Republican for a career. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=130.84s)]
*  She just came out of a lobbying firm in Florida that's the same one that employed Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, incoming White House chief of staff, who has also long been seen as sort of an establishment Republican, worked in the Reagan administration, worked for mayors of Jacksonville, Florida. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=134.2s)]
*  So, you know, Bondi is somebody who had these establishment credentials in Florida and in Republican politics and over the last several years has, you know, has tilted toward MAGA, toward Trump, tried to prove her loyalty. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=151.64s)]
*  And as a result, you know, somebody, I guess, will have to see how she conducts herself in the Justice Department. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=167.72s)]
*  But I'd be shocked if she stands up to Trump in any significant way. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a fair bet, to be sure. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=177.2s)]
*  John, let's bring you in a conversation I was having earlier in the show with Michael Schnell of The Hill, the idea that now that Gates has withdrawn, Republican senators don't actually have to put their name to it, their opposition. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=179.32s)]
*  They don't have to stand up against them, potentially saving their fire for another Trump pick. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=191.04s)]
*  There's a belief that really they're only going to be able to defy him once or twice. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you read here? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Is it Peace Hegseth? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=202.04s)]
*  Is it Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=203.16s)]
*  Kennedy Jr.? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=204.56s)]
*  Or none of the above? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=205.56s)]
*  Do we think Republicans are going to defy Trump? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=206.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's limited. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=210.08s)]
*  Matt Gates is a special case. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=212.4s)]
*  None of those senators wanted to go back and defend the choice to vote for Matt Gates, and none of them wanted to have votes out there against Trump nominees. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=214.56s)]
*  Both of those possibilities were very politically painful for them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=224.12s)]
*  And the reason, obviously, because the allegations lodged against Gates that nobody wants to go home and defend them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=229.84s)]
*  You know, I think it's possible that they do the same kind of thing with one or two more of these nominees. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=235.12s)]
*  You know, Gabbard seems to have upset some people in the Senate. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=242.6s)]
*  You've got Hegseth, you know, has had allegations against him, you know, for sexual misconduct, denies them, obviously not been proven. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=246.44s)]
*  And at the same time, you know, there are Republican women senators in particular who have been, you know, pretty tough on that issue. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  Joni Ernst from Iowa, of course, comes to mind immediately. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=264.2s)]
*  So we'll have to see what happens with these nominees. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=267.24s)]
*  But I wouldn't I wouldn't put a number on it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=269.24s)]
*  I would hesitate to say, well, Gates is gone, so that's it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=271.12s)]
*  Or there's only one more they can get. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=274.28s)]
*  They have learned the lesson that if they stick together behind the scenes, they don't have to vote on the floor. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, more of Trump's picks during that blitz of announcements on Friday. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=281.2s)]
*  More conventional, perhaps some of the health choices raising eyebrows. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  But those are the ones we mentioned here who could come into real scrutiny now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=287.72s)]
*  Senior NBC News national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you as always. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phudB5Rg94U&t=293.88s)]
