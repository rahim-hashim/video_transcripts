# UAW goes on strike against Big 3 automakers
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s)
*  We'll begin this morning with tens of thousands of United auto workers hitting the picket lines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=0.0s)]
*  The union officially went on strike against Detroit's big three automakers at midnight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=5.0s)]
*  Nearly 13,000 members walked out of three plants in Missouri, Ohio, and in Michigan. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=11.0s)]
*  The strike is against General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=18.0s)]
*  The union and the companies failed to reach a deal on a new collective bargaining agreement [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=22.0s)]
*  before the current contract expired at the stroke of 12. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=26.0s)]
*  Tonight, for the first time in our history, we will strike all three of the big three at once. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=31.0s)]
*  We are using a new strategy, the stand-up strike. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=40.0s)]
*  We will call on select facilities, locals, or units to stand up and go on strike. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=45.0s)]
*  This strategy will keep the companies guessing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=52.0s)]
*  It will give our national negotiators maximum leverage and flexibility in bargaining. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=55.0s)]
*  And if we need to go all out, we will. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=61.0s)]
*  Everything is on the table. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=65.0s)]
*  The union is demanding a 40% pay raise over the next four years, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=67.0s)]
*  noting that the compensation packages for the big three's chief executives [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=73.0s)]
*  have increased about that much amid near-record earnings. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=77.0s)]
*  The automakers are condemning the strike. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=81.0s)]
*  Overnight, GM released a statement stating that before the walk-up began, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=84.0s)]
*  it offered, quote, historic wage increases and an unprecedented economic package. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=88.0s)]
*  Ford says the union's latest counterproposal shows little movements from their original demands, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=94.0s)]
*  adding that their requests would hurt the companies and give a boost to non-union rivals [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=101.0s)]
*  such as Tesla and Toyota. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=107.0s)]
*  We will have much more on this story as the morning goes on. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IomeU79oA6s&t=109.0s)]
