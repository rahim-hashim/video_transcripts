# VP Harris defends Biden, blasts special counsel report
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris came out with a forceful response to special counsel Robert [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=0.0s)]
*  Herr's report on his investigation into President Biden's handling of classified documents. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=4.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  The way that the president's demeanor in that report was characterized, characterized, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=12.08s)]
*  be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=18.64s)]
*  And so I will say that when it comes to the role and responsibility of a prosecutor in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  a situation like that, we should expect that there would be a higher level of integrity [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  than what we saw. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=42.04s)]
*  The vice president made those comments Friday during a gun violence prevention event at [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=44.2s)]
*  the White House. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=48.56s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, our friend Ken Thomas. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=49.56s)]
*  Ken, there was a lot of Democrats who felt that President Biden's news conference Thursday [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=54.6s)]
*  night in the wake of the report, not very effective. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=58.36s)]
*  They thought the vice president did well there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=61.0s)]
*  You've got a new piece in The Wall Street Journal reporting more about the reaction [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=64.28s)]
*  inside the West Wing to Robert Herr's report. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=68.48s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=72.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think, Jonathan, there was just a lot of frustration within the White House [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=73.12s)]
*  right now over the characterization of that, those interviews that the president conducted. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=77.44s)]
*  We also heard from some people who formerly advised the president who said that they really [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  shouldn't have had him sit down for that interview so soon after the October 7th attacks in Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=89.04s)]
*  So I think, you know, right now there's a lot of frustration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=98.04s)]
*  You see the vice president went out on Friday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=100.22s)]
*  We were told that there was some interest in having her do a Sunday show, but she insisted [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=103.4s)]
*  that she needed to get out and defend the president. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=109.06s)]
*  That's why you saw her forcefully coming out as a former California attorney general, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=112.36s)]
*  former prosecutor, and saying that this is a politically motivated process and investigation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=117.28s)]
*  And so this is one of those cases where the vice president is really there to back up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=124.56s)]
*  the president, to vouch for him, and her legal background I think helped in this case. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=129.6s)]
*  Some strategists I talked to in recent days think two things could be true at once, that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=134.24s)]
*  yes, the report was gratuitous, the focus should have been the president didn't commit [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  any wrongdoing with those documents, that the remarks about his memory didn't seem necessary. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=141.56s)]
*  At the same time, it does underscore belief that's out there in the public. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=145.96s)]
*  We know voters. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=149.44s)]
*  There's another wave of polling over the weekend. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=150.44s)]
*  The majority of Americans think President Biden is simply too old to run again. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  How does the White House combat that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=156.76s)]
*  Again, it's just one of those difficult things where he was more or less exonerated on the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=158.6s)]
*  legal side, but kneecapped politically. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=164.8s)]
*  And I think, you know, we saw Bob Bauer say over the weekend that, you know, they tried [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=167.88s)]
*  to push to get those characterizations out of the report. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=172.4s)]
*  They argued that it was prejudicial. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=176.66s)]
*  You know, usually the norms with the Justice Department is that you don't put out prejudicial [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=178.56s)]
*  information about someone who's not being charged. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=183.6s)]
*  But this is one of those cases where it's going to be rough politically for the president [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=187.28s)]
*  to push back against these things because there's just this perception out there that's [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=191.96s)]
*  widely viewed among the public that he's slowed down, that he doesn't have the mental [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=196.7s)]
*  capacity to be president. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  And so I think really at this point, the White House is just trying to move forward, get [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  him out there, have him do events that pushes back against that sentiment. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=211.06s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=216.42s)]
*  We saw them be aggressive in recent days. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=217.42s)]
*  They joined TikTok, the campaign did last night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=220.7s)]
*  That's sort of an amusing ad, also really focusing on Donald Trump's comments about [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=223.38s)]
*  NATO. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=227.22s)]
*  White House reporter for The Wall Street Journal, Ken Thomas, thank you as always for joining [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=228.22s)]
*  us this morning. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=231.98s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=232.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLLkmW5Ymqg&t=253.14s)]
