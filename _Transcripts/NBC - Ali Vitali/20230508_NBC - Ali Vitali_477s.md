# Biden defends son as DOJ weighs criminal charges
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw)
*  President Joe Biden is defending his son Hunter as the Justice Department reportedly nears [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=0.0s)]
*  a decision on whether or not to charge him criminally. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=5.72s)]
*  Speaking with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhl on Friday, the president weighed in on reports that federal [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=9.44s)]
*  prosecutors will soon announce the outcome of a multiple-year investigation into his [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=14.96s)]
*  youngest son. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=19.8s)]
*  Sources tell NBC News the DOJ is considering a felony count of tax evasion, a gun-related [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  charge which could rise to a felony, and two misdemeanor counts for failure to file taxes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=27.2s)]
*  Sir, there is something personal that's affecting you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=33.44s)]
*  Your son, while there's no ties to you, could be charged by your Department of Justice. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=37.36s)]
*  How will that impact your presidency? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=41.84s)]
*  First of all, my son's done nothing wrong. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=44.16s)]
*  I trust him. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  I have faith in him. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  And it impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=49.32s)]
*  Hunter Biden has denied any wrongdoing in the tax case, saying he handled the matter [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=54.44s)]
*  quote legally and appropriately. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=58.58s)]
*  Two weeks after he officially announced his reelection bid, the polling shows the president's [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=62.04s)]
*  approval rating has hit a new low. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=66.36s)]
*  In the latest Washington Post ABC News survey out yesterday, just 37% of registered voters [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=69.32s)]
*  say they approve of the president's job performance, his lowest figure for that poll since returning [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=76.0s)]
*  to office. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=81.26s)]
*  But there are also troubling numbers for Biden's most likely opponent in the 2024 general election. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=83.2s)]
*  At the moment, that's Donald Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  In the survey, more than half of all voters say that Trump should face criminal charges [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, his role in the January 6th insurrection, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  and for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=100.86000000000001s)]
*  Despite this, the new poll shows that Trump leads Biden by six points in a possible 2020 [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  rematch, 45% to 39%. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=111.74s)]
*  Joining us now, NBC News senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=115.98s)]
*  Jon, great to see you this morning. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=120.54s)]
*  Let's start with that poll. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  Definitely raised eyebrows across the political landscape when it dropped yesterday, not just [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=125.3s)]
*  because this is the lowest the president's approval rating has been in quite some time, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=130.1s)]
*  but for the first time in a while, he's down and down outside of the margin of error to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=133.58s)]
*  Donald Trump in a possible rematch. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=137.86s)]
*  What's your analysis? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=139.66s)]
*  I think that's exactly right, Jonathan. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=140.82s)]
*  We're not talking about a point or two. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=144.1s)]
*  We are not talking about a Biden lead of a point or two. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=147.22s)]
*  We are not talking about a Trump-aligned polling firm. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=150.54s)]
*  This is ABC and Washington Post, two news outlets with great respect around the country. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=154.14s)]
*  You've got this kind of huge number here, at least for modern politics, with Trump at [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=164.38000000000002s)]
*  45 to Biden's 39. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=168.5s)]
*  I think if you look at the possible matchup against DeSantis for Biden, the spread is basically [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  the same. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=178.3s)]
*  DeSantis at 44 and Biden at 38. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=179.3s)]
*  I think it's not exactly the crisis moment for Democrats, but I think this is troublesome [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=182.86s)]
*  for them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=189.82000000000002s)]
*  I think it probably has something to do with President Biden getting back in as a candidate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=191.62s)]
*  I think politicians are always better viewed when they are not officially candidates for [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=195.66s)]
*  office. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=202.26s)]
*  So it seems to me, some Democrats have been telling me for a while now, they are nervous [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=203.26s)]
*  about enthusiasm for the president, as you started to just hint at right there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=206.5s)]
*  Also, they didn't release their fundraising numbers after their launch, which campaigns [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=210.34s)]
*  tend to do if those numbers are good. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=214.22s)]
*  So we didn't hear it from the president. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=217.06s)]
*  So, you know, so many Democrats in polls say that, hey, President Biden's done a good job, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  but they're not sure they want him to run again. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=223.3s)]
*  But it would seem to be the theory of the case would be they come out to vote against [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=225.82s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  Does this poll suggest that that's a bit of maybe Democrats a little overconfident in [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=234.02s)]
*  I think certainly Democrats are overconfident if they think that that is a certainty. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=235.02s)]
*  If you look inside these numbers, you know, usually what the biggest issue is for voters [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=239.52s)]
*  in almost every election is the economy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=244.18s)]
*  If you look inside those numbers and you've got 53 percent saying Trump did a better job [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=247.66s)]
*  handling the economy, 38 percent saying Biden, you know, that's got to be something that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=252.1s)]
*  Democrats are very worried about. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=257.74s)]
*  You know, I think this is a point where the Democrats have to reflect a little bit on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  where they're headed and what it is they can do to change a trajectory that, you know, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=264.06s)]
*  that at the very best looks like an extraordinarily close election, a la the 2020 election. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=269.94s)]
*  Yeah, at least to this point, as you and others have reported, the Trump campaign, pretty [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=277.26s)]
*  organized, pretty effective, at least at this moment in the early goings. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=281.29999999999995s)]
*  John, let's talk about Hunter Biden for a moment. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=284.78s)]
*  I have somebody reporting out as well. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  The White House preparing for the possible decision whether he will be charged criminally [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=289.02s)]
*  or not. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=293.9s)]
*  That's probably coming next few weeks or months. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=294.9s)]
*  There's no war room at the White House. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  This is, you know, so many Biden aides feel like this was litigated in 2020 and voters [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=299.26s)]
*  were willing to vote for the president then. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=304.78s)]
*  But it does seem the Democrats I speak to say, well, this isn't going to be great for [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=307.14s)]
*  them either way, that on one hand, if Hunter Biden is charged, that's the son of the president [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  of the United States being charged criminally. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=315.02s)]
*  If he's not, that's going to give Republicans fodder to say that DOJ was biased, the fix [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  was in. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=320.86s)]
*  And even though Donald Trump himself, we should point out, is facing indictment, this could [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=321.86s)]
*  be a legitimate distraction. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=326.41999999999996s)]
*  What are people you're talking to saying? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=328.02s)]
*  Well, John, I think that reporting is dead on. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=329.58s)]
*  We've seen it not just with this Hunter Biden case, but we've seen it in recent years, as [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=333.26000000000005s)]
*  you point out, with Donald Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=337.82000000000005s)]
*  You saw it with Donald Trump asking the Ukrainians to announce an investigation into Joe and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=339.74s)]
*  Hunter Biden, this idea that if somebody is under investigation, it's basically a no-win [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=345.86s)]
*  situation for them, you know, I think has become at least a leitmotif in our politics, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=351.26000000000005s)]
*  if not the major theme of our politics. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  So whatever happens with Hunter Biden, it will be outraged, certainly for Republicans. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=361.3s)]
*  But I do think that there is some set of voters in the country, some independents, perhaps [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=366.7s)]
*  those very people that think Donald Trump should face charges, but also might vote for [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=371.86s)]
*  him, who look at convictions, who look at official charges as things that are bad and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=376.46s)]
*  reasons not to support candidates. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=383.48s)]
*  Yeah, and I do think there are some Democrats, though, who think that Hunter Biden's challenge [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=387.86s)]
*  with addiction, he's been very open about that, and the president's love for him actually [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=391.74s)]
*  gains sympathy from some voters as well. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=395.46s)]
*  John, one last quick one. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  We're expecting in the next couple of weeks Governor DeSantis of Florida to finally announce [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=398.46s)]
*  that he is indeed running. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=402.18s)]
*  His fledgling campaign to this point has struggled, to say the least. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=403.94s)]
*  Is there a sense among Republicans, though, that he could turn it around? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=408.98s)]
*  I think there are a lot of Republicans that are praying that he turns it around. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=412.9s)]
*  John, there's a significant portion of the party that, like anybody other than Donald [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=415.7s)]
*  Trump, what does not appear to be the case at this moment is that that segment is larger [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=419.18s)]
*  than the base that Donald Trump has going into the primary. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=424.54s)]
*  So the question is going to be, what can Ron DeSantis do to change hearts and minds and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  votes among the set of Republicans that are not already committed to Trump? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=433.68s)]
*  So far, the bar is low for him at this point. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=438.22s)]
*  He's got an opportunity, but it's low because he hasn't performed well. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, to say the least. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=447.74s)]
*  NBC News senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen, always a pleasure. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=449.9s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=453.26s)]
*  We will speak to you again soon. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=454.38s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgU9N_x1omw&t=455.65999999999997s)]
