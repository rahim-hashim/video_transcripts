# GOP 2024 presidential candidates weigh Trump strategy
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw)
*  Despite the serious new allegations against former President Donald Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=0.0s)]
*  new polling shows that Republican voters are more concerned about that indictment [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=5.0s)]
*  being politically motivated than his actions potentially being a national [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  security risk. In the latest CBS News YouGov survey, when asked which of the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=13.92s)]
*  two concerns, 76% of likely GOP primary voters say they're more [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=19.0s)]
*  worried about the indictment being politically motivated. Just 12% say [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=25.16s)]
*  they're more concerned about the possible national security implications. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=29.4s)]
*  Furthermore, if it is proven that Trump took classified documents containing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  military or nuclear secrets, only 38% of likely Republican voters say that would [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=38.96s)]
*  be a national security risk. Among the rest of the country, that number is up to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=44.56s)]
*  80%. And overall, 61% of likely Republican voters say the new [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=49.2s)]
*  charges will not change their view of Trump. Joining us now, communications [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=55.28s)]
*  strategist and former aide to House speakers Ryan and Boehner, Brandon Buck. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  He is now an MSNBC political analyst. Brandon, great to see you. Let's just [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=65.28s)]
*  start right there. What's your reaction to all of that polling? Yeah, it's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=69.4s)]
*  remarkable, but it also shouldn't be surprising. I mean, there have been years [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=73.76s)]
*  and years of groundwork laid by Donald Trump to make the case that the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=77.6s)]
*  Department of Justice and the FBI are corrupt. They're out to get him. You know, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=81.76s)]
*  all of the deep state deep state stuff we always talk about. And it's also [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  important to appreciate that a lot of Republican voters get a lot of this [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=89.0s)]
*  information very differently. Whether it's certain networks they watch or [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=92.48s)]
*  whatever it may be, there is a very deeply held sense that there are forces [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  in Washington who are out to get Donald Trump. This polling like that doesn't [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  just happen by accident. It doesn't just happen based on what just happened. It's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=104.68s)]
*  been years. So that's what makes it so hard to hold him accountable. And that's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=107.44s)]
*  what makes it so hard for some of his the folks running against him in this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=111.96s)]
*  primary to navigate and how to actually take advantage of this situation. Yeah, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=115.92s)]
*  it's a it's a great point, Brandon, just like he did with the false claims of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=119.72s)]
*  election interference, of a rigged election. He planted the seeds of the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=123.56s)]
*  big lie years in advance, and here he's been chipping away at the Americans [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=126.72s)]
*  faith in their institutions, including the DOJ for many years as well. So you [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=130.4s)]
*  just mentioned that 2024 Republican primary candidates, how do they approach [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=134.44s)]
*  this? And are they playing to win? Yeah, I'm actually really curious, starting to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=138.12s)]
*  question that for several of them. Look, if your goal through all of this is to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=143.4s)]
*  preserve your standing with Republican voters, I get it like it's actually a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=149.24s)]
*  slam dunk. Do what do what a lot of them are doing, which is explain it away. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=153.98s)]
*  Talk about Joe Biden. Talk about Hillary Clinton. That is definitely the safe [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=157.92s)]
*  place to be if your goal is to be in good standing with Republican voters [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=161.96s)]
*  right now. But if your goal is to defeat Donald Trump in this race, I just simply [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=166.68s)]
*  don't understand it. I mean, this is one of the biggest moments that's going to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=172.16s)]
*  happen in this entire primary. And you have so many of them who are running [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=175.08s)]
*  basically running interference, providing excuses, trying to downplay it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=179.08s)]
*  I simply don't understand why you're running. Your goal is to defeat him. You [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  would think you'd have to take him on. And I and I just encourage some of these [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=187.28s)]
*  candidates to think, what would Donald Trump do in this situation? I can't [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=190.32s)]
*  imagine that he would make excuses for his candidates. He would make them [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  answer for it. So I understand why some of them don't want to do it. But if [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=197.76s)]
*  that's really your goal to stay in good standing, you probably shouldn't be in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=201.84s)]
*  this race in the first place, especially by staying in the race. You dilute the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=204.9s)]
*  field and make it easier for Trump, who, of course, has that base of support. We [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  should note that some of these candidates have already pledged to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  pardon Trump for he to be convicted and they to be elected. So do you think [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=214.12s)]
*  there's any chance this could change? I mean, Tuesday is going to be a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=219.98s)]
*  significant moment in American political history. A former president in a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=222.38s)]
*  courtroom facing federal charges. Could that image potentially change things [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=226.26s)]
*  for a pence or a dissent us or one of these other candidates? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  I think there is a chance that over the over time, there can become a question [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=234.78s)]
*  of whether this is actually a person who can get elected. And I think there are [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=238.78s)]
*  real questions about that. And I try not to put too much give too much credit to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=242.01999999999998s)]
*  either Republican or Democratic voters really on the question of electability. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=247.42s)]
*  But it's a real issue. But it will only be a real issue if some of his opponents [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=251.46s)]
*  make people confront that question. If you talk about it, if you say, is this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=255.94s)]
*  the type of person who could actually defeat Donald Trump? One of the problems [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=259.82s)]
*  that Ron DeSantis, for example, has had who's tried to make that argument, I [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=263.22s)]
*  think, is that there are plenty of polls that show Donald Trump within striking [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=266.86s)]
*  distance or even beating Joe Biden in a hypothetical matchup. So you really need [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=270.04s)]
*  to chip away at that. If your goal is to say, I'm more electable than Donald [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=273.84s)]
*  Trump, here's a great opportunity to say this may not be a person who's going to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  get elected if he's potentially facing jail time. But so many base Republican [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=280.91999999999996s)]
*  voters never hear that conversation. That's why it's really incumbent upon his [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=285.44s)]
*  opponents, I think, to bring that up and force the question. Yeah, the dissent [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=288.84s)]
*  us campaign is sort of whispered to allies and reporters alike saying, Hey, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=292.52s)]
*  we think that these indict this criminal investigations could help take Trump [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=296.76s)]
*  down. And they haven't moved on it yet. Two entitlements already. There could be [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=300.24s)]
*  more. We'll have to see if the GOP primary field changes tactics. Brandon [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  Buck, thank you so much for joining us this morning. And thanks to all of you [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  for getting up way too early with us on this Monday morning. Big week ahead. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27KYfApR8yw&t=312.44s)]
