# President Biden to mark one year since Uvalde shooting
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ)
*  This afternoon, President Joe Biden will mark one year since the massacre in Uvalde, Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House says the president will give a speech remembering the victims, the young [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=8.2s)]
*  victims, and quote, reiterate his call for Republicans in Congress to act and help stop [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  the epidemic of gun violence that has become the number one killer of kids in America. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Last year, 19 fourth grade students and two teachers were killed by an 18-year-old gunman [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=25.08s)]
*  inside Robb Elementary there in Uvalde. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=31.08s)]
*  Seventeen others were seriously injured. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=34.2s)]
*  Hundreds of local and state police officers waited outside the school for more than an [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=37.44s)]
*  hour before breaching the classroom and finally killing the gunman. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=41.64s)]
*  The shooter legally bought both of the AR-style rifles he had with him just days before the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=46.16s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  Joining us now, Chris Brown, president of Brady, the advocacy campaign that focuses [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=54.64s)]
*  on preventing gun violence. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=59.12s)]
*  Chris, thanks for being here in Uvalde. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  One of the darkest days in our nation's history right there with Sandy Hook. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  In the years since, we have only seen more mass shootings, including quite a few there [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=66.96s)]
*  in the state of Texas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=71.8s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=73.28s)]
*  How has Texas responded in the last year about mass shootings? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=74.44s)]
*  Are there any sense that some gun legislation could be in the offering? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=78.66s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Jonathan. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  Indeed, it's a terrible day today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=85.44s)]
*  Just thinking back a year ago, near the end of school for these fourth graders and the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  families and the devastation of that community won't go away. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  And I'm sad to report that Texas's response to this through Governor Abbott and those [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=99.12s)]
*  beholden to an insurrectionist view of the Second Amendment has been to further weaken [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=104.64s)]
*  Texas law. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=110.48s)]
*  Texas was already a state when this happened that had among the worst gun laws in this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=112.0s)]
*  country. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  And only recently, Texas passed a permitless carry law, effectively allowing individuals [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  in Texas to carry long guns anywhere for any reason. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=123.96s)]
*  We already have debunked the myth, quite frankly, that the only thing that stops a bad [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=128.56s)]
*  guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=134.28s)]
*  Of course, that perpetrated by the NRA. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=136.4s)]
*  The permitless carry bill builds on the abysmal record of Texas, which does not have universal [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=139.32s)]
*  background checks, gun owner licensing, extreme risk laws, most domestic violence laws, assault [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=147.28s)]
*  weapons restrictions, a large capacity magazine restriction. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=154.84s)]
*  The list goes on and that's a real problem. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=159.32s)]
*  So I do hope that finally, legislators in Texas listen to the outcries of so many Texans [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=163.04s)]
*  who want these lifesaving changes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  We have seen gun laws weaken and other states across the nation as well. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=173.0s)]
*  On the federal level, President Biden will again push for more restrictions today, but [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=176.72s)]
*  there is seemingly no appetite for that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  Yes, there was bipartisan legislation passed last year, some modest gun safety measures, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  but it seems like this Republican Congress doesn't want to touch it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  But let's talk about some political wins, though. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=191.96s)]
*  It does seem polling suggests that more and more Americans do want some sort of added [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=194.12s)]
*  gun safety legislation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=200.32s)]
*  What are you guys pushing forward? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=201.56s)]
*  What kind of moment do you think we're in? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=202.84s)]
*  We're pushing for a comprehensive approach to what is now our number one killer of kids, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=206.0s)]
*  a uniquely American epidemic. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=212.16s)]
*  We want every state to have universal background checks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  It just stands for the simple proposition that whenever a firearm is purchased, if you're [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=217.84s)]
*  a prohibited purchaser, a convicted domestic felon, convicted domestic abuser, that there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=223.52s)]
*  is a background check conducted. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=230.12s)]
*  We've now gotten that in half of states, but we have a patchwork in states like Texas. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=231.8s)]
*  They don't have that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  You can go on the Internet and even be a convicted felon and buy a firearm in the state of Texas. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=237.84s)]
*  That needs to change. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=244.12s)]
*  We'd like it to happen at the federal level. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=245.56s)]
*  In the absence of that, we will continue the march state by state. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=248.24s)]
*  We also want more extreme risk laws. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=251.96s)]
*  Those are the laws that allow the removal of a firearm from someone deemed at risk by [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=254.44s)]
*  a court of law. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=259.72s)]
*  Nineteen states in the District of Columbia have that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=261.04s)]
*  We want to expand it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  Finally, the main other priority at the state level, Jonathan, and the federal government [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=265.44s)]
*  can support this, is better permitting systems. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=269.56s)]
*  States like Texas and Florida have moved the wrong way. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=273.56s)]
*  Those permitting systems, combined with expanded Brady background checks, research shows those [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  states that have those laws have reduced gun death and injury. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  And right now, of course, our thoughts are with those in Navalde, Texas, and those parents [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  who had to bury their children, their little kids, after that shooting one year ago today. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=293.92s)]
*  President of Brady, Chris Brown, thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=298.6s)]
*  We really appreciate you being on this morning. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHXGEEJh9oQ&t=300.84000000000003s)]
