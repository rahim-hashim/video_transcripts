# Zelenskyy to travel to Japan for G7 summit
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g)
*  Back with the G7 summit in Japan now fully underway the war in Ukraine is a real focus [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=0.0s)]
*  of the gathering. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=6.82s)]
*  The Financial Times reports that the group of seven leaders, the world's wealthiest democracies, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=8.0s)]
*  are gearing up to impose new sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  specifically targeting export controls and Russia's ability to sell and ship diamonds, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=19.2s)]
*  which is one of the few remaining industries in Russia that has not been dramatically affected [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=25.12s)]
*  by Western sanctions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=29.4s)]
*  Also developing in the last few hours the news that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=31.52s)]
*  will attend in person the final day of the G7 summit, that would be on Sunday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  No further details have been publicly shared due to the obvious security concerns. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=42.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's new reporting out that due to an accounting error, the United States [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=47.12s)]
*  thought it had sent more weapons to Ukraine than it really had, meaning three billion [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=52.8s)]
*  more dollars in funding has been freed up to go toward the defense of the war-torn nation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=59.48s)]
*  Pentagon just found that extra three billion dollars. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=65.2s)]
*  The Times reports that the mistake was cut months ago, but the Pentagon and State Department [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=67.56s)]
*  didn't inform congressional staffers until yesterday. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=71.64s)]
*  Joining us now live from the G7 in Hiroshima, Japan, Washington correspondent for Bloomberg [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=76.08s)]
*  Henry Horton, who is one of the reporters who broke the news about Zelensky's upcoming [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=81.92s)]
*  trip to Japan. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=86.36s)]
*  Henry, great to see you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=87.36s)]
*  Tell us how this trip came together and what do we think we'll hear from Zelensky when [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=89.56s)]
*  he reaches the G7? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=93.24s)]
*  Well, a lot of cloak and daggers obviously around President Volodymyr Zelensky's travels, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=94.24s)]
*  Jonathan. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=100.08s)]
*  There's also another wrinkle to this that me and my colleague Jenny Leonard reported, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=101.08s)]
*  which is that before he comes here to Hiroshima to address G7 leaders, President Biden and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=104.12s)]
*  others, he's actually also stopping in Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  There is an Arab League summit today, so he will be addressing those individuals. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  That is going to be one to watch because Assad from Syria will also be there for the first [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=115.72s)]
*  time in 13 years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=121.84s)]
*  And of course, you know, Russia's military has propped up his entire government. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  But then he's going to come here to Hiroshima. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  And the message he's going to be bringing is one that he's been bringing to European [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=129.16s)]
*  capitals over the past few weeks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=132.88s)]
*  And this is about more aid and ammunition as Ukraine is preparing for this counteroffensive [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=135.8s)]
*  to really try to gain control that Russia has during the past year and a half of this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=141.28s)]
*  war. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=148.08s)]
*  So, Anne-Marie, we just mentioned the G7 leaders are looking to impose some new sanctions against [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=149.08s)]
*  Russia. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=154.52s)]
*  Give us the analysis there of what they could really mean. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=155.52s)]
*  Is there a sense that these go far enough that it might finally start to have an impact [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=157.84s)]
*  on certain sectors of the Russian economy? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=161.84s)]
*  So there's been a barrage of sanctions across the entire Russian economy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=165.08s)]
*  And I think what you see now from leaders is they're really trying to manipulate it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=169.08s)]
*  to make sure that those sanctions are being used to the harshest degree. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=173.12s)]
*  It's about closing the loopholes, going to third party countries that potentially Russia [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  is still leaning on to import things in the industrial industry, that things that they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=181.4s)]
*  can use as they continue to wage this war. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=186.0s)]
*  So I think it's really about closing those loopholes, making sure things like the price [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=189.12s)]
*  cap are still being diligently used in the marketplace so that Russian oil is still hitting [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=192.08s)]
*  the global market, but they are not reaping the highest benefits and the profits. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=198.16s)]
*  The other addition we are hearing is that they will also start to track and trace the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=202.44s)]
*  lucrative diamond trade that comes from Moscow. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=207.48s)]
*  But Jonathan, they are not going as hard as potentially some would like. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=210.28s)]
*  The United Kingdom is flat out banning it, but they're out of the European Union. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=214.96s)]
*  The G7 is coming out saying they're going to track and trace this, but they are not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=219.24s)]
*  slapping all out sanctions when it comes to the diamond trade. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=223.24s)]
*  This is particularly difficult for some European countries like Belgium, and they say that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=227.52s)]
*  that trade will just go elsewhere. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=231.76s)]
*  But you do see more incremental steps from the G7 to really try to continue the onslaught [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=233.5s)]
*  of sanctions on the Russian economy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=239.46s)]
*  And Anne-Marie, lastly and briefly, of course, President Biden has cut short his trip to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=241.12s)]
*  Asia, you know, the fight over the debt ceiling back here at home is overshadowed, his presence [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=246.72s)]
*  there in Japan. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  But what do we expect to hear from him for the rest of the weekend summit? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  So this morning he had a call with his legislative staff, that group that is really working with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=256.91999999999996s)]
*  Republicans to try to hammer out the agreement on the debt ceiling. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=261.28s)]
*  He's going to constantly be asked about this, Jonathan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=266.44s)]
*  He really does feel like he has one ear in Hiroshima and one ear back in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=268.64s)]
*  The mute music is pointing to potentially things are getting better in terms of striking [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=274.24s)]
*  a deal. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=278.94s)]
*  Speaker McCarthy said maybe this weekend we could see a deal in principle. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=279.94s)]
*  But all of this, obviously, we have to caveat with the fact that there is no agreement just [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=284.16s)]
*  yet. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=288.14s)]
*  Patrick McHenry, chair of the Financial Services Committee, a key ally of McCarthy, saying [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=289.14s)]
*  that there is not an agreement yet. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  But the mute music is starting to change. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=295.44s)]
*  And I think for the president, that is really important. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=297.16s)]
*  He wants to make sure, one, that while he is here meeting with global leaders, he's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=300.16s)]
*  still keeping an eye on potentially the biggest risk to not just the U.S. economy, but the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=304.16s)]
*  global economy while it's on the ground here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  And of course, two, he wants to make sure that he is bringing that message to these [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=311.16s)]
*  leaders who are quite concerned about what a default would mean for their own economies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=314.24s)]
*  Because of course, you know, treasuries are the underlying bedrock of the global financial [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  system. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=325.56s)]
*  Christian Correspondent for Bloomberg TV, terrific reporting this morning from Anne-Marie [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=327.6s)]
*  Horton, Travel Safe. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIf7wD-Tg3g&t=331.20000000000005s)]
