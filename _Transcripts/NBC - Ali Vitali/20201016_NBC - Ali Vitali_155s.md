# Sen. Sasse Criticizes Trump During Call With Constituents | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos)
*  Meanwhile, in a recent phone call with constituents, Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=0.0s)]
*  criticized the president, accusing Trump of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic, flirting [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=6.26s)]
*  with white supremacists, and cozying up to dictators. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=11.78s)]
*  His words were not so kind as that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=14.88s)]
*  The comments were first disclosed by the Washington Examiner, which obtained an audio recording [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=16.86s)]
*  of the phone call. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=22.84s)]
*  The senator was asked specifically about his relationship with the president and why he's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=24.46s)]
*  been so critical of Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=29.34s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=31.54s)]
*  He's flirted with white supremacists. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=59.3s)]
*  At the beginning of the COVID crisis, he refused to treat it seriously. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  First he ignored COVID, and then he went into full economic shutdown mode. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  He was the one who said 10 to 14 days of shutdown would fix this, and that was always wrong. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=72.58s)]
*  And so I don't think the way he's led through COVID has been reasonable or responsible. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=78.58s)]
*  I'm worried that if President Trump loses, as looks likely, that he's going to take the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=83.7s)]
*  Senate down with him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=88.9s)]
*  I'm now looking at the possibility of a Republican bloodbath in the Senate. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  And that's why I've now agreed to serve on his reelection committee, and that's why I'm [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=95.78s)]
*  not campaigning for him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=101.34s)]
*  So we talk a lot about what Republicans say privately that they won't say publicly because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=104.5s)]
*  they're afraid of getting beat up by President Trump. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  That is the kind of thing that Republicans say privately, but have been, for the most part, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  unwilling to say in public. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=120.1s)]
*  Ben Sasse, of course, saying that on a call with constituents. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=122.5s)]
*  Entirely possible he expected it to become public, but those were not, of course, public comments. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=125.13999999999999s)]
*  A spokesperson for the senator confirmed that Sasse made those comments during a call that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  came earlier this week. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=133.22s)]
*  He is up for reelection next month in a race that he is expected to win. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=134.78s)]
*  That was post-primary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=138.82s)]
*  Ben Sasse, also an important piece of this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=140.82s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=143.46s)]
*  Thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olSIq_XQQos&t=144.82000000000002s)]
