# Trump touts popularity amid legal troubles, calling indictment a 'badge of honor'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk)
*  Welcome back. Amid his legal problems, Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail in New [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=0.0s)]
*  Hampshire yesterday. He spoke at a luncheon for the New Hampshire Federation of Republican [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=6.12s)]
*  Women and brought up his indictment in the classified documents case, saying it's only [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=11.52s)]
*  making him more popular. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=17.48s)]
*  As you know, two weeks ago, crooked Joe Biden ordered his top political opponent arrested. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=20.76s)]
*  Oh, who is that opponent? Oh, it's me. Oh, right in the middle of a presidential campaign [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  that his opponent is winning by a lot. Think of this one. This wasn't in the book. This [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=33.32s)]
*  wasn't in the playbook. But because the public is really smart, my numbers went up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists and fascists indict me, I consider [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=45.28s)]
*  a badge, a great, great, beautiful badge of honor and courage. Because I'm being indicted [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=52.08s)]
*  for you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=60.76s)]
*  That's a course recall that in 2016, Trump repeatedly said that Hillary Clinton should [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=61.76s)]
*  be arrested and then in 2020, urged his own government to investigate the Biden family. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=67.48s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump also bashed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was also campaigning in [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=72.56s)]
*  New Hampshire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  In New Hampshire, we have a 47% to DeSantis with 13%. And by the way, he's holding, he's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=81.2s)]
*  holding an event right now, which is considered not nice, you know, because candidates go [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=89.92s)]
*  through. It's not really nice, but he's holding an event right now to compete with us. There's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  only one problem. Nobody showed up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=98.34s)]
*  So indeed, DeSantis held his first town hall in New Hampshire, and it wasn't far from where [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  Trump was standing. The Florida governor took about a dozen questions from voters and he [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  was pressed on two subjects he doesn't usually talk much about. Abortion one and Trump the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=111.0s)]
*  other. A teenager asked DeSantis if he thinks Trump violated the peaceful transfer of power [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=117.12s)]
*  on January 6th. Here was the governor's response. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=122.84s)]
*  If this election is about Biden's failures and our vision for the future, we are going [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  to win. If it's about relitigating things that happened two, three years ago, we're [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=134.08s)]
*  going to lose. And so I can tell you this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=140.4s)]
*  I can tell you this. I can point you to Tallahassee, Florida on, I believe, January 5th, 2023. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=148.56s)]
*  We had a transition of power from my first administration to my second because I won [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=159.94s)]
*  reelection in a historic fashion. And at the end of the day, you know, we need to win [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=164.64s)]
*  and we need to get this done. So I wasn't anywhere near Washington that day. I have [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  nothing to do with what happened that day. Obviously, I didn't enjoy seeing, you know, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  what would happen. But we've got to go forward on this stuff. We cannot be looking backwards [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=180.05999999999997s)]
*  and be mired in the past. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv-KENhwdrk&t=185.2s)]
