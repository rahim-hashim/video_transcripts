# House member warns Trump's tariffs could impact Michigan auto plants
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ)
*  Another federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to freeze [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=0.0s)]
*  payments for grants and other federal programs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=5.92s)]
*  This is the second time a judge has paused the president's plan to halt the flow of funds [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=8.88s)]
*  that Congress has already appropriated. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=12.72s)]
*  In the 13-page order, the judge ruled that the wide-ranging directive in the OMB memo [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  that caused chaos and confusion last week actually appeared to violate the law. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=19.56s)]
*  It's a significant win for the 22 Democratic-leaning states whose attorneys general sued to stop [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=24.32s)]
*  the freeze. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=29.16s)]
*  The Justice Department, meanwhile, argued the issue is moot because the White House memo [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=30.36s)]
*  was rescinded Wednesday, two days after it was sent to federal agencies outlining a widespread [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=34.04s)]
*  freeze. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=39.28s)]
*  The judge noted that the evidence shows that the alleged rescission of the OMB directive [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=40.28s)]
*  was in name only. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  And you'll remember, the White House press secretary said it wasn't actually rescinded. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now from our home district of Oakland County is Democratic Congresswoman Hailey [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Stevens of Michigan. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks for waking up early with us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=54.84s)]
*  First, I just want to get your reaction to the funding freeze chaos that was sparked [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=56.72s)]
*  by the new Trump administration. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=60.64s)]
*  I thought you were going to ask me a fun question about Beyonce. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=62.84s)]
*  If only. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=66.44s)]
*  I'm so proud of it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=67.44s)]
*  That was a really cool moment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=68.44s)]
*  But back to the brutal reality that is the insanity of executive orders in this administration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Look, this is a palpable moment here in the United States of America and particularly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=78.92s)]
*  in Michigan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=85.2s)]
*  I am hearing from state lawmakers to nonprofits, people who got awards like the Global Epicenter [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  for Mobility focusing on Michigan's future in the automotive industry. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=94.4s)]
*  It's a major sizable grant that we received from the federal government that I helped [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  to lead on. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  And they're going to have to lay off people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=105.72s)]
*  They're going to have to stop work. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=108.0s)]
*  And of course, we're seeing major attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=109.64000000000001s)]
*  that shouldn't be blasphemous efforts in the United States of America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=115.48s)]
*  We know that for corporate America, the more diverse you are, the stronger and more profitable [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=119.92s)]
*  you are. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=125.8s)]
*  And diversity, equity, and inclusion is going to continue to be important here in metro [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=126.8s)]
*  Detroit and for Michigan and for our overall global competitiveness. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=131.48s)]
*  The other piece of this is the president's tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=136.52s)]
*  You've been posting about this on social media over the weekend. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=141.92s)]
*  You also worked on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that was a hallmark to Trump's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  first term. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=149.68s)]
*  So seeing now these latest tariffs, what do you think the impact is going to be on consumers [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=150.68s)]
*  in your state? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, let's be clear on the trade deal, USMCA. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  We needed to get that trade deal in the best position possible for American workers and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=160.12s)]
*  worker protections that were secured that are absolutely essential and securitization [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=165.72s)]
*  for by American content or by Michigan content. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=171.0s)]
*  Now with the tariffs coming down, these draconian tariffs that the president is saying is coming [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=174.92s)]
*  down on Canada actually feel like a tariff on Michiganders. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we're looking at increased costs for consumers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=183.92s)]
*  I have spent the weekend, Ali, talking about what is going to happen with plants, Michigan [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  automotive plants. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I'm hearing that some are going to shut down. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=196.76s)]
*  And so this is a tough moment for us. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=199.76s)]
*  It's not totally the way we should be going. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes tariffs can be used in a strategic and coordinated way. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=205.88s)]
*  But on our best trading partner that's going to hurt us here in Michigan, Dow futures, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  it just heard already down 600. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=214.12s)]
*  That's going to have ramification in Michigan automotive land. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=217.0s)]
*  And I don't like it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=220.44s)]
*  And it's not right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=221.44s)]
*  But the reasoning that the White House is giving and the president is giving here is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=222.92s)]
*  that this is all to stem the flow of illegal immigration and fentanyl coming through into [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=226.48s)]
*  U.S. borders. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  Is our tariffs the right way to go about fixing that? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  Do you see any upside to getting to the goal that the president is talking about? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=237.64s)]
*  Look, I worked in the administration of President Barack Obama on the U.S. auto rescue. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  I worked on the initiative that saved General Motors and Chrysler and 200,000 Michigan jobs. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=248.44s)]
*  I know this industry very well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=255.64s)]
*  And what we do not need right now are disruptions. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=257.52s)]
*  Look, Friday is going to be jobs day here, you know, here at the start of February. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=262.0s)]
*  First Friday in March is going to be a jobs day. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=266.8s)]
*  We didn't have one period of job loss in the last four years. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=269.6s)]
*  That's a very palpable metric for our country and certainly for us in Michigan, where people are [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=273.84s)]
*  working so darn hard. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  They're putting the world on wheels. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=282.04s)]
*  They're doing an incredible job. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=284.24s)]
*  And now all of a sudden we're going to say, hey, we have to stop manufacturing for today because, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=286.24s)]
*  you know what, we don't have trade at the level that we used to with Canada. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=292.64s)]
*  They buy Michigan goods. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=296.96s)]
*  We sell into Canada. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=298.68s)]
*  So, look, this administration is acting unilaterally. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=300.44s)]
*  They're not working with Congress. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=304.44s)]
*  They don't really seem to care about passing legislation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  There's a whole scuttlebutt if even the Republicans can keep the government open. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=310.6s)]
*  And I know they're going to come crawling to us as Democrats. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=315.2s)]
*  And I know to everyone at home who is worried, we are going to make some asks. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=318.52s)]
*  We are going to make some asks because if you are costing the taxpayers shutting down the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=323.88s)]
*  government, lobbying these unbelievable tariffs at us, hurting our manufacturers, we're not buying it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=328.04s)]
*  I mean, these FBI firings, these government firings, health and science firings, not appropriate. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=336.16s)]
*  So, folks, we are prepared to fight. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm fighting here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=344.68s)]
*  I'm talking about the things I'm a subject matter expert in. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=345.8s)]
*  I live and breathe Michigan manufacturing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  And we will come out on top here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=351.56s)]
*  Congresswoman, I am going to ask one question in the negative minutes that I have left with you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  As you talk about being in the fight, does that fight include running for Senate in Michigan? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=358.0s)]
*  Look, I'm taking a look at the big run. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  I love passing federal legislation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=366.44s)]
*  I love helping people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=368.8s)]
*  Gary Peters announced his retirement. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  He's been a mentor and a partner, certainly on these automotive manufacturing tariff issues. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=372.08s)]
*  So I'm taking a look at it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=378.16s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Haley Stevens of Michigan, I promise if you come back, we can talk Beyonce and Taylor Swift. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=380.64s)]
*  But thank you for joining us. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5qMLu9N7dQ&t=385.6s)]
