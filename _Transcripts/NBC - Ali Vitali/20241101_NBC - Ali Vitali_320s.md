# Trump about RFK Jr.: 'He can do anything he wants'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck)
*  He is, he really wants to, with the pesticides and the, you know, all the different things. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=0.0s)]
*  I said he could do it. He could do anything he wants. He wants to look at the vaccines. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=6.0s)]
*  He wants everything. I think it's great. I think it's great. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=11.0s)]
*  The only thing I say to Bobby is leave the liquid gold under our feet alone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=15.0s)]
*  We want to have a little gasoline. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=23.0s)]
*  That was Donald Trump suggesting that former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=27.0s)]
*  could become one of the country's leading authorities on childhood health care if Trump wins next week. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=33.0s)]
*  RFK Jr. has repeatedly amplified misinformation about vaccinations being linked to autism, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=39.0s)]
*  even though years of research from multiple countries have debunked that claim. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=45.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and associate editor of The Washington Post, Eugene Robinson. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=50.0s)]
*  He is also, of course, an MSNBC political analyst. Eugene, so good to see you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=56.0s)]
*  I have talked to a few people recently who feel like of all of Donald Trump's campaign promises, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=61.0s)]
*  maybe one of the most dangerous is this one, the idea that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could be empowered, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=67.0s)]
*  maybe the head of HHS or some of the White House health czar, title to be determined, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=72.0s)]
*  where he would be in charge of ruling out the nation's health program, including vaccinations. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's great. I think it's potentially catastrophic. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=82.0s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the great successes of public health in the history of the world [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=88.0s)]
*  that we very successfully vaccinate for childhood diseases, for other maladies that used to kill people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=95.0s)]
*  And now have been essentially eradicated. When I was a kid, long, long, long ago, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=105.0s)]
*  like measles was a thing, you know, and kids got really sick from measles. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=111.0s)]
*  And there was nothing you could do about it. It's so contagious that one kid got it, everybody got it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=116.0s)]
*  And people died, kids died from it. We've now eradicated it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=124.0s)]
*  And here comes, you know, a crackpot, a total crackpot, R.F.K. Jr., who thinks, you know, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=129.0s)]
*  vaccines cause autism, which they don't. And we could squander that progress and the result will be killing people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah, the rollbacks on public health, on climate change would be extraordinary if Trump were to win. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=144.0s)]
*  Let's hit a few other campaign topics here, Eugene. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=150.0s)]
*  Trump last night, we're going to talk about it at length, I'm sure, saying that Liz Cheney should have guns trained on her face, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=153.0s)]
*  just the latest escalation of really dangerous violent rhetoric against his political opponents, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=158.0s)]
*  whom not only has he said that if he wins, he would use the Department of Justice, the military, perhaps, to go after, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=164.0s)]
*  but we know he has previously inspired violence from his supporters. Yes. And he's potentially doing it again. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=171.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he is potentially doing it again. And step back for a second. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=177.0s)]
*  How extraordinary that is in our history that a candidate for one of our two major parties for president [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=181.0s)]
*  who might win is talking about, you know, a firing squad, essentially, or something, for a political opponent. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=190.0s)]
*  This is totally unprecedented. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=198.0s)]
*  If, you know, if it were not immediately followed by eight or nine or ten other outrageous and unprecedented things that Trump says or does, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=201.0s)]
*  it would be a month long story. It's just impossible that this is happening. But there you have it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=212.0s)]
*  I mean, it's another day in Trump land. Let's shoot Liz Cheney. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=221.0s)]
*  And then, unlikely, frankly, that it will receive the same media attention that, like, President Biden's comments from earlier this week. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=224.0s)]
*  And the president, of course, not even a candidate. Yeah, not even a candidate stumbles over the word garbage. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=229.0s)]
*  That's a huge deal. He said he's going to shoot Liz Cheney. I mean, you know, let's shoot Liz Cheney. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=234.0s)]
*  It couldn't be clearer said. Gene, we got about a minute left. Just what are your thoughts? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=240.0s)]
*  What should Vice President Harris, as we head into this final weekend, what needs to be her, like, final closing argument or two? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=244.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I think she's made her closing argument. She did that amazing event on the on the ellipse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=250.0s)]
*  I think she should keep talking about women and reproductive rights. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=257.0s)]
*  And, you know, we're going to take care of you no matter whether you like it or not. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=262.0s)]
*  I mean, that sort of thing, because I think there may be a lot of women who, you know, who could talk Trump in public and who could vote Harris in private. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=266.0s)]
*  And I certainly hope so. Yeah, there certainly is a belief that if there is sort of a hidden voter block this time around, which in 16 and 20 went for Trump this time, it might be women. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=280.0s)]
*  It might be women. It might be for Harris. There's no law that says a hidden voting block is Trump's. Could be Harris's. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=289.0s)]
*  All right. MSNBC political analyst Eugene Robinson. Eugene, thank you and stick around. We'll talk to you on Morning Joe as well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=295.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qq-rU9W7ck&t=310.0s)]
