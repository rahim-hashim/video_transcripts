# Senate to vote on border security package
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw)
*  We turn back to politics now and the Senate will hold a vote later today on the bipartisan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=0.0s)]
*  border security package that Republicans killed earlier this year. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=5.4s)]
*  The symbolic move is expected to fail with some Democrats and Republicans who supported [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=10.16s)]
*  it last time likely to vote against it this time around. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=14.8s)]
*  Democrats are forcing the move to get Republicans on the record on border security ahead of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=19.52s)]
*  November's elections. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=23.56s)]
*  The GOP says that Democrats are just playing politics. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Take a listen to one of the lead negotiators for the bill, Republican Senator James Lankford [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=29.459999999999997s)]
*  of Oklahoma, who will now be voting against his own legislation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=33.94s)]
*  The bill is no longer a bill, now it's just a prop. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=40.7s)]
*  And that's been my frustration. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=43.26s)]
*  We wrote it to be a bill to try to actually solve the problem. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=44.26s)]
*  To say if this is not going to be the solution, then let's figure out what can be the solution, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=48.22s)]
*  but let's bring in prop votes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now, politics reporter at Semaphore, Kadia Gova. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=56.66s)]
*  Kadia, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=60.5s)]
*  So let's just break down, if you will, how we got here and what you anticipate happening later today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  Well, as you brought up in the opening, Democrats are, they have an opportunity here to, you [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=69.5s)]
*  know, push the attention to Republicans and say, hey, you didn't do anything. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=77.86s)]
*  So this is going to die in the Senate. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=82.66s)]
*  It's not going anywhere in the House. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=86.5s)]
*  It's dead on arrival. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=88.22s)]
*  Speaker Johnson already said that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=89.22s)]
*  But this gives opportunity to, especially those vulnerable Democrats or Democrats in [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=91.02s)]
*  competitive elections, to say, hey, we tried to do something for the border. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=95.72s)]
*  But there's also an opportunity, I'd argue, for Joe Biden to actually, you know, say that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=100.78s)]
*  he's addressing the border issue as well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=106.74s)]
*  There are a bunch of expected executive orders that are coming up. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  Right before, I'd say, the end of June during this debate that he's going to have, this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=114.38s)]
*  is an opportunity for him to say, hey, you guys didn't pull it off in the Senate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=119.86s)]
*  Republicans blocked it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=124.34s)]
*  Here I am coming. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=125.82s)]
*  I'm going to save the day with some resolutions or some, you know, some options to clear the border. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=127.7s)]
*  So Senator Lankford, one of the authors of the bill, received a lot of praise, including [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=133.78s)]
*  on this air, for working in a bipartisan fashion to get this thing done. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=137.86s)]
*  What is his reasoning to suddenly object to it now? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=142.94s)]
*  And as a second point, do we think the Democrats are going to be able to score some political [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=147.26s)]
*  points blaming the GOP for submerging their own bill? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  Polls suggest that it hasn't really moved the needle yet. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=156.5s)]
*  Senator Lankford is just upset that the fact that it didn't pass initially, and now it's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=159.66s)]
*  used as a prop, as he said. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=164.42s)]
*  But also, I would, I would, there are also some progressive Democrats who aren't happy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=166.68s)]
*  with it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=171.48s)]
*  From their standpoint, they think that this kind of pushes the conversation back and sets [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  it at this de facto starting point. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=178.45999999999998s)]
*  It was a very conservative bill to start with, and they don't want to use this as the point [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=181.14s)]
*  going forward. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=187.26s)]
*  So there, it's interesting because Schumer's actually going to lose more votes in this run-up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  So Khadija, give us a sense, what else is happening on Capitol Hill this week? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  The legislative session largely over. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=201.34s)]
*  It is seemingly just more, it's time for us to try to score political points. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=203.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a, people will say that they are ramping up for the appropriation [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=207.3s)]
*  season, but I think a lot of attention is going to be focused on the defense bill, and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=215.3s)]
*  DAA, the National Defense Bill people are, there's markups are going to start immediately. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=220.94s)]
*  That will be a long haul, but members are going on break for another week or next week. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=228.04s)]
*  So I think you'll see things start to pivot towards like the campaign side. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  For instance, I'm going to New York today because Donald Trump will be there, and I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=240.48s)]
*  know I'll be joined by other members of Congress as well. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Trump, you know, mostly bound in New York because of his case holding an event [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=248.44s)]
*  in the South Bronx later today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  We of course will have more coverage of that later on this morning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=255.48s)]
*  Politics reporter at Semaphore, Kadia Goba, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=258.64s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0qKWaxDYrw&t=261.2s)]
