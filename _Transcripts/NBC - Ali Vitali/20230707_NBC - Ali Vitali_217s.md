Video Description: On June 5, at 8:06 p.m., Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tweeted that he was sending Florida personnel to assist Iowa with a disastrous building collapse in Davenport. Yet what DeSantis didn't say -- and what NBC News has learned through a public records request -- was that more than 10 hours earlier, the mission had been canceled and Iowa had informed the DeSantis administration that its help was no longer needed.

# DeSantis bragged about sending help to Iowa after it wasn't needed
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc)
*  The new NBC News exclusive reporting out this morning that I wanted to ask you about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's about Governor Ron DeSantis, of course, of Florida, running for president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=4.0s)]
*  He's been bragging about sending emergency aid to Iowa, Iowa, of course, the home of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=7.76s)]
*  the first Republican caucus, and he did so after Iowa leaders flat out told him it wasn't [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=12.76s)]
*  necessary. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=18.0s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=19.64s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=20.64s)]
*  So June 5th, DeSantis tweeted, he got some nice press attention in Iowa, which is obviously [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=21.64s)]
*  something you want if you are running for president, that he was sending Florida personnel [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=26.46s)]
*  to go help with this apartment building that collapsed in Davenport, Iowa, and they were [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=31.26s)]
*  doing sort of a search and rescue mission for survivors and victims. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=36.3s)]
*  And you know, he tweeted that he was deploying personnel, there were some great pictures [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=41.18s)]
*  and everything. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  But NBC News has found out through a public records request that Iowa had told him and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  earlier that day, about 10 hours before his tweet, that, hey, you don't need to send [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=53.34s)]
*  anyone, we're okay, we're fine, we don't need you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  And two Florida officials had already been deployed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  So Florida people did go, but Iowa, you know, based on emails and their confirmation to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=66.06s)]
*  us, and my colleague Matt Dixon said, look, you don't need to send anyone, it's fine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  But obviously DeSantis didn't say that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=76.36s)]
*  He got some nice headlines but did not reveal that the help was not needed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=79.3s)]
*  So Amanda, let's talk to where DeSantis is right now in his campaign. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  We mentioned a little earlier in the show, he's raised a fair amount of money, but his [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  poll numbers haven't budged. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=91.44s)]
*  He got pretty defensive about that last night in an interview on Fox News. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=92.66s)]
*  What's your assessment here, speaking to Republicans, as to whether they think DeSantis has a chance [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=98.06s)]
*  to reverse the momentum, or do they think that one of the other candidates may step [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=103.42s)]
*  up and be sort of the top Trump alternates? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  Right, money, Ron DeSantis is raising a lot of money, that's obviously always good if [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=111.3s)]
*  you're running for president, but money was never going to be Ron DeSantis' problem. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=116.3s)]
*  The problem for him is, can he convince some of those Trump voters to ditch Trump and go [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=120.54s)]
*  with him? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=127.5s)]
*  You know, right now DeSantis is still very comfortably in second in polling. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=128.5s)]
*  The other candidates, right, they haven't really seemed to be able to sort of, as much [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=133.02s)]
*  as they're trying to knock him down. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  So it's still essentially a Trump-DeSantis race, but again, Trump is so far ahead of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  DeSantis, he's comfortably in the front, Trump is going after DeSantis quite a bit, and so [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=145.06s)]
*  you know, DeSantis still has to figure out what to do to sort of knock Trump off that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=150.54s)]
*  place and it seems like what he's doing quite a bit is running to his right on issues like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=155.01999999999998s)]
*  immigration, crime and COVID. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=159.94s)]
*  And Amanda, do you think, is there another Republican in the field right now who looks [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=164.06s)]
*  like they have a little momentum or has a path to make a bit of a run, to jump into [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=169.26s)]
*  that solid third and then potentially beyond? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=174.66s)]
*  I think that is still an open question. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  I think there are a lot of candidates who are trying and we'll see, you know, DeSantis [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=180.66s)]
*  said he's ready to debate and we'll see if the other candidates, how they perform against [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=184.34s)]
*  him on the debate stage. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=188.12s)]
*  Yeah, and we do not know, of course, if Donald Trump will participate in those debates. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=189.12s)]
*  NBC's Amanda Turkle, thank you, we really appreciate you being with us this morning. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohflJSXulgc&t=193.66s)]
