# Johnson refuses to bring foreign aid bill to a vote
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson is still refusing to let the lower chamber vote on a foreign aid bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  which passed in the Senate earlier this week with bipartisan support. In his weekly press [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=5.44s)]
*  conference yesterday, Johnson claimed that the House, quote, wasn't going to be forced into action [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=10.24s)]
*  by the Senate. But he blamed the Senate for the House's own inaction on a border security bill. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=16.48s)]
*  We'll address that. We'll see what the Senate does. We spend a lot of time on the House side [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=25.52s)]
*  awaiting the Senate's action. And it's frustrating sometimes, but that's the way the process plays out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=29.68s)]
*  We are not going to be forced into action by the Senate, who in the latest product they sent us [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=34.96s)]
*  over does not have one word in the bill about America's border, not one word about security. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=41.04s)]
*  We have to address this seriously. We have to actually solve the problems and not just [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=46.08s)]
*  take political posturing as has happened in some of these other corners. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=50.72s)]
*  Let's be clear. Johnson's comments against political posturing came just one day after [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=55.12s)]
*  he led a vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for no concrete reason, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=61.44s)]
*  and simply political posturing. Joining us now, Semaphore's Deputy Washington Bureau Chief [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=68.0s)]
*  Morgan Schalfant. Morgan, good to see you again. So let's start with those House Republicans. They [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  are against this foreign aid package because it doesn't include in there a fix for the border. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=79.36s)]
*  But let's also recall that it was just a few days ago when the Senate had a border compromise bill [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=85.28s)]
*  seemingly ready, Johnson declared it dead on arrival if it even reached the lower chamber. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=90.16s)]
*  What exactly are the House Republicans trying to do? Right. So clearly, you know, Johnson's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=95.28s)]
*  comments about the package being dead on arrival were part of the reason why the Senate border [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=101.36s)]
*  security deal was derailed. I think it's unclear the path forward for this foreign aid bill. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=107.6s)]
*  Johnson obviously has said a number of things. He said he doesn't want to take up the Senate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  package as is. He wants border security after helping kill that previous package. He also has [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  suggested that he would deal with the different items separately. But I do think that we're going [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=123.44s)]
*  to see more from some moderate House Republicans in the coming days about some kind of alternative [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=128.88s)]
*  solution that includes border security. I'm not sure that's going to be palatable for [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=136.0s)]
*  House leaderships, though, just given their stance on having H.R.2, their border security package, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=140.8s)]
*  be part of this foreign aid bill. So there's a lot of questions about whether or not this can move [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=149.28s)]
*  forward. And that House, Republican House border aid package would stand little to no shot of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  getting through the Senate. So the stalemate continues. So Morgan, your latest piece for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=159.2s)]
*  Semaphore reports, though, on an effort by Democrats to potentially force a vote on that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=163.84s)]
*  foreign aid package in the House trying to get around Speaker Johnson. It seems tell us what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=170.0s)]
*  that would be and truthfully just how feasible is it? Yeah, this is something called a discharge [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=175.04s)]
*  petition. It's been under discussion by Democrats, including even last year when the White House first [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=179.76s)]
*  submitted their request for Ukraine assistance. It's tricky. It requires a majority, 218 votes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  to sign on basically to this discharge petition to force a vote on a measure. The reason it's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=195.52s)]
*  tricky for Democrats is because there are progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=200.88s)]
*  who will not sign on to this because of the Israel aid. And I think there's also not a ton [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=206.16s)]
*  of appetite right now among Republicans, even moderate Republicans, to sign on to something [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  like this because it would be them bucking their leadership. Now, does this change as the time goes [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=214.88s)]
*  on and the situation for Ukraine gets more dire and these Republicans that do want to see Ukraine [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=220.16s)]
*  aid passed, you know, lose their, you know, patience and want to see something on the floor? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=225.2s)]
*  That's possible. But right now it doesn't. It looks like this this idea is running into a lot [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=231.84s)]
*  of trouble and will not be the first step. So Morgan, it's been a run of bad headlines for the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=237.44s)]
*  speaker. His first attempt to impeach Secretary Marikas failed. They did get it done this time [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=242.72s)]
*  around. You know, we've seen the complaints about the bill, the board of security, the foreign aid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=247.84s)]
*  His majority just shrunk with Tom Swasey winning the special election in New York earlier this week. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=253.36s)]
*  How secure is Johnson's grip on the speakership? So I think that we're seeing, you know, an [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=258.32s)]
*  inexperienced speaker deal with a very narrow, very difficult majority. This would be hard for [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=264.96s)]
*  even an experienced speaker. But Johnson obviously is coming out of, you know, he's coming out of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=270.48s)]
*  the ring and file. He's not coming out of a leadership position. This was, you know, he was [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=275.04s)]
*  he was not expected. I also don't think there's a ton of appetite for the motion to vacate right now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=279.6s)]
*  I've talked to Republicans that threatened it previously that say it's not on the table, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  even if he tries to put the Ukraine aid on the floor. Possibly that changes. But right now, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=289.44s)]
*  it doesn't seem like his his role is under threat because I don't know who they replace him with. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=294.16s)]
*  And there are more challenges ahead. Let's be clear. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=299.6s)]
*  There's also government shutdown deadlines looming. So there's a lot on this speaker's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=302.48s)]
*  plate. Semaphores Morgan Chalfant, thank you for joining us this morning. We really appreciate it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=306.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F63tGLQqoZQ&t=328.72s)]
