# Biden, McCarthy face backlash over debt limit
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k)
*  We'll begin this morning on Capitol Hill, where the House Rules Committee voted in favor of advancing the debt ceiling bill to a full House vote set for later tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina joined all four Democrats on the nine-member panel in voting against the bill. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  While the bill still appears likely to pass, President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are also still receiving criticism from their party's outer flanks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=22.1s)]
*  Some Democrats in the House Progressive Caucus are still undecided on their votes for the bill over concerns of work requirements for aid recipients. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=32.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, despite reportedly receiving a standing ovation in a Republican conference meeting yesterday, McCarthy received more pushback from GOP hardliners. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=43.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=54.1s)]
*  Speaker McCarthy had a mandate from the American people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  This deal that we've heard about totally fails to deliver on all of it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=61.0s)]
*  Not one Republican should vote for this deal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  It is a bad deal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=69.5s)]
*  There's going to be a reckoning about what just occurred unless we stop this bill by tomorrow. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=71.4s)]
*  What I see here in this deal is absolutely one of the biggest abominations since I've been in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=83.2s)]
*  I had no idea that we would see a plan as ephemeral and as malodorous as this plan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=85.0s)]
*  Joining us now, congressional reporter for Axios, Sophia Kai. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  Good morning, Sophia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=97.9s)]
*  So give us your latest reporting on where things stand. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=99.0s)]
*  It cleared an important the bill cleared an important hurdle yesterday. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=103.2s)]
*  But today is the big day in the House. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=106.5s)]
*  Both sides Democrats Republicans whipping the votes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=110.1s)]
*  Give us a sense as to where what we should be looking for later on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=112.4s)]
*  Well, the bill cleared the rules committee yesterday and it got the vote of a key member, including conservative Rep Massey. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=117.1s)]
*  And that's significant because, you know, it's really an indication that McCarthy and Biden will probably squeak through with enough votes today [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=125.0s)]
*  when the full House votes on it to pass this bill. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=133.8s)]
*  I mean, and both Democrats and Republicans have something to show for to their members. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=137.3s)]
*  Democrats will say, look, this doesn't cut Social Security Medicare. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=142.4s)]
*  It doesn't cut. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=146.3s)]
*  You know, most of the things that that that Democrats want and have passed over the past year and a half. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  And the other piece of this is that Republicans can say, look, it cuts spending year over year. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  It restarts student loan payments. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, it also adds work requirements, as you mentioned earlier, with the exception of the homeless and veterans. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  I mean, these are all things that both Republicans and Democrats can tell their members. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=169.7s)]
*  Hey, look, you've got a reason to vote for the bill. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=175.2s)]
*  So let's cut through some of the Beltway noise here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=178.9s)]
*  I mean, is there an understanding, a growing understanding that the stakes are simply too high, that the nation can't default? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=181.9s)]
*  This has to get passed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=188.6s)]
*  And what we're seeing is simply a little bit of performance, a little bit of theater from the extremes, progressives. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=190.1s)]
*  Yes, but particularly on the hard right where they need to sort of appease their constituents with the safety of knowing like, hey, this will actually get done. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=195.4s)]
*  What's your read on that? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=204.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, yesterday, both the Democratic and Republican House campaign arms told us that they wouldn't be running negative ads based on the debt ceiling vote. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=206.8s)]
*  And this is very different than the position they were in even just a couple of weeks ago. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=219.5s)]
*  You know, when when when each side was especially Democrats were promising to hit those Biden district Republicans on their vote on the debt ceiling. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=224.0s)]
*  And so this is a significant shift. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=234.6s)]
*  And I think it's a sign that even the politicos in D.C. and on the campaign trail recognize that this is an important vote. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=236.5s)]
*  This is something that has today done. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=244.4s)]
*  It's many months in the making. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=246.6s)]
*  It's also been interesting to watch some of the Republican presidential candidates, some of them be critical of the bill, but yet not like, say, Ron DeSantis say Republicans shouldn't vote for it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  And we should note that Sophia has a sit down with Senator Tim Scott running for president later today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=257.6s)]
*  We'll look for that congressional reporter. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=262.8s)]
*  I'm your host, Scott Axios via CAI. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=264.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9DJ31je79k&t=266.2s)]
