# Pence slams Trump over Jan. 6 attack as he eyes 2024 run
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ)
*  Joining us now, White House and politics team leader for Bloomberg News, Mario Parker. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Mario, good morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=6.04s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=7.44s)]
*  You wrote up about Mike Pence's comments in your latest piece for Bloomberg. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=8.72s)]
*  Tell us more about what Pence said at the gridiron and what was the reaction like in [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=13.48s)]
*  the room? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=17.76s)]
*  Were they caught off guard? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=18.76s)]
*  Yeah, we were caught off guard, Jonathan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=19.76s)]
*  As you mentioned in your introduction, the gridiron is usually a jovial place where you [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=22.68s)]
*  have folks like Mike Pence poking fun at themselves and others. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=27.96s)]
*  And he did just that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  He was cracking jokes about himself. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=32.96s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump, he took a swipe at Ron DeSantis' populist stance despite having [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=35.36s)]
*  an Ivy League background. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  And then he started speaking about January 6th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=44.92s)]
*  And we weren't sure where he was going with it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=48.24s)]
*  The room turned a little bit more quiet. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  And then I think everyone started to collectively look around at each other like, hey, this is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=53.56s)]
*  a moment here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=57.44s)]
*  He just kept elaborating and expounding upon some of those things that you mentioned, that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=58.44s)]
*  he felt like his life was in danger, that President Trump was wrong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=63.68s)]
*  And then the most strongest comment that history will judge former President Donald Trump. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=67.84s)]
*  And so it was quite clear that there was a moment in the room. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=74.84s)]
*  You could tell that the energy had shifted. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=79.28s)]
*  We should note that unlike the White House Correspondents' Dinner, which is broadcast [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=81.68s)]
*  on C-SPAN, very much on the record, this event is done off camera. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=86.2s)]
*  So what's the sense of folks you've talked to among Republicans and elsewhere in Washington [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=90.28s)]
*  as what Pence's motivations here might be? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=95.0s)]
*  It certainly would seem to be like he's trying to create at least one real wedge issue with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=97.28s)]
*  Trump as he considers his own 2024 presidential bid. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=101.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=106.0s)]
*  As you smartly know, Jonathan, it was off camera, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=107.0s)]
*  So Pence has the benefit of us reporting this for him and signal boosting it without the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=111.32s)]
*  video evidence, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=116.36s)]
*  I was able to catch up with the former Vice President immediately after his remarks, and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=118.32s)]
*  he said that this is something that's been going on for a while, that he had been mulling, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=122.08s)]
*  and he thought this was the right venue to make those comments. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  Someone else close to the former Vice President said that he had been making those similar [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=130.16s)]
*  comments behind closed doors and to donors, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=133.92s)]
*  So that's the key word, to donors. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  So it does look like he's trying to create a lane in which he's able to say, distance [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=139.76s)]
*  himself from former President Donald Trump in terms of saving democracy or standing up [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=145.56s)]
*  for democracy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=151.04s)]
*  And this is maybe a lane that he could create and maybe catapult himself into 2024. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=152.56s)]
*  Mario, great hustle by you to get the former Vice President after his remarks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=157.56s)]
*  And we should underscore here again, he has refused to cooperate in all the investigations [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=161.64s)]
*  into Donald Trump, even as perhaps these comments were welcome. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  Bloomberg's Mario Parker, thank you so much for joining us this morning and speaking. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRM6bmQ4dmQ&t=170.88s)]
