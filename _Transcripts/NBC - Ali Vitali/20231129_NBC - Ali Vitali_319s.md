# Koch-backed network endorses Nikki Haley in Republican primary
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ)
*  The influential conservative political network financed largely by billionaire Charles Koch [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  is now endorsing former UN ambassador Nikki Haley in the Republican primary. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=6.0s)]
*  A statement by Americans for Prosperity Action reads in part this way. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=11.28s)]
*  When we announced our decision to engage in our first ever Republican presidential primary, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  we made it clear that we'd be looking for a candidate who can turn the page on our political [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  dysfunction and win. It's clear that candidate isn't Haley. According to sources familiar with [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=27.28s)]
*  the decision, the choice came down to Haley and Florida governor Ron DeSantis, but the endorsement [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=34.08s)]
*  went to Haley due to better poll numbers and being more ideologically aligned with the network. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now, politics reporter for 7.4, our friend Shelby Talcott. Shelby, great to see you [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=46.64s)]
*  this morning. So walk us through the thinking behind this decision, what your sources are saying, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=52.48s)]
*  why Haley and does it matter in a race where Donald Trump has such a commanding lead? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the big thing, as you said, is the polling numbers. AFP Action has been doing this for months [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=64.8s)]
*  and months. They've been on the ground talking to voters in these early voting states. I was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=70.88s)]
*  on the ground with them last month and sort of saw firsthand that they are targeting two kinds of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=75.92s)]
*  voters. They're targeting these soft Trump voters who are voters who their first choice is Trump, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=81.2s)]
*  but they're open to picking somebody else. And then they're also targeting these, this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=86.8s)]
*  sect of Republican voters who just want to turn the page and want new leadership. And the first [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=91.2s)]
*  thing I'll say is there's, there is a significant base for them to play with. The ultimate question [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=96.4s)]
*  is, do those voters ultimately vote for Nikki Haley over someone like Donald Trump? But it came [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=102.4s)]
*  down to polling and it came down to the fact that that Ron DeSantis has been struggling [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=109.68s)]
*  for months in his polling numbers as Nikki Haley has been rising. And ultimately AFP Action looked [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=115.2s)]
*  at those numbers, looked at the favor abilities of Nikki Haley versus Ron DeSantis and decided, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=121.12s)]
*  listen, she's the one to back against Donald Trump. She's in the best position to take him on. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=126.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the Koch organization certainly does not quite wield the cloud it used to in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=131.68s)]
*  the now Trumpified Republican party, but we'll see if it makes a difference there. Shelby, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=136.08s)]
*  let's talk Iowa, which leave, look at the counter. It's sooner than you might think. Voters are going [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=140.0s)]
*  to be voting in six or so weeks time. I know Donald Trump is heading back to that state this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=145.12s)]
*  weekend for a series of events. Give us the latest from what you know of the state of play in Iowa. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  Listen, it's still as far as Donald Trump's team is concerned, Trump's race to lose at the same time. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=158.0s)]
*  You see all of these other candidates with the exception of Chris Christie are really going all [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=165.2s)]
*  in on Iowa and their expectation in the state is not necessarily to come out number one against [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=170.72s)]
*  Trump. It's to come in a close enough second where they're competing. And again, as we talked about [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=176.72s)]
*  for the past few months on this show, ultimately the non-Trump alternatives want to be the last [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  standing non-Trump alternative. And so for them, that means we don't necessarily have to win in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=188.72s)]
*  Iowa. We just have to be competitive. Right. And if that person is say a Nikki Haley who finishes [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=193.52s)]
*  strong in Iowa, strong in New Hampshire, strong in South Carolina, even if it's a couple of second [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=198.24s)]
*  places, then going forward, the non-Trump forces, the thought being rally around her. We'll see if [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=201.84s)]
*  that happens though, because polls suggest that a lot of people's second choice is Donald Trump, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=206.8s)]
*  even if he's not there first. Shelby, there's another Republican debate for some reason [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=210.8s)]
*  next week. Give us a sense as to whether any of the candidates involved thinks it could change [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=216.0s)]
*  the trajectory of the race at all. I've heard campaigns argue that it is making [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=221.04s)]
*  a difference, particularly with Nikki Haley's team who has, you know, Nikki Haley has consistently [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=228.0s)]
*  performed pretty well in the debates. But still, when you look at the poll numbers, Nikki Haley's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=232.72s)]
*  rise, I think it's important to keep in mind she's still far behind Donald Trump. And so I've also [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=237.04s)]
*  heard the argument from campaigns that it isn't really making a difference. And so it doesn't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=242.0s)]
*  matter as much whether they make this debate stage or not. And Shelby, give us a sense of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=246.16s)]
*  finances here. Where do these candidates stand in terms of just having access to the money they're [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=251.28s)]
*  going to need to stay on the air, to stay viable for these first few months of primaries? Yeah, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=256.08s)]
*  that's a really good question. And certainly some of the candidates are a little bit more strapped [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=261.28s)]
*  for cash than others. Chris Christie doesn't have as much in the bank, but he's being a little bit [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=265.04s)]
*  more conservative than some of his opponents. And so I think his team expects to stay through New [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=269.92s)]
*  Hampshire, which is really his focus. You've got Ron DeSantis, who is being forced for several [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=274.8s)]
*  months now to really lean heavily on his super PAC. And we've seen infighting in the super PAC. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=280.08s)]
*  And so that's kind of affecting his standing. And then Nikki Haley, honestly, with this AFP action, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=285.2s)]
*  she's going to have a lot of money behind her in terms of ad money. And so that's going to really [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=291.52s)]
*  boost her, I think. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5HzgLm9FUQ&t=297.28s)]
