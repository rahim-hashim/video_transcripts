# Rep. Dingell: I will do anything I can to keep the government open
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8)
*  Welcome back. With the threat of another government shutdown looming, lawmakers are set to return [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=0.0s)]
*  to Capitol Hill next month and face a packed schedule. The federal government will run [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=6.08s)]
*  out of money on September 30th. Between now and then, there are only about 11 days where [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=11.4s)]
*  both the House and Senate will be in session. Besides the shutdown threat and a broader [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=17.42s)]
*  dispute over defense spending levels, the Senate could also miss the deadline to reauthorize [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  a $1 trillion farm bill. There's also the matter of funding for Ukraine. And of course, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=29.02s)]
*  Senator Tuberville holds on military promotions. A lot happening in Capitol Hill. And we're [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=34.46s)]
*  glad that Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan joins us to help walk [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  us through it. She of course sits on the House energy and commerce committees. Congresswoman, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=44.22s)]
*  great to see you. So let's just start right there. There's only 10, 11 days worth of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=49.06s)]
*  working days in September for both Houses of Congress and a lot needs to get done. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=53.82s)]
*  How concerned are you that it can all happen and that the government can stay open? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=59.74s)]
*  Well, good morning. It's good to be with you. And I am scared to death that we're going [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=64.94s)]
*  to shut the government down. You know, in D.C. for a day for some meetings. And as I [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=69.22s)]
*  walked through the airport, all of the T.S.A. asked me, are you going to keep the government [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=75.38s)]
*  shutting down? What's going to happen to us? I don't think people realize one, it's not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=81.3s)]
*  a way to run a government. It is not effective. It is not efficient. It is not correct. But [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=85.7s)]
*  the real people's lives at stake. And it's a very small group of people that are going [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  to determine whether this government stays open or not. And I will do anything I can [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=94.42s)]
*  to keep the government open. And what's your analysis right now in terms of Speaker McCarthy [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=98.9s)]
*  and how he has to at times bend to the whims of sort of pretty far right members of his [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=105.02s)]
*  conference, many of whom seem eager to embrace a shutdown? Well, it's very clear that he [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=112.02s)]
*  does have some people in his caucus. And I'm not saying our caucus doesn't have some people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  at times that are like that too. So I want to be even handed. But there are people in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=122.46s)]
*  his caucus that clearly want to shut the government down. And I don't know what direction Speaker [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=126.78s)]
*  McCarthy is going to go in yet. Is he? Look, I'm a Democrat that will vote. I mean, if [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=131.66s)]
*  it's not ludicrous, if it's not irresponsible, will vote to keep the government open because [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=136.46s)]
*  I know the people's whose lives it's going to impact. I know the functions that are critical [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=141.14000000000001s)]
*  to keeping this country safe and would support it. But I don't think that this is really [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=145.34s)]
*  in the hands of Democrats right now. I think it's in Speaker McCarthy's hands and a small [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=151.02s)]
*  group. I've talked to Republicans who are scared to death that government's going to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=155.94s)]
*  be shut down. He has members of his caucus that don't want it to happen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=159.94s)]
*  Yeah, there seem to be some momentum building for a short term spending resolution, but [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=163.7s)]
*  we'll see what happens when everyone gets back to town. Congressman, I want to turn to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=167.42s)]
*  a matter that's certainly important for someone who represents the state of Michigan, and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=172.06s)]
*  that's United Auto Workers members voting overwhelmingly to authorize strikes at GM [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=175.18s)]
*  and Ford, among other plants, looking for a significant wage increase in other measures. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=180.42s)]
*  Give us your reaction as to what is happening there, something that's near and dear to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  your home state. Look, I've spent a lot of time with UAW, spent a lot of time with the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=189.86s)]
*  auto companies. I am someone who talked to somebody every day. I think that people need [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=194.86s)]
*  to take this very seriously. I think we could see a strike. And if we do see a strike, the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=200.14000000000001s)]
*  impact on our economy, nobody even understands. It'll put us in a recession for the fourth [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=207.02s)]
*  quarter. I believe that I've talked to everybody. I know that there are a lot of tough [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=211.46s)]
*  discussions going on. I'm trying to make sure everybody is hearing what each is saying. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=216.42s)]
*  I think people don't realize that you have auto workers that are making less. Ultimately, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=224.7s)]
*  the battery plant in Ohio has just reached an agreement, but they were making $16 an [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  hour, and people could go to the McDonald's and make $23 an hour. People are worried and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=236.26s)]
*  scared about their jobs. I've got a plant in my district that may close. These are real [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=241.38s)]
*  issues. My workers are scared. I warned people that my workers were scared in 2016 and Donald [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=245.9s)]
*  Trump could win. And I don't think Donald Trump is going to help these workers. I want [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  to make that clear too. But Michigan is a state people need to be paying attention to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=255.5s)]
*  right now. Our workers are worried about their future and deserve to be paid a decent wage. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=260.7s)]
*  Yeah, extraordinarily important words here, both in the short term, the summer of labor [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=265.7s)]
*  discontent, but also, as you say, consequences potentially for next year's election. It's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=270.38s)]
*  always a pleasure to be joined by Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=274.34s)]
*  Thank you for being with us this morning. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEEOj1AFtv8&t=278.26s)]
