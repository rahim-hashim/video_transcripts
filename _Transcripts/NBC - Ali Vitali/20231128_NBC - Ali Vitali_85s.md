# Trump again threatens to repeal Obamacare
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4)
*  The Biden administration says it plans to hit back after Donald Trump revived his threat [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=0.0s)]
*  to repeal Obamacare this past weekend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=5.92s)]
*  On social media on Saturday, the 2024 Republican frontrunner wrote that he is seriously looking [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=9.48s)]
*  at alternatives to the Affordable Care Act if he were to win next year's presidential [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=15.68s)]
*  election. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=20.84s)]
*  Of course, Trump vowed to gut Obamacare before he was even elected the first time, but once [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=21.84s)]
*  he entered the Oval Office, he failed to follow through and never even presented an alternative [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  health care plan. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=32.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Biden campaign says it plans to seize on this latest threat using TV ads [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  and other media. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=40.06s)]
*  No tactic is out of the question, a campaign adviser is telling NBC News, adding that they'll [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=42.26s)]
*  present Trump's plan as part of a, quote, deeply historically unpopular agenda that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=46.56s)]
*  Republicans are running on. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=52.94s)]
*  You'll recall that though there was no alternative health care plan, Trump did lead an effort [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=54.64s)]
*  to repeal Obamacare, but it was defeated in the Senate by the late Senator John McCain. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHxE5dCcZc4&t=58.6s)]
