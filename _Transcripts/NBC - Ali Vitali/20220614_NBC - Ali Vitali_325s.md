# Second Hearing Showcased Trump As 'Detached From Reality'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE)
*  The Biden administration is expected to announce more military aid for Ukraine as early as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=0.0s)]
*  this week. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=6.4s)]
*  According to a defense official, this aid will come from the Ukraine Security Assistance [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Initiative. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=11.84s)]
*  That money can be used for training, equipping, and advising Ukrainian forces. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=12.96s)]
*  The U.S. has allocated more than $6 billion to this fund as part of the $54 billion aid [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=18.2s)]
*  package approved by Congress last month. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=24.2s)]
*  The defense official also said that a second military aid package could be announced next [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=26.92s)]
*  week through the Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the administration to send military [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=31.8s)]
*  aid from U.S. stocks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=37.32s)]
*  Joining us now, Professor of History at New York University, Ruth Ben-Giott. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  She is the author of the book Strongmen, Mussolini to the Present, certainly familiar with Vladimir [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=44.8s)]
*  Putin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  Professor, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  Russian forces have been advancing in eastern Ukraine now for a few weeks, making slow but [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=53.48s)]
*  sadly steady progress. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  We're hearing from Kiev every day, we need more weapons, we need more weapons, we need [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=60.48s)]
*  more weapons, we need more training on those weapons. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=64.36s)]
*  What else can the U.S. and allies do right now to stem the tide of the Russian advance? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  I think we're at a really a crisis point, and it's very, very important to support Ukraine [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=74.32s)]
*  and give all the weapons that it desperately needs that President Zelensky is asking for. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=83.08s)]
*  And the U.S. may need to give more to compensate for countries like Germany, which are delaying [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=90.08s)]
*  shipments of the kinds of heavy artillery and heavy weapons that are needed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  And it's very frustrating for those of us who care about democracy and seeing the example [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=105.68s)]
*  that was set at the beginning with sanctions and this global outpouring of economic weapons [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=111.68s)]
*  against Putin to see this delay when it's most needed. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Certainly, you just spoke about the need to defend democracy abroad. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=121.56s)]
*  We're also seeing in the January 6th hearings the need to defend democracy at home. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=126.6s)]
*  And so much of the case the committee is making is how former President Trump tried to overturn [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=131.28s)]
*  the will of the people, tried to ignore the basic tenets of democracy and not abide by [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=136.4s)]
*  the results of a free and fair election. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=141.08s)]
*  Give us the important lessons. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  What should the American people be taking away from these hearings beyond just the mechanics [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  of what Trump doing, but the broad strokes? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=149.68s)]
*  You know, the big picture, and it's just very fascinating having written this book about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=152.12s)]
*  strong men to see this playing out as a case study where, you know, Trump was fundamentally [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=158.28s)]
*  had different motives and different interest in being in office than any other president, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=166.24s)]
*  Republican or Democrat. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=172.44s)]
*  He was really in office for the autocratic goals of amassing as much power as possible. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=174.68s)]
*  And you see that he doesn't really listen to people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=180.16s)]
*  He may have listened to a drunk Giuliani because Giuliani was a loyalist and everybody was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=182.44s)]
*  telling him the same thing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  But you see this, of course, with Putin too. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=188.4s)]
*  They don't really listen to people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=190.76s)]
*  They're not really interested in input because they think they have all the answers and they're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=192.32s)]
*  going to do what they need to do. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=196.16s)]
*  The second is that Trump was in office for to make money off of the presidency. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=197.8s)]
*  That's that's very clear. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=203.64s)]
*  And I'd remind people that the Washington Post had a very interesting investigation [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=204.96s)]
*  that for the first three years of his presidency, basically until covid came, he spent one third [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=210.08s)]
*  of his time not in the White House, but visiting Trump branded properties. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=215.4s)]
*  Promoting the Trump brand is a continuity. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  And indeed, the what's come out yesterday when Representative Loughran said that the big lie [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=224.32s)]
*  was a big ripoff is that the Election Defense Fund was funneling money, including 200000 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=230.56s)]
*  to Trump hotel chain. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  So the big lie and election denial was a very efficient method of Trump raising money and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=238.2s)]
*  fleecing his followers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=245.0s)]
*  And certainly we all know this hearing has come as President former President Trump considers [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=247.6s)]
*  another run in 2024. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  And I think democracy in great peril if he were able to push past this moment and run [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  and successfully again. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=261.68s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giott, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=262.96s)]
*  Coming up on Morning Joe, we'll look at what's at stake at primary races as voters go to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=265.91999999999996s)]
*  the polls in five more states today. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  Steve Kornacki will be at the big board. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=273.08s)]
*  Plus, Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia joins the conversation as he campaigns [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=275.24s)]
*  to keep his seat in one of the most closely watched races of the fall. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=280.52s)]
*  Also ahead, we'll hear from one of the 20 senators who struck a bipartisan deal on the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  gun safety framework, Democrat Chris Coons. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=289.44s)]
*  And we'll have more on yesterday's January 6 committee hearing on Donald Trump's big [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=293.2s)]
*  lie and his big ripoff. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=297.12s)]
*  A member of the House select committee, Congressman Zoe Loughran is a guest. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Morning Joe, a few moments away. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS_zA2DcUiE&t=303.92s)]
