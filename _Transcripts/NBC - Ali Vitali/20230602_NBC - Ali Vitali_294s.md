# GOP's border one-upmanship
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts)
*  Joining us now with a look at Axios AM, the co-founder of Axios, Mike Allen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=0.0s)]
*  There's no doubting what his name is. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=6.72s)]
*  Mike, what is the Axios one big thing for this morning? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=8.22s)]
*  Depending on the day, I see what you're doing there way too early. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Happy Friday and good morning, Jonathan. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  The Axios one big thing is the GOP's immigration one-upmanship battle. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=17.78s)]
*  So if you are an ambitious Republican, if you're a Republican governor who eventually [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=24.0s)]
*  wants to be president, if you're running for president now, you are trying to be all in on the border. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=29.0s)]
*  And Jonathan, why this matters, this shows how much the Republican Party has changed in the era of Trump, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=35.0s)]
*  how permanently Trump has changed the party. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=41.64s)]
*  Just this week, you had five Republican governors announcing that they were deploying [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=45.36s)]
*  National Guard troops to the Texas-Mexico border. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=51.16s)]
*  We see those governors there and those five were following Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=54.48s)]
*  who two weeks ago did that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, another Republican, had asked for this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=64.16s)]
*  They say that in addition to the border, also dealing with fentanyl issues. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=69.32s)]
*  But Jonathan, we're seeing it out on the trail. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=74.44s)]
*  I watched President Trump start to go after, start to amp up his own border rhetoric. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=77.28s)]
*  This week in Iowa, we saw Governor DeSantis get applause when he talked about sending people to Martha's Vineyard. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=87.64s)]
*  So this is an issue that every poll shows Republicans want more action on. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  And if you want to move up as a Republican, you're trying to deliver on that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=103.32s)]
*  It's a great point how the politics have changed, how we've come so far since the George W. Bush administration's approach to immigration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=107.2s)]
*  to now what the GOP is doing in the age of Trump. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=113.08s)]
*  Mike, Axios has got a scoop this morning. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  What are you guys hearing about a Trump pollster and Florida Governor DeSantis? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=116.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is Tony Fabrizio, who has polled for Trump in the past. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=122.6s)]
*  And he put out a polling memo, which was obtained by Axios Alex Thompson, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=127.24s)]
*  that is titled the DeSantis electability myth. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=132.52s)]
*  And, Jonathan, why this matters? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=138.28s)]
*  This shows how the Florida governor is getting in his constituent Donald Trump's head down there in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=140.56s)]
*  The Trump forces are saying that the press is baking in the idea that the Florida governor might be more electable [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=149.88s)]
*  in a general election than President Trump. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=160.52s)]
*  This memo has data to say that the Florida governor would have trouble in swing states. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=164.12s)]
*  But this week we saw Florida governor, I watched a couple of them. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=171.16000000000003s)]
*  Today we watched him in Iowa, like starting that type of campaigning that people question whether it was in his arsenal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=175.0s)]
*  Can he go out and do the kind of campaigning that people in these states want? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=182.68s)]
*  So many people, they want to touch and see him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=189.48s)]
*  And we saw the governor's wife, Casey DeSantis, out there this week greeting who she calls her fellow mamas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=192.44s)]
*  So, first of all, I think his line about Trump's family all moving to Florida under his governorship is pretty good. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=201.8s)]
*  But give us your quick analysis, though, of how it's gone so far. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=207.44s)]
*  DeSantis is finally taking the fight to Trump, at least a little bit. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=210.28s)]
*  What are Republicans telling you? Do they think it's working? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=212.88s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that people who are for DeSantis are very happy to see him engaged. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=215.64s)]
*  There will be real second guessing of his decision to wait. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=221.6s)]
*  He had his legislature in session. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=225.64s)]
*  I've covered legislatures over the years like that takes the governor's full focus. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=228.44s)]
*  But it did give Trump open field running. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=233.92s)]
*  And if you're Donald Trump and you have an open field, you take it. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=236.92s)]
*  You already see him going after his former ally, advisor, friend, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=240.28s)]
*  who is going to announce next week as part of a big passable announcements that we have coming, including in Iowa, former Vice President Pence. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=247.68s)]
*  Yeah, Vice President Pence, as you say, set to announce on his birthday next week also the governor of North Dakota also jumping in the race. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  Conventional wisdom is that might be good for Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=264.52s)]
*  We shall see if they can all find their separate lanes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=266.92s)]
*  Mike Allen, thank you so much for the weekend, Jonathan. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=269.2s)]
*  Have a great weekend, Mike. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wO3kDDvqts&t=272.0s)]
