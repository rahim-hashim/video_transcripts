# Trump defends keeping classified documents
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4)
*  So, Meredith, we played at the top of the show some of Trump's interview with Brett [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=0.0s)]
*  Baer last night on Fox News. Got contentious. Baer flat out said, hey, you didn't win in 2020. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=3.6s)]
*  Trump also offered a lot of shifting explanations for his possession of the classified documents. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=8.48s)]
*  What were a couple of your takeaways from Trump in his first interview since all this went down? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=13.36s)]
*  Yeah, these were some of Trump's most expansive comments that he's made yet about the documents [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  case posted. This is his first television interview after the arraignment. He was talking [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=25.76s)]
*  about how he didn't have enough time to go through the boxes, how the boxes contained a lot of his [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  own personal documents, news clippings, even golf shirts, he said, was part of the stuff that was [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=38.72s)]
*  in there. And he simply didn't have the time to go through all of that. And that's something that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  Brett Baer pressed him on in the interview. And I'm going to be curious as to how this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=52.88s)]
*  could interview could potentially be used against him in court. I doubt that many criminal defense [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  attorneys would be thrilled about their client going on national television to talk about a case [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=67.12s)]
*  and to talk about a case that involves things like classified documents. But Trump continued [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  to say he's in the clear here. He told Brett Baer he's not worried about some of these [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=79.52s)]
*  charges that are coming against him. But this did offer a new defense from Trump and a new reason [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=85.28s)]
*  for him to want to keep these classified documents with him at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great point that he may be just creating more legal trouble for himself, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  much like he did in that CNN town hall, which opened himself up to being sued by [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll yet again. National political correspondent for Politico, Meredith McRaw. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=107.2s)]
*  Thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q451THH9w4&t=112.0s)]
