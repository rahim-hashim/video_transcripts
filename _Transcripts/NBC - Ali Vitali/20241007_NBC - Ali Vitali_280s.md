# Biden says he does not know whether election will be peaceful
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4)
*  I'm confident it will be free and fair. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know whether it will be peaceful. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=4.48s)]
*  The things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out, when he didn't [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=6.84s)]
*  like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=12.16s)]
*  Have you noticed? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=16.64s)]
*  I noticed that the vice presidential Republican candidate did not say he'd accept the outcome [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=18.32s)]
*  of the election. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=23.12s)]
*  And he didn't even accept the outcome of the last election. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=24.12s)]
*  So I'm concerned about what they're going to do. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=27.44s)]
*  That was President Biden on Friday, making his first ever appearance in the White House [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=32.64s)]
*  briefing room. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  And he delivered a warning about the peaceful transfer of power after November's election. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  Joining us now, national political correspondent for Politico, Meredith McGrath. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=42.68s)]
*  Meredith, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=46.96s)]
*  So let's talk right there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  The president's not wrong. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  The Republican ticket has not pledged to honor the results of this coming election. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=50.56s)]
*  I know law enforcement is deeply concerned about the possibility of more violence this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=55.52s)]
*  time around. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=59.68000000000001s)]
*  What are you hearing from other Republicans? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=60.88s)]
*  What do they think might happen? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=63.14s)]
*  Well, President Biden said that he expected a free and fair election, but he really did [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=65.44s)]
*  stop short of expressing confidence that there would be a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  And we know that there are serious concerns from the federal government about January [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  6, about the possibility of violence again. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=79.28s)]
*  We know that DHS Secretary Mayorkas has made January 6 and the electoral vote count a special [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=82.24s)]
*  national security event. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=90.36s)]
*  There's going to be beefed up security this time around, an extra scrutiny on how Secret [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=92.0s)]
*  Service of course handles this event again. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  But, you know, Biden is responding to JD Vance on the debate stage last week saying, or not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=100.72s)]
*  the question about whether he or not he and Trump would accept the election results. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=108.94s)]
*  And it comes to, as we heard at the Butler rally over the weekend, you know, Trump and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  people like Elon Musk saying that this could be the last election if he doesn't win. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  Yes, Meredith, you led me to exactly where I wanted to go next. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=124.82s)]
*  There's so much happening this weekend. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=128.54s)]
*  I think sort of somewhat overlooked that President, former President Trump returned to Butler [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=130.22s)]
*  County, the exact site of the assassination attempt back in July to hold another rally. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=135.10000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk, as you mentioned, made a cameo. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  Tell us more about what we heard. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=143.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, this was part celebration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=146.3s)]
*  It was part of commemoration where they gave tribute to one of Trump's supporters who lost [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=148.62s)]
*  his life and the two others who were injured and just the heroin and traumatic aspect of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=155.78s)]
*  that day. But of course, it was also a Trump rally. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=160.98000000000002s)]
*  And so it was filled with all the hallmark features of a Trump rally itself. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=164.34s)]
*  But, you know, we noted in our story at Politico just about how this is a different political [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  circumstance for Trump coming into this rally. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=175.62s)]
*  He needs to win Pennsylvania. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  It's a must win battleground state for the Harris and Trump campaigns. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=180.94s)]
*  And so part of this, too, was about ginning up support in that part of the state as well. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=184.18s)]
*  Yeah, you could not be more right in the aftermath of that assassination attempt. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=190.46s)]
*  His last visit in Butler, Trump was riding high in the polls. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=194.3s)]
*  He went into the convention, opened up a real lead. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=198.22s)]
*  It felt like it was his race to lose. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  But then President Biden dropped out. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=203.02s)]
*  And now we have a dead heat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=204.86s)]
*  So talk to us about where the Trump team feels, where they feel this race is and what states [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=206.66000000000003s)]
*  do they feel the best about or perhaps those they're worried about? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, when I've talked to people in the Trump campaign, they express a kind of quiet [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  confidence about things and the polling that they're seeing internally across battleground [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=219.82s)]
*  states. But look, when you look at this race, it could not be any closer. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=225.82s)]
*  It's hard to say if anyone's up or down at any one moment in this campaign. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  And it really, you know, feels like as we're now in the month of October, it's it's hard [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=235.14s)]
*  to imagine what sort of October surprise might actually be able to move the needle at all [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  in this race. Yeah, there's certainly already been a bunch of newsworthy events. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=245.42s)]
*  In the last couple of days, the first days of October, the polls, at least for now, remain [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=249.86s)]
*  unchanged. National political correspondent for Politico, Meredith McGroth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=254.06s)]
*  Thank you, as always. We'll talk to you again real soon. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va8aEezMPu4&t=257.78000000000003s)]
