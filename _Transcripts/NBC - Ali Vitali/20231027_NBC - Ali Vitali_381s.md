# New speaker dismisses new gun safety legislation
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts)
*  The new House Speaker is calling this week's mass shootings in Maine a tragedy, but says [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=0.0s)]
*  it is not the time to talk about any new gun safety legislation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=5.7s)]
*  We are receiving information about this horrific tragedy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=10.68s)]
*  It has moved everyone in the Congress, as you might imagine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Our hearts go out to all those involved. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=16.34s)]
*  The families, of course, of the victims. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=18.8s)]
*  And we're so grateful for law enforcement. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=20.8s)]
*  We trust and hope and pray that they're able to apprehend this individual as quickly as [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=22.8s)]
*  possible. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=26.88s)]
*  There's no more injury or loss of life. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=27.88s)]
*  At the end of the day, the problem is the human heart. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=30.92s)]
*  It's not guns, it's not the weapons. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=33.6s)]
*  At the end of the day, we have to protect the right of the citizens to protect themselves. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=35.8s)]
*  And that's the Second Amendment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=39.68s)]
*  And that's why our party stands so strongly for that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=40.76s)]
*  This is not the time to be talking about legislation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=43.94s)]
*  We're in the middle of that crisis right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=45.92s)]
*  Joining us now, founder of the conservative website, The Bullwork, our friend Charlie [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=48.92s)]
*  Sykes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=53.04s)]
*  Charlie seems to me this is exactly the time to talk about gun legislation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=54.04s)]
*  And it does seem that guns have a role to play here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=57.68s)]
*  It's not just the human heart. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=59.76s)]
*  But talk to us about this dynamic you're seeing here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  It's another horrible mass shooting and yet another moment where Republicans, at least [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=64.2s)]
*  most of them, don't want to talk about it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=68.12s)]
*  Yeah, we've been here before, haven't we? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=70.48s)]
*  This is depressingly familiar, this call that this is not the time to talk about. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=73.0s)]
*  Whether there's any public policy that can prevent this kind of tragedy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=79.12s)]
*  Well, of course, this is exactly the time that we need to discuss this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=83.16s)]
*  I feel like this is this dark groundhog day that we continually have. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=88.96s)]
*  We have a mass horror, the same sort of deflection, the same sort of refusal to deal with it in [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=94.4s)]
*  any sort of a serious manner. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=100.72s)]
*  And then it's rinse and repeat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=105.52s)]
*  And I have to say that this is one of the things where I worry that our political classes [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  become completely numb. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=113.88s)]
*  If this was a terrorist attack, if this was some foreign invader who had killed this many [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=115.72000000000001s)]
*  people, this country would mobilize. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  We would not have the new speaker of the House of Representatives saying there's absolutely [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=122.92s)]
*  nothing that we can do, that it is an insoluble problem. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=125.92s)]
*  And yet here we are once again, and Jonathan will be back here again having this exact [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  same conversation, maybe within a few months, maybe within a few weeks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=136.56s)]
*  But we know what's going to happen. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=141.28s)]
*  Yeah, I sadly suspect you are right, Charlie. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  You have many disappointed with Speaker Johnson's comments there about this mass shooting. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=146.16s)]
*  Beyond that, what's your early read on his first couple of days with the gavel? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=152.04s)]
*  He certainly, as we just talked about in the last block, has a lot of challenges ahead. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=156.27999999999997s)]
*  Do you think he's going to be able to keep these extreme right wingers at bay? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, it's a short term honeymoon, but it's more like a reprieve because he has the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=165.2s)]
*  main problems that have destroyed every other Republican speaker are still in place. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=171.16s)]
*  Right. I mean, you have you have a caucus that is not interested in governing, that is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=175.48s)]
*  prepared to burn things down. That has not changed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=180.32s)]
*  This is a very, very divided conference. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=183.16s)]
*  They still hate one another. All of the things that led to the the the ouster of the end [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=185.16s)]
*  of John Boehner's speakership, Paul Ryan's speakership. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=191.8s)]
*  You just run down the list of that. All of those things, all of those factors are still in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=195.8s)]
*  place. And this is still Donald Trump's party. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=200.24s)]
*  So he may have a few days. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=204.56s)]
*  He may have a little bit of elbow room. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  He is not going to have a tremendously long runway to be able to do a lot of things. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, clearly already on Ukraine, he's being squeezed. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=216.52s)]
*  But the fundamentals have not changed and they're not going to change. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  So, Charlie, let's get your assessment. You mentioned him on where things start for Donald Trump [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=224.12s)]
*  right now. He was spent some time in a New York courtroom this week. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=227.44s)]
*  He continues to try to clean up comments he made about Israel when that war began. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  He and so many of his opponents are heading to Las Vegas this weekend for the RJC. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=236.84s)]
*  Do you see anything at all that's changed the contours of this race? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  No, not so far. I mean, we've we've been this is again the same old same old. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=245.68s)]
*  I mean, he can he continues to put out absolutely deranged tweets. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=250.8s)]
*  He he pitches a fit in a courtroom. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=254.2s)]
*  He is sanctioned by a judge. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=257.0s)]
*  And yet nothing has moved the Republican electorate. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=259.6s)]
*  So we may have this this very brief moment in the House where Republicans have have, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=263.72s)]
*  you know, papered over their dysfunction. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=270.4s)]
*  But the but the dysfunction runs awfully deep and it starts right at the top. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=272.6s)]
*  And so, Charlie, so let's look ahead a little bit to next year, we assume, at least for now, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=278.0s)]
*  Trump comes out as the Republican nominee. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=281.8s)]
*  You know, any president they run for reelection, the health of the economy is so vital. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=284.24s)]
*  U.S. got a great GDP number yesterday, the White House taking some credit for that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=288.84s)]
*  Is that going to ease some of the anxiety that's sort of creeping up in Democrats [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=293.88s)]
*  as they look to the toward a potential Biden Trump rematch? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=298.04s)]
*  It'll only ease the anxiety when the poll numbers start to move. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=301.8s)]
*  There's clearly a disconnect between some of the economic numbers and the approval [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=305.16s)]
*  ratings of Joe Biden. For some reason, the American public is not willing to give him [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  credit, does not have confidence in him, and he's going to have to close that gap. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=313.6s)]
*  Now he's got time to do that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  There's often a a lagging lag between the time that the economic numbers come around [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=319.88s)]
*  and the vibes come into line with it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=326.48s)]
*  And that's that's the problem right now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=329.68s)]
*  So I don't expect that. And frankly, I think that there ought to be anxiety among [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  Democrats. I mean, when you look at at this political universe with Donald Trump [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=335.68s)]
*  facing 91 felony charges on a daily basis, reminding us how utterly unfit he is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=340.24s)]
*  for office. And yet there are indications that he is competitive nationally and also [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=346.16s)]
*  in the swing state. So if there's a time to be nervous, this is a time. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=351.16s)]
*  This is the time. All right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=354.6s)]
*  Founder of the conservative website, the Borg Charlie Sykes. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=356.36s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. Have a good weekend. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=359.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKnnlqN3Yts&t=365.68s)]
