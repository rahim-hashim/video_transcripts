# Biden's budget prioritizes working people, says House member
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs)
*  Welcome back. In what's shaping up to be a blistering battle over President Joe Biden's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=0.0s)]
*  recently proposed budget plan, the president is touting his administration's policies on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  lowering the cost of prescription drugs and helping those who depend on Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=10.32s)]
*  The president stressed that message in Las Vegas earlier this week, accusing Republicans [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=15.84s)]
*  to cut health care programs that help so many Americans. Republicans, on the other hand, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=20.2s)]
*  say the president's new budget would raise taxes and spending and contribute to a continued [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=24.68s)]
*  troublesome inflation. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Seth Magiziner of the Great State [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=30.56s)]
*  of Rhode Island. He's a member of the House Homeland Security Committee and former state [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=36.64s)]
*  treasurer. Congressman, good morning. Thanks for being with us today. I know you have a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=40.8s)]
*  lot of thoughts about the president's budget proposal, but we should be clear. This is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  more of a statement of priorities. It's more of a political exercise than a practical roadmap [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=50.2s)]
*  for spending. Since, of course, we've got divided government, Republicans control the House. But [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=55.720000000000006s)]
*  tell us, are there a few parts of the budget you could see Republicans joining? Are there areas [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  of potential common ground? Well, there are areas where there should be common ground. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  President Biden's budget is a budget that prioritizes working people by asking billionaires [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  to pay their fair share. His budget prioritizes lowering prescription drug costs, investing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=75.32s)]
*  in child care. If you want more Americans in the workforce, then invest in child care. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=81.08s)]
*  That's an area where there ought to be bipartisan support. And invest in affordable housing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=87.08s)]
*  as well, all without raising taxes over anyone making less than $400,000 a year. In contrast, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=90.88s)]
*  what we've seen on the Republican side is extremism. Kevin McCarthy handed the keys of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=98.08s)]
*  the House of Representatives over to the most extreme members of his party in order [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=104.24s)]
*  to become speaker. Those extreme members in the Freedom Caucus have released a budget [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=109.36s)]
*  that would make painful cuts in health care, in education funding, and other priorities [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=114.72s)]
*  that matter to working people. So you're right. I mean, we're in the posturing phase of the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  budget negotiations, but the difference could not be more clear. President Biden's budget [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=127.84s)]
*  that prioritizes the needs of working Americans and the Republicans are prioritizing the needs [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  of their donors, not everyday Americans. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=138.94s)]
*  So, Donald, speaking of working Americans, you've been very vocal about the PRO Act, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=141.88s)]
*  which you say would protect the rights of workers. Tell us a little bit about that now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=146.84s)]
*  How important is it? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=150.56s)]
*  Well, listen, it was unions that helped build the middle class in this country. That was [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  certainly true for my grandfather, who was a union steelworker and with that job was [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=156.26s)]
*  able to buy a house, put his kids through school, and earn a ticket to the middle class. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=160.9s)]
*  Over the last generation, as union membership has declined, wages have remained stagnant [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=166.66s)]
*  while corporate profits have gone up. So one of the reasons that that has happened is that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=173.18s)]
*  big companies have become savvier in finding ways to harass workers out of forming or joining [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=179.38s)]
*  unions. The PRO Act is a bipartisan bill, bipartisan, Republican and Democratic co-sponsors [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  that would toughen penalties against big corporations that engage in union-busting activities. Everyone [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=192.94s)]
*  should have the right to join a union. That's part of how we built the middle class in this [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=199.42s)]
*  country and it's how we will save the middle class ultimately. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=203.26s)]
*  Congressman, you mentioned the word bipartisan. There aren't too many areas of agreement right [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=205.94s)]
*  now, but one seems to be China. And you joined your colleagues on both sides of the aisle [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=210.38s)]
*  last week for a hearing on combating Chinese government espionage and intellectual property [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=215.18s)]
*  theft. So what's your greatest concern and tell us what can the Congress, what can the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  U.S. lawmakers do about it? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=224.82s)]
*  Well, let's be clear. First of all, our beef is not with the people of China. It is with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=227.06s)]
*  the Chinese authoritarian government that has set itself up to be America's greatest [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=232.9s)]
*  economic competitor. And they are engaging in state-sponsored corporate espionage that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=238.42s)]
*  is costing the American people billions of dollars a year, literally spying on American [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=244.86s)]
*  companies to steal their intellectual property and make the same goods illegally in China. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of things that we can do and should do. And I think you're right. This [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=257.02000000000004s)]
*  is an area that's ripe for bipartisanship. But the most important thing that we could do [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=260.22s)]
*  to improve our competitive standing vis-a-vis China is to invest in American manufacturing, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=264.94s)]
*  to make more stuff in America. We took a big step forward last year with the CHIPS Act, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=270.46s)]
*  which passed in a bipartisan vote, championed by President Biden to bring semiconductor [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=277.02s)]
*  manufacturing back to the United States. We should do more of that. More incentives to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=281.34s)]
*  manufacture, to make more in America is ultimately the most important thing we can do to compete [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=285.5s)]
*  with China going forward. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  And we'll be looking for more of those hearings in the weeks ahead. Congressman Seth [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=292.14s)]
*  Magazine, Irving Rhode Island, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bD8EjSmghs&t=295.82s)]
