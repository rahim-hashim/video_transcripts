# U.S. Congressional Committee sheds light on alleged genocide in China's Xinjiang region
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU)
*  A new House committee focused on China held its second hearing yesterday and highlighted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=0.0s)]
*  human rights abuses taking place in that country. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=4.9s)]
*  The panel heard from two women who experienced life in Chinese re-education camps for the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=8.34s)]
*  Uighurs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=14.06s)]
*  Human rights groups have accused Beijing of placing more than one million Uighurs and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=15.06s)]
*  other ethnic minorities in prison-like internment camps. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=19.92s)]
*  China has denied any accusations of wrongdoing, claiming the country established vocational [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  training centers to curb terrorism and religious radicalism. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=28.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports that Saudi Arabia and Syria are on the verge [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=32.4s)]
*  of restoring diplomatic ties by way of negotiations brokered by Russia. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=37.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Syria's relationship broke down in 2012 following the Arab Spring uprising [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=42.0s)]
*  that occurred throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=47.08s)]
*  Now the Journal reports a deal may be reached by late April and, if it is, a vote on Syria's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=48.84s)]
*  reintegration would be held during the Arab League Summit in the following month. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=54.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, some breaking news. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  Happening overnight, a drone strike on a coalition base in Syria killed a United States contractor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  Five U.S. military service members and a second contractor were also injured. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=67.32s)]
*  The drone strike just before 2 p.m. local time in northeast Syria. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=71.64s)]
*  U.S. intelligence believes the drone was of Iranian origin. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=75.4s)]
*  And in response, per the Pentagon, the U.S. launched airstrikes in eastern Syria on facilities [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=79.2s)]
*  used by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=84.26s)]
*  That's all according to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=88.94s)]
*  I'm certain we'll have more updates on this developing story as the day goes on. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=91.26s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jake Akincloss of Massachusetts. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=95.34s)]
*  He's a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and as well as the Select [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and China. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=104.5s)]
*  So let's start right there, that hearing yesterday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  And you heard about these human rights abuses, the gutting testimony from these two women. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  Just give us some of your takeaways and what can be done. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  It was the most painful testimony I've heard as a member of Congress. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  These two women survivors deserve incredible plaudits for their bravery in telling their [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  story and as one of two dozen Jewish members in Congress, I know too well the history of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=131.9s)]
*  genocide and the treatment that they described has all the hallmarks of that crime against [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=137.1s)]
*  humanity, the forced sterilization, the concentration camps, the separation between parents and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=143.74s)]
*  children, the euphemisms, the propaganda and the downright murder. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=148.34s)]
*  We need to do better in supporting institutions that bring to light these atrocities, including [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=156.42s)]
*  Radio Free Asia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=161.5s)]
*  We need to do better in garnering international condemnation. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=163.18s)]
*  I think it's worth noting that at the Human Rights Council of the United Nations, they [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  could not even vote to start debate on a draft discussion item about the Uyghur Massacre. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  It demonstrates the Chinese Communist Party's incredible efforts to keep this under wraps [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=179.38s)]
*  and the United States needs to bring it to light. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=185.74s)]
*  Yeah, as we were just discussing earlier in the show, it's a topic where there's real [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=187.34s)]
*  bipartisan energy here about China. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=190.66s)]
*  Let's switch to matters, a domestic matter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=193.94s)]
*  We were just talking earlier about how the bank failures that we've seen recently is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  putting renewed scrutiny on the economy and the fundamentals of it, but also ongoing negotiations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  about the budget and the debt ceiling, which could be so destabilizing to the economy if [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=206.18s)]
*  the deadlines even approach. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=211.26s)]
*  That's what so many economists say. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=212.8s)]
*  We've seen President Biden's budget. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=214.34s)]
*  The Republicans are at work on theirs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=216.34s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=218.18s)]
*  Just give us your sense of where things stand. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=219.26s)]
*  How concerned are you that we could be barreling towards that cliff? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=221.42s)]
*  I'm concerned. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=224.06s)]
*  Think about what happened during the bank runs. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=225.82s)]
*  Depositors, investors fled towards safety, as they tend to do. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  One of those safe assets they fled towards was the United States Treasury, which is considered [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=233.17999999999998s)]
*  the riskless asset in our financial services system. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=236.98s)]
*  Well, if the United States defaults on its debt, that is no longer a riskless asset, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=239.7s)]
*  and the entire financial order is upended. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=244.14s)]
*  That means the United States' stature on the world stage. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=246.66s)]
*  That means the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency, and that means the retirement [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=249.12s)]
*  accounts of tens of millions of Americans. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=253.16s)]
*  And Democrats have been quite clear. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=255.76s)]
*  You cannot hold hostage the full faith and credit of the United States. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=257.64s)]
*  We need to have a clean debt limit raise, and we are happy to then do the tough work [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=261.08s)]
*  of negotiating on the budget. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=265.68s)]
*  The GOP has said that they don't want to pay our bills on time, but they don't have a plan [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=267.52s)]
*  for how they actually do want to pay our bills and what bills they think are important in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=272.44s)]
*  the first place. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=276.48s)]
*  They have no budget and they have no plan. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=277.48s)]
*  So real quick, are there some Republicans, though, that you think could be reaching convinced [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=278.48s)]
*  of that argument that could vote perhaps against what Speaker McCarthy wants? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=281.68s)]
*  Yes, I mean, we're going to have to do that to get this past the House. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=284.88s)]
*  We need Republican support to do the right thing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you feel like there's any movement there? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=290.0s)]
*  I think the GOP needs to put forward its budget so that they have their own plans and priorities. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=292.36s)]
*  Budgets are statements of priorities. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  The president has put forward his statement of priorities that talks about lowering drug [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=298.82s)]
*  prices, that talks about putting Medicare on a path to solvency, that talks about continuing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=302.68s)]
*  to invest in our infrastructure. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  What are the Republican priorities? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=308.28s)]
*  Yeah, this is going to be a dominant storyline here in D.C. in the weeks ahead. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=309.28s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Jake Achenklaas of the Greatest State Union, Massachusetts, GO Bruins, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  thank you for being here this morning. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=338.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu96sz53JdU&t=339.28s)]
