# Rep. Stefanik: I would not have done what Pence did
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ)
*  Republican Congressman Elise Stefanik, who has been floated as Donald Trump's possible [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  2024 presidential, vice presidential pick, said last night that she would have acted [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=5.74s)]
*  differently than Mike Pence on January 6th, 2021, when he refused to do Trump's bidding [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=10.98s)]
*  and went ahead and certified 20 election results. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=17.54s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=21.06s)]
*  I would not have done what Mike Pence did. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=23.06s)]
*  I don't think that was the right approach. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=25.38s)]
*  I specifically stand by what I said on the House floor, and I stand by my statement, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=26.78s)]
*  which was there was unconstitutional overreach. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=32.22s)]
*  There was unconstitutional overreach in states like Pennsylvania, and I think it's very important [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=34.42s)]
*  that we continue to stand up for the Constitution and have legal and secure elections, which [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=40.06s)]
*  we did not have in 2020. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=43.78s)]
*  And tens of millions of Americans agree with me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=45.86s)]
*  Joining us now, communications strategist and former aid to House speakers Ryan and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=50.3s)]
*  Boehner, Brandon Buck. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=54.3s)]
*  He is an MSNBC political analyst. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=55.66s)]
*  Brandon, let's get your reaction to what we just heard from Elise Stefanik there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=58.82s)]
*  It seems like a litmus test in some ways that right now to be considered to be Donald Trump's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=63.81999999999999s)]
*  vice president, you have to disavow everything that he opposed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=68.74s)]
*  And that included Mike Pence, who did the right thing, who followed his constitutional [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  duty on January 6th and had his life threatened for doing it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=79.06s)]
*  Elise Stefanik said he was wrong. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=83.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's clearly a tryout for BP. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  There's no real reason for her to do an interview like that other than to show Donald Trump [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  that if she's chosen, she'll go out there and defend it to the end, just in the way [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=92.14s)]
*  that Mike Pence did, frankly, for most of his vice presidency. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=96.3s)]
*  Look, I've known Elise Stefanik for a very long time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=100.5s)]
*  She was actually on the Romney presidential campaign, and we worked together on the Paul [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=103.5s)]
*  Ryan VP team. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=106.82s)]
*  She's smart. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=109.5s)]
*  She knows what she's doing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=110.5s)]
*  We all recall her time in the House the first few years that she was there when she was [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=112.14s)]
*  a moderate, middle of the road member. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=116.66s)]
*  And that's because that's what her district was more like back then. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=119.94s)]
*  And as her district became Trumpier, she saw the writing on the wall and she became a different [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=123.38s)]
*  person. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=127.86s)]
*  So she is very good at playing the political role that she thinks she needs to for that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  moment. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=133.85999999999999s)]
*  And that's clearly what's going on here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  She'll say what she needs to do if it means she could potentially be the vice president [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  I think it is really dangerous that this is the place that we have come, that you have [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=142.14s)]
*  to reject reality as a basic litmus test. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=146.82s)]
*  But you're right, that's what this is. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  And anybody who even has sniffed the idea of criticizing Donald Trump has no place, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=152.66s)]
*  particularly in a second term, where he's going to be much more emboldened. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=158.5s)]
*  So I think Stefanik is sort of an embodiment of this trend among Republicans, that they [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  will just simply do whatever Donald Trump wants. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=166.98s)]
*  His grip on the GOP has only gotten tighter. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=168.9s)]
*  And that also was on his full display this week in Congress. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=171.98s)]
*  So, Brendan, why don't you weigh in here as to what you saw with the downfall of the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=175.02s)]
*  border security foreign aid bill and if you think there's any scenario where this standalone [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=180.18s)]
*  bill can get through the Senate and the House. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=184.7s)]
*  Well, I'll give you the optimistic, I actually do think that a standalone Ukraine-Israel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=187.54s)]
*  become law and there's a very decent chance that that could happen. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=192.78s)]
*  Look, Donald Trump certainly was not helpful with the immigration debate. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=196.46s)]
*  But I think that immigration bill was almost dead from the beginning, with or without Donald [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=201.18s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  They're not unrelated. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump became the leader of the party because the party has become so nativist, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  so populist, so anti-immigrant, and Donald Trump took advantage of that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=213.1s)]
*  We've not been able to get anything done on immigration for years and years and years [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=216.86s)]
*  because of those realities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  And Donald Trump spoke to those realities. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  So Donald Trump certainly didn't help the situation. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=226.22s)]
*  But I think as much as anything, it's the voters who reject that kind of thing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  It's the activists in the party who don't want that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=234.61999999999998s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been speaking to those a lot more, frankly, than some of the establishment [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=237.26s)]
*  voices that I worked for did on this particular issue. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=240.7s)]
*  And lastly, Brendan, we noted a little while ago, Donald Trump wins the caucuses in Nevada, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=243.61999999999998s)]
*  and we've been very pleased to see that he's been picked for him in one other smaller contest as well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=249.7s)]
*  You know, Nikki Haley is coming up on her last stand, we think, South Carolina, Michigan, Super Tuesday. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=253.7s)]
*  Do you see anything, any movement here at all where she could do well enough to stay in this race, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=259.7s)]
*  continue to be a thorn in his side? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think the only real determining factor there is if there are enough people with a lot of money [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  who want to make sure that she damages him enough for a general election. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=270.58s)]
*  I think everybody recognizes that this race is over. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=275.06s)]
*  It was probably over before Iowa and New Hampshire. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=278.5s)]
*  A campaign's end when they run out of money or a candidate simply doesn't want to put up with the embarrassment of losing anymore. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=281.94s)]
*  To her credit, she seems pretty dug in and wants to have this fight. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=288.66s)]
*  The problem is she seated this person 50 points in the polls and a whole year of campaigning before she decided she wanted to do that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=292.66s)]
*  And that's not a very effective strategy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=299.06s)]
*  So there may be a few billionaires out there who want to see her continue doing this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=300.74s)]
*  But obviously, like Elise Stefanik, everyone else is moving on to figuring out who the VP is going to be. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=304.82s)]
*  Yeah, terrific. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=310.26s)]
*  Inside as always, MSNBC political analyst, Brendan Buck. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=311.29999999999995s)]
*  Brendan, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdEdss8BLRQ&t=313.94s)]
