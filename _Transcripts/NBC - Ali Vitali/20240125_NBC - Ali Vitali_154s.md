# Biden set to announce $5B infrastructure investment in Wisconsin
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0)
*  President Joe Biden will head to Wisconsin today to announce nearly $5 billion to fund major infrastructure projects nationwide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=0.0s)]
*  That includes $1 billion to replace the Blackneck Bridge that connects Duluth, Minnesota to the town of Superior, Wisconsin. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=8.0s)]
*  The bridge transports more than 30,000 cars every day and is a key link to one of the largest Great Lakes ports. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=16.0s)]
*  Without the federal investment, officials say the bridge would have to close by 2030. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=23.0s)]
*  In a call to reporters, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg praised the investment saying, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=29.0s)]
*  what many of these pieces of transportation infrastructure have in common is that they are so large and so complex that building them or repairing them is not possible without dedicated funding. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=34.0s)]
*  Joining us now, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Olivia Dalton. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=46.0s)]
*  Olivia, thanks for joining us this morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=51.0s)]
*  So let's start there with infrastructure. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=54.0s)]
*  This is obviously a signature accomplishment of this president. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=56.0s)]
*  He likes to poke fun at his predecessor's infrastructure weeks and note how much more he is getting done. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=59.0s)]
*  But talk to us about this, the timeline. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=65.0s)]
*  We're going to see these funds go out to the states for projects like these and others. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=67.0s)]
*  When will the cash be in hand and shovels be in the ground? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=73.0s)]
*  Well, that's exactly what the president is headed out to Wisconsin to talk about today. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=76.0s)]
*  You just talked about what a vital economic corridor this Blackneck Bridge is. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=80.0s)]
*  And this is a great full circle moment for the president. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=84.0s)]
*  He first visited this bridge a couple of years ago after his State of the Union address to highlight the kind of investment we needed to see through the bipartisan infrastructure law that he passed in order to make sure that the United States is positioned to compete and win on the global stage in the decades ahead. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=86.0s)]
*  This bridge was slated to be out of commission by 2030 because it was so dilapidated and was no longer able to support the sort of infrastructure and the trucks that needed to move across this bridge. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=103.0s)]
*  And as a result of the funds that the president is announcing today, we're going to see shovels in the ground. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=117.0s)]
*  We're going to see this entire bridge replaced and support the billions of dollars in commerce that flow across this bridge each year to nearly every state in the United States. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=123.0s)]
*  And Canada. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwY17BJRaG0&t=132.0s)]
