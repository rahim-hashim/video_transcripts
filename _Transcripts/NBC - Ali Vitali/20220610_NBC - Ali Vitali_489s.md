# Committee Presents Graphic New Video And Evidence
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM)
*  According to video shown during last night's blockbuster January 6th committee hearing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=0.0s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley testified that it was Vice President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=5.44s)]
*  Mike Pence and not President Trump who ordered National Guard troops to respond to the attack [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=9.82s)]
*  on the Capitol. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=15.38s)]
*  There were two or three calls with Vice President Pence. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=16.38s)]
*  He was very animated and he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=20.66s)]
*  There was no question about that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=29.58s)]
*  I can get you the exact quotes I guess from some of our records somewhere, but he was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=33.26s)]
*  very animated, very direct, very firm to Secretary Milley. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=38.18s)]
*  Get the military down here, get the Guard down here, push down his situation, etc. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=44.18s)]
*  By contrast, here is General Milley's description of his conversation with President Trump's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=51.459999999999994s)]
*  Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on January 6th. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  He said, we have to kill the narrative that the Vice President is making all the decisions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=63.3s)]
*  We need to establish the narrative that the President is still in charge and that things [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=72.46s)]
*  are steady or stable towards that thing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=83.05999999999999s)]
*  I immediately interpret that as politics, politics, politics, red flag for me personally, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=85.46s)]
*  no action, but I remember it distinctly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  Also revealed last night that several Republican members of Congress, including Pennsylvania [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=94.82s)]
*  Republican Scott Perry, allegedly reached out to the Trump White House asking for pardons [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=99.3s)]
*  for their role in attempting to overturn the election. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=105.06s)]
*  That bombshell was also dropped by Congresswoman Cheney during the hearing last night. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=108.58s)]
*  Representative Scott Perry, who is also involved in trying to get Clark appointed as Attorney [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=115.22s)]
*  General, has refused to testify here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=119.86s)]
*  As you will see, Representative Perry contacted the White House in the weeks after January [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=123.54s)]
*  6th to seek a presidential pardon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=129.22s)]
*  Multiple other Republican congressmen also sought presidential pardons for their roles [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=138.02s)]
*  Cheney said Congressman Perry helped introduce then-President Trump to a Justice Department [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=141.78s)]
*  attorney who would help push the election fraud conspiracy theory. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=147.06s)]
*  A spokesman for Congressman Perry called the allegation, quote, a ludicrous and soulless [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=150.98s)]
*  lie. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=156.06s)]
*  Joining us now, congressional reporter for The Guardian, Hugo Lowell, who has been one [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=157.06s)]
*  of the top reporters on the January 6th committee from its inception. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=161.38s)]
*  Hugo, good morning. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=165.06s)]
*  Some of the major moments from last night, your paper wrote it this way. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=166.98s)]
*  The January 6th hearing hard hitting evidence puts Trump at heart of an assault on democracy [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=172.22s)]
*  as it happened. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=178.42s)]
*  Give us your assessment of last night. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=180.1s)]
*  What were the hardest hitting moments and did the committee do what it set out to do, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  which was establish and tell a powerful narrative of that day? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, I think there were two things that really stuck out to me and one of those [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=190.82s)]
*  things was definitely the pardons being requested by people like Scott Perry and other Republicans. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  We didn't get the full list of Republicans who are seeking pardons. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=200.54s)]
*  But I'm sorry, but there's just no way you're asking for pardons without a consciousness [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  of guilt. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=208.5s)]
*  That just doesn't work that way. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=209.9s)]
*  You're only asking for a pardon when you think you've done something wrong or if you think [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=210.9s)]
*  you have some legal exposure. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=214.86s)]
*  So that just doesn't add up that you are asking for a pardon, but you also thought you are [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=216.3s)]
*  somehow innocent. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=221.22s)]
*  So that was the first thing that stood out to me. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=222.22s)]
*  And there might be some potential legal exposure there for some of the Republican members of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=223.74s)]
*  Congress. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=228.46s)]
*  The second thing that stood out to me, though, was this committee really going after this [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=229.46s)]
*  concept of willful blindness. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=232.18s)]
*  And I think it's really important because the committee was showing by having a former [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=234.54s)]
*  Attorney General Bill Barr, by having his own daughter Ivanka Trump, talk about the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=239.22s)]
*  fact that the election was not stolen, that the claims that Donald Trump was putting out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=244.54s)]
*  there were nonsense. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=251.34s)]
*  And by saying that, they're basically making the case that Trump engaged in willful blindness, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=253.14s)]
*  the doctrine that if you're credibly informed that something is not the case, then you can't [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=260.14s)]
*  use that as a legal defense to say, oh, I didn't know about it, and use that to perpetuate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=266.42s)]
*  what turned out to be potential crimes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=271.7s)]
*  So those are the two things that really stood out to me. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=273.94s)]
*  Whether or not it cut through to the American public, I think we have to wait and see. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=275.66s)]
*  I don't think this is something that you can measure in ratings on the night. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=279.18s)]
*  Some of these clips are circulating around social media. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=282.98s)]
*  They're racking up a very high number of views. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think some of the footage from the Capitol attack itself of the Proud Boys storming the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=289.1s)]
*  Capitol, breaching the police lines, really compelling, really powerful video. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=294.84s)]
*  So I think we have to wait to see how the American public perceives that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, certainly the testimony was revealing, but it was this video last night. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=303.0s)]
*  We're seeing a little bit of it now, Hugo, that was the most powerful and extraordinary [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=308.56s)]
*  timeline of what happened that day. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=312.44s)]
*  Some really violent moments, threats put out there by these protesters, these insurrectionists [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=314.26s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi towards Vice President Pence. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=321.72s)]
*  Give us a sense as to what happens next in terms of last night, the committee certainly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  a big first statement. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=330.0s)]
*  How is the hearings going to play out going forward? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=331.88000000000005s)]
*  Well I think it was really the Liz Cheney show last night, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=335.32000000000005s)]
*  It was the vice chair, Liz Cheney, who laid out this multi-step process that Trump went [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=337.92s)]
*  through, this multi-step strategy that Trump had to overturn the election. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  And she said in the hearing last night that you're going to see us play this out over [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=348.08s)]
*  the course of the next few hearings. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=351.64s)]
*  The next hearings are going to be next week on Monday and then on Wednesday. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  And those are the next two that have been noticed. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  And we're going to see how this effort developed, how Trump perpetuated the lie to his supporters [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=360.96s)]
*  that the election was stolen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  And then the hearing after that, they will talk about how he tried to install deputies [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=368.29999999999995s)]
*  at the DOJ who are loyal to him. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=373.08s)]
*  People like Jeff Clark, he dangled the attorney general job before him because he seemed to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=375.82s)]
*  support the claim that there was election fraud and that he would use and weaponize [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  the Justice Department to investigate those claims. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=385.5s)]
*  So those are the next two ones that we are looking out for. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=388.46s)]
*  Down the line of course, we're also going to see how Trump pressured Vice President [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=391.06s)]
*  Pence to carry out his will on January 6th, how Pence refused. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=395.74s)]
*  And then at the very, very end, we're going to see this blockbuster, according to the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=398.84s)]
*  about how the White House and White House staffers tried to get Trump to call off the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=403.26s)]
*  violence and Trump did nothing. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=408.78s)]
*  And that again is another point of potential legal exposure for the former president. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=411.18s)]
*  This whole concept of corrupt intent and whether through inaction he obstructed a congressional [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=414.94s)]
*  proceeding. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=420.06s)]
*  And certainly, Hugo, we heard from witnesses last night, including a documentary filmmaker [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=421.06s)]
*  and the Capitol police officer who we opened the show with. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=425.46s)]
*  The two witnesses scheduled or could testify before this is out include Georgia Secretary [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=428.66s)]
*  of State Brad Raffensperger as well as close aides to the vice president. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=432.18s)]
*  Hugo Lowell, we really appreciate you being with us this morning. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=435.3s)]
*  We certainly will talk to you again next week as the hearings roll on. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=438.42s)]
*  As way too early continues, we're going to talk more about the blockbuster hearings last [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=442.06s)]
*  night. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=446.1s)]
*  And coming up on Morning Joe, we're going to hear from a top White House economic adviser [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=447.1s)]
*  after the latest consumer price index was released. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=450.86s)]
*  And of course, Morning Joe will also have far more from last night's hearing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=453.90000000000003s)]
*  A member of the January 6th committee, Congressman Jamie Raskin is among our guests. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  Morning, Joe. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=462.86s)]
*  A few moments away. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=463.86s)]
*  Way too early. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=464.86s)]
*  Right back. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpV3P2H5RNM&t=465.86s)]
