# Biden campaign raised $53M in February
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE)
*  President Biden's re-election campaign announced its biggest fundraising month yet since first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=0.0s)]
*  launching back last April, as they raised $53 million in February. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=5.96s)]
*  The president's campaign and its affiliated PAC say they have $155 million in the bank [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=11.26s)]
*  to spend. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=16.78s)]
*  That's up from $130 million in January. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=17.78s)]
*  The Trump campaign has not yet released its fundraising figures for February, but is expected [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  to be at a significant disadvantage. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now, White House reporter for Bloomberg News, our friend Jordan Fabian. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=28.8s)]
*  Jordan, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=32.6s)]
*  So let's talk about the cash game. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=33.88s)]
*  As mentioned, we don't have solid numbers yet from the Republican side, but we believe [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=36.88s)]
*  that President Biden's team will be well up and have a significant advantage. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Tell us why they think they were so successful raising money and how are they going to exploit [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=45.3s)]
*  the campaign, the cash advantage? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=49.96s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on, Jonathan. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  And look, there were two big events last month. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=54.8s)]
*  You had the State of the Union and Super Tuesday, which were rallying points for Democrats, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=57.16s)]
*  particularly on Super Tuesday. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=62.16s)]
*  The Biden campaign said they had a big bump on appeals based on Trump clinching the Republican [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  nomination. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=69.36s)]
*  So that tells you about how they're going to run this campaign, which is a choice election [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=70.36s)]
*  between Biden and Trump, trying to get it off of the theme of a referendum on Biden. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=74.16s)]
*  And look, this cash advantage is going to provide crucial for the Biden campaign. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=79.6s)]
*  They can run ads. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=84.0s)]
*  They can staff up in battleground states. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=85.28s)]
*  And the Trump campaign is going to be running from behind on that front. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=87.36s)]
*  Yeah, really striking. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=89.88s)]
*  Last week, the president was in Wisconsin and they announced his team announced they [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=90.88s)]
*  like 40 something campaign offices open in that state. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=93.76s)]
*  The Republicans don't have any. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=96.48s)]
*  And that's added to the sense that Biden has some momentum right now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=98.44s)]
*  We haven't really seen the polls change, to be clear. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=101.56s)]
*  But Democrats are feeling good, the president himself feeling good, and not just because [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  it was St. Patrick's Day, which is his favorite day on the calendar. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=107.44s)]
*  We heard from him address the age issue head on again with some humor at the gridiron dinner. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=110.7s)]
*  This weekend, no cameras allowed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=116.0s)]
*  But Jordan, tell us a little bit more about how the president and his team are trying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=117.6s)]
*  to navigate what is a poll suggest is an obstacle. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=121.16s)]
*  Look, this is, I would say, the biggest obstacle for President Biden heading into the election. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=124.36s)]
*  And the first big swing you saw him take was the State of the Union. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=131.24s)]
*  You saw the energy, the you know, you're speaking very loudly. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=135.24s)]
*  He was pretty on point for throughout the hour that that speech lasted. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=138.76s)]
*  And his campaign advisers have wanted him to take on this question with humor. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=143.17999999999998s)]
*  And that's what you saw at the gridiron. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=148.77999999999997s)]
*  And you know, Democrats I talked to just want to see Joe Biden get out there more, get out [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=150.61999999999998s)]
*  of this cocoon that some of the White House staff have built for him, get out on the road [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=154.5s)]
*  and show voters that he is up to the task. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=158.61999999999998s)]
*  That's the only way they believe they're going to break through. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=162.14s)]
*  And so you have seen the president keep up this pretty heavy cadence to travel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=164.38s)]
*  He's going to be doing that this week on the West Coast, going to Nevada, Arizona, down [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=168.94s)]
*  to Texas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=173.7s)]
*  So look out for how he's going to be handling this issue going forward. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=174.7s)]
*  And you're seeing the early stages right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=179.66s)]
*  Yeah, Jordan, you took me exactly where I want to go next. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=181.5s)]
*  Preview us a little more, if you will, what he hopes to do on this West Coast swing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=183.98s)]
*  It seems like it's a mix of some official events to talk about his accomplishments, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=187.7s)]
*  but also fundraising, continuing to press that cash advantage. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=191.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=196.26s)]
*  So one of the reasons a Democratic president is stopping in Texas, if not for that reason. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  But yeah, look in Nevada and Arizona, these are two crucial battleground states, states [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=200.54s)]
*  that are expected to be pretty close. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=206.66s)]
*  Nevada in particular is a must win for Joe Biden, a state heavy with Latino voters, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=208.54s)]
*  union voters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=214.54s)]
*  Campaign aides tell me they're actually they're concentrating very heavily on black voters [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=216.1s)]
*  there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=219.34s)]
*  So look for him to get out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=220.34s)]
*  He's going to be in Reno and Las Vegas and speak to those communities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=221.34s)]
*  It's going to be a turnout election. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  He needs those core constituent groups to show up in November. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=226.42s)]
*  And so he's looking to mobilize them now. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  Jordan, let's talk about the contrast he's trying to draw with the Republicans who occupied [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=232.22s)]
*  the building behind you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=236.33999999999997s)]
*  We know that there's another government shutdown potentially looming. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=238.5s)]
*  Tell us how White House aides are viewing that possibility, but also what we've seen [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=241.88s)]
*  is a far more aggressive stance from them and the council's office trying to shut down [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=245.77999999999997s)]
*  the Republicans impeachment inquiry into the president. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=251.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think the White House has become pretty sanguine on the shutdown threat after the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=255.06s)]
*  first trench of government funding was passed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=259.18s)]
*  I think that that fear is abating, even though there are some tie ups right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=261.54s)]
*  But they are trying to draw a contrast right now with Republicans on the Hill. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=265.06s)]
*  You know, basically the Harry Truman playbook of running against a do nothing Congress as [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=269.1s)]
*  an unpopular president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=274.18s)]
*  So you know, hitting in them on the impeachment front and especially also Jonathan on the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=275.5s)]
*  stalled emergency aid package for Ukraine, Israel, an Asian Pacific allies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=279.98s)]
*  They're hitting them every day on that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  Jake Sullivan is going to be in the briefing room today at the White House. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=287.62s)]
*  Look for him to hit Republicans on that as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=290.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's extremely important here is that the White House still pushing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=293.18s)]
*  for that aid to Ukraine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=298.36s)]
*  The president said that again when he was with the Irish T shock, the prime minister [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=301.06s)]
*  this weekend and suggesting with Putin now newly reelected and we put that word in quotes [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=306.42s)]
*  that this is a threat that's not going to go away anytime soon. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=312.3s)]
*  White House reporter for Bloomberg News Jordan Fabian. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=315.98s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDOoo7vs0DE&t=318.78000000000003s)]
