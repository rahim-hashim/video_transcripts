# Trump Campaign Requests Second Georgia Recount | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=0.0s)]
*  The Trump campaign has requested that Georgia perform another recount of the presidential [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=4.24s)]
*  election results. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=9.18s)]
*  The request came just one day after the state certified the outcome of a hand recount of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=10.46s)]
*  the nearly five million ballots cast, which solidified Joe Biden's win. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=15.72s)]
*  Campaigns can request an additional machine recount if a vote margin is within half a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=21.32s)]
*  percentage point. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=25.8s)]
*  The final certified results had Biden ahead by a margin of point two six percent, roughly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=27.34s)]
*  12000 votes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=32.3s)]
*  Unlike in other states, the hefty recount bill is footed by the Georgia taxpayers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=34.46s)]
*  Joining us now, political reporter for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Greg Blustein. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=40.74s)]
*  Greg, good morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=44.66s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=45.74s)]
*  As I as I know, it has been said about you on Morning Joe. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=47.28s)]
*  There's no one that I would rather talk to about what's happening down in Georgia, which [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=51.22s)]
*  is going to be really the center of our political universe this year, but probably also many [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=55.34s)]
*  years into the future. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=59.94s)]
*  So thank you for getting up early with us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=61.06s)]
*  This recount request, what Trump Trump's campaign is doing here, it's taking place against the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=64.06s)]
*  backdrop also of two Senate races that are going to decide who controls the chamber. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=70.58s)]
*  My question for you is, what do Republicans who are focused on those races, Mitch McConnell [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=77.62s)]
*  others who know that's the future, how does that play into what Donald Trump is continuing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=83.44s)]
*  to do, trying to continue to call the presidential race results into question over and over again [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=89.6s)]
*  and demanding that the taxpayers pay up for it? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=94.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, they're worried this is a distraction. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=99.2s)]
*  They're worried that all these false claims of fraudulent voting and irregularities will [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=102.66s)]
*  end up depriving Republicans of one of their best arguments, which is which is that Senate [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=107.06s)]
*  control, Republican Senate control is a check on Joe Biden because they can't acknowledge [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=113.18s)]
*  that it's a check on Joe Biden yet because they have acknowledged Joe Biden's victory [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=118.34s)]
*  yet. And secondly, they worry that it could it could depress turnout. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=122.06s)]
*  That it could be the equivalent of a wet blanket on Republican turnout at a time where they [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  need every single vote they can because Georgia is newly competitive. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=129.06s)]
*  So, Greg, the conventional wisdom in these kinds of runoffs has always has typically [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=133.76s)]
*  been anyway, and this isn't just in Georgia, but across the country, in fact, that when [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=138.72s)]
*  you have a special election, you know, it's frequent voters who are more likely to show [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=144.72s)]
*  up. That oftentimes is the Republican base. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=148.88s)]
*  And I don't mean the Trump base. I mean the traditional Republican base, people who vote [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=152.0s)]
*  in primaries with regularity. There's always been this assumption that Democrats show up [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=155.64s)]
*  more more regularly, only in the Senate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  More more regularly, only in presidential years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=161.82s)]
*  So that would seem to advantage the GOP in in these two contests. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=164.78s)]
*  But it all seems very uncertain and up in the air. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=169.02s)]
*  And I'm wondering what your assumptions are going into these runoffs about how they're [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=171.9s)]
*  going to play out. Do you think Purdue and Loeffler go in with an advantage over Warnock [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=177.1s)]
*  and and Ossoff? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=183.34s)]
*  Or do you think that we should be making a different set of assumptions in these races? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=185.06s)]
*  Look, I think that Republicans have a historical advantage in a state like Georgia. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=190.32s)]
*  They've won every statewide runoff in Georgia history. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  But this is an election like no other. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=197.48s)]
*  So I think all assumptions have to be thrown out because a Democrat just showed they have a path to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=199.68s)]
*  statewide victory in Georgia. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=204.48s)]
*  That was their Democrats hadn't won the state of Georgia in the presidential race since [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=205.96s)]
*  92 and not a statewide election since 2006. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=210.12s)]
*  So they they forged a path. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=213.84s)]
*  They showed they have a pathway to success. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=215.56s)]
*  And secondly, yes, the electorate in these in these runoffs tend to be older and whiter, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  which tends to help Republicans. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  But you've also had never never had an election with such high stakes, never had an election like [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=225.18s)]
*  this with an African-American candidate, Raphael Warnock at the top of the ballot, who Democrats [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  hope can really energize black voters who who don't turn out in as high proportions of these [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=233.46s)]
*  runoffs as they do general elections. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=238.46s)]
*  You know, great points all. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=242.86s)]
*  And of course, Kelly Loeffler over the weekend testing positive for covid and we're waiting on [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=244.16s)]
*  results from Senator Perdue as well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=249.48s)]
*  The Atlanta Journal Constitution's Greg Lucine, thank you so much for getting up early with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=251.88s)]
*  We hope it wasn't too painful and that you'll come back at some point soon. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=255.64s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eugORb_XoI&t=258.76s)]
