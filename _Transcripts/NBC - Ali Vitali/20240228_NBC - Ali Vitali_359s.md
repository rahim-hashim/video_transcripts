# Nikki Haley criticizes Trump, rallies supporters in Colorado
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg)
*  The first thing I want to talk about is, you know, we're going to talk about the state of Colorado, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=0.0s)]
*  because the reason I'm concerned is I came from Michigan, where in 2012 they were a beacon of light. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=5.0s)]
*  They were winning races up and down the ticket. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=14.0s)]
*  And when I was there this week, they've lost the governor's mansion, they've lost the state house, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=18.0s)]
*  they've lost the state senate since Donald Trump was president. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=23.0s)]
*  Then we went to Minnesota. Same thing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=28.0s)]
*  They lost the governor's mansion, they don't have the state house, they don't have the state senate, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=32.0s)]
*  and they're feeling everything go the other way. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=36.0s)]
*  Now I'm in Colorado, and I'm looking at the fact that no Republican has gotten over 45% statewide since Donald Trump was president. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=40.0s)]
*  The truth of the matter is, chaos follows him. Everywhere he goes, chaos follows him. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=52.0s)]
*  And we can't be a country in disarray and a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We wouldn't survive it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=62.0s)]
*  That was Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley going after former President Trump in Colorado yesterday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=69.0s)]
*  She prepares to visit multiple Super Tuesday states ahead of next week's big day at the ballot box. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=75.0s)]
*  Joining us now, national politics reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=82.0s)]
*  Julia, good to see you this morning. Let's start with last night in Michigan. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=87.0s)]
*  As we just covered with Charlie Sykes, there seem to be warning signs for both Biden and Trump, despite decisive victories. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=92.0s)]
*  Give us your read on both races and the analysis of some sharp political operatives you've been speaking to. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=99.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jonathan, certainly good nights for Biden and Trump seemingly on track to win their respective nominations, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=105.0s)]
*  but there are still warning signs, you know, for President Biden in Michigan when you have a large Arab American population voting uncommitted or voicing their discontent with the president's handling of the war between Israel and Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=112.0s)]
*  That's a big warning sign going into 2024, whether it's with Arab American voters or even younger voters, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=126.0s)]
*  Gen Z voters who are unhappy with the president's handling of the war just shows how this foreign policy issue was really seeping in to this domestic election, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=133.0s)]
*  how it could impact Biden and Biden's every move in this war is going to be essentially played out on the campaign trail in some way with voters for former President Trump. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=144.0s)]
*  We're continuing to see those warning signs with some more moderate Republican voters or a minority of Republican primary voters who are upset with the prospect of him winning the nomination. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=154.0s)]
*  Now, is it enough for President, former President Trump not to get the nomination? No, he's on track to win that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=167.0s)]
*  However, what in what's slated to be a really tight election, every vote for both of these candidates matter. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=173.0s)]
*  So any slip up or any issue with voters with a voting block, a voting group is going to matter in the total going into November, assuming they are both the respective party's nominees. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like so telling out of some of the polling that a significant percentage of those who vote for Haley say, look, we just simply won't vote for Trump. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=192.0s)]
*  Some of them may come home between now and November, but a lot won't. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=201.0s)]
*  And if they don't, how worrisome is that for the former president? It is worrisome. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=206.0s)]
*  That being said, though, a lot of Republicans, Republican operatives, I speak to say, look, once you know, the it's a done deal for both of these nominations, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=211.0s)]
*  assuming it's Trump and Biden and they are officially the nominees that period between the conventions in July and August and November, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=222.0s)]
*  it will start to sink in for voters and that they are going to see this choice, whether they like it or not, that it's between Trump and President Biden. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=230.0s)]
*  And they will have to make a decision. And looking at the other side of the political spectrum, wherever they may be, if they're forced to choose between these two men, they're going to choose. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=238.0s)]
*  So, you know, they seem to think that ultimately these Republicans will come home. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=248.0s)]
*  But, you know, for me, it's not necessarily the Republican primary voters, Jonathan, it's these independent swing voters in areas like the suburbs and the suburbs of Philadelphia, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=253.0s)]
*  for example, the suburbs of Detroit, some of these big cities in the U.S. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=263.0s)]
*  Where we've seen suburban voters, particularly suburban independent women, really decide a lot of the recent elections. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=268.0s)]
*  They've swung towards Democrats recently. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=275.0s)]
*  But, you know, depending on what happens going forward with the economy or a number of other issues, they could swing back towards Republicans. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=278.0s)]
*  And, you know, let's now return to Nikki Haley, who opened this segment with the litany of losing that's followed Republicans since Donald Trump became the force of their of their party. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=286.0s)]
*  Super Tuesday, she said she's staying in. That's now just six days away. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=296.0s)]
*  Quick two-parter. Do you think there's any of those states on Super Tuesday that she could actually win? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=300.0s)]
*  And if the answer is no, does she stay in beyond that? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=304.0s)]
*  It's hard to see her winning any of these states outright. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=307.0s)]
*  If she does do particularly well in some of these states, maybe not exactly winning, you know, that could mean she stays in. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=311.0s)]
*  It all has to do with the funding and how much she's bringing in, whether it's from fundraising or donors. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=318.0s)]
*  I think losing the Coke-backed Americans for prosperity isn't a good sign. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=323.0s)]
*  However, her campaign is continuing to fundraise. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=328.0s)]
*  All right. National Politics Reporter for The Hill, Julia Manchester. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=331.0s)]
*  We appreciate your analysis. Thank you so very much. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=335.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7UDzsW08pg&t=353.0s)]
