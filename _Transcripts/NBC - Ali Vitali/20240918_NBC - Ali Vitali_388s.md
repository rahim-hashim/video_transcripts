# Harris says she's going to 'earn the vote' of Black men
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg)
*  Vice President Kamala Harris is making a renewed pitch to a key voting bloc, Young Black Men. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the vice president laid out how her economic plan can help that community during [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists held in Philadelphia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=10.48s)]
*  It comes as polls show that Donald Trump has gained some ground with that group. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I think it's very important to not [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=21.2s)]
*  operate from the assumption that black men are in anybody's pocket. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=24.24s)]
*  Black men are like any other voting group. You gotta earn their vote. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=29.04s)]
*  So I'm working to earn the vote, not assuming I'm going to have it because I am black, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=35.04s)]
*  but because the policies and the perspectives I have understands what we must do to recognize [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=42.56s)]
*  the needs of all communities. And I intend to be a president for all people. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=50.48s)]
*  Our young black men, our black men, just like any group of people, anybody, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=56.08s)]
*  our small businesses are really the backbone of our economy overall. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  And when they do better economically, we all do better. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=66.08s)]
*  Joining us now, White House correspondent for Politico and co-author of the playbook, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Eugene Janiels. Eugene was one of those conducting that interview yesterday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=75.6s)]
*  One of the moderators there with the vice president. Eugene, nice job yesterday. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=79.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=82.16s)]
*  So let's start there with this idea of young black men. We know that Donald Trump has spent [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=82.8s)]
*  some time trying to make inroads there. What are the latest in terms of the poll, say, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=87.6s)]
*  is he being successful? And what is the vice president doing to try to win their support, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  as she said, particularly on issues of like affordability? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, one of the things that's really interesting with Donald Trump is [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  the way that he does it, it kind of shows a party, a man who is kind of engaging with people they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=102.96s)]
*  don't typically do. Right. They do it in sometimes kind of clumsy ways. There's like the shiny shoes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=108.96s)]
*  There's these rappers. And that's kind of the view of which they go when they go and talk [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=113.52s)]
*  to black male voters. But some of it's working. Right. The polls are kind of all over the place. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=118.24s)]
*  So it's unclear how it would work out. And when you talk to black advocates and honestly, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=122.72s)]
*  black pollsters, they say it's hard to talk to and figure out how to poll black men specifically [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=126.72s)]
*  the black population in general. So that's one thing that folks when they look at these polls [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=132.4s)]
*  should take into account for Vice President Harris. Since she was just vice president and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  running mate, right, not the top of the ticket. She's been meeting with black men. She's brought [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=142.56s)]
*  them to the vice president to residents, presidents residents. And from there kind of birthed this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  economic tour, economic opportunity tour that she took on that was about black men. She had this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=151.12s)]
*  huge roundtable with black men about capital for entrepreneurship. And so there are ways in which [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=157.28s)]
*  she's talking about. But even in that clip, she zooms out even more and talks about how if you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=163.36s)]
*  help kind of the most marginalized communities in this country, it kind of it, right. All the boats [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=169.04s)]
*  rise. And I think that is kind of where their focus is. So she's talking about affordability. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=174.24s)]
*  She's talking about they want to be entrepreneurs. And she has said in the past, she wants the folks [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=178.32s)]
*  to get out of their way, help them give them the tools, but not baby them because you know, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=183.52s)]
*  black men don't want that or need it. No. So we played earlier in the show, a moment from your [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  interview yesterday where she talked about Springfield, Ohio, and the impact on children [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=192.88s)]
*  there because schools have been closed because of bomb threats. And that was a real theme yesterday, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=196.88s)]
*  this this this the idea of political violence and the rhetoric that inspires it, whether it's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  Springfield or the Trump assassination attempts for January six, tell us more about what she had to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=204.96s)]
*  say. Yeah, I mean, I think the thing that was most interesting is one, she said that she talked it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=208.96s)]
*  down on Trump, right. And she said that she told him what she'd said in public, which was that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=212.88s)]
*  political violence has no place in American politics. And on Springfield, I thought was one [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=217.6s)]
*  of maybe the most passionate answer that she gave that she gave and maybe has given ever on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=222.24s)]
*  on these kinds of issues. Because she started with the kids that were getting ready to go [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=228.4s)]
*  for picture day, right, and talked about the fact that they could they lost their picture day because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=234.16s)]
*  of that. She talked about if you are someone who wants the the mantle of leadership in this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=238.08s)]
*  country in the microphone she kept talking about, then you need to behave in a certain way. And it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=243.52s)]
*  kind of gave a lot of folks a view into Harris that she doesn't often get a give. And you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=248.72000000000003s)]
*  I've been covering her for four years. And these kinds of ways of thinking and pushing and talking [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=253.36s)]
*  about it, she doesn't always do. And luckily, we had so much time with her, we pushed, we pushed [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=258.24s)]
*  time we had with her to the brink. Her team was like peeking and trying to get us to cut it out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=263.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think you you got she got a lot of time to give people some insight [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=269.35999999999996s)]
*  into her head and who she is, which is what voters are looking at. And that's what I think, you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  she did so well to debate a week or so back. But the one criticism if there was that she perhaps [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=277.28s)]
*  didn't use the time to present more of her vision. She was so good at attacking Trump. And now she's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=282.0s)]
*  doing it. She's only done a few of these high profile interviews. She of course did one yesterday. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  So it feels like an opportunity for her team. Tell us more about her strategy and any other [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=291.6s)]
*  takeaways you had from yesterday. Yeah, I think the team says that they're going to keep doing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  interviews. I think they were looking at this one as kind of a big one to kind of get behind them. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=298.88s)]
*  But they say she's going to be doing a lot of sit downs on daytime talk shows that she's going [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  to radio and TV hits both both nationally and locally in these especially in the swing states. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  So that's one I mean, I guess my takeaway was that, you know, this was also a vice president, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=314.16s)]
*  who is grappling with race in a really interesting way. Right. When she talked about [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=319.12s)]
*  she when she talked about whether it was Springfield or reparations, or black men [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=325.44s)]
*  in the economy or earning their vote. She also always navigated to talking about the rest of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  American people and not that, you know, black people should be so enraged all the time about race, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=334.96s)]
*  but that everyone should be upset about racism. And it's a way to her allies, they bring people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=340.16s)]
*  into the conversation, instead of making white people frankly feel shamed about the kinds of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=345.68s)]
*  things that are happening in this country. We're writing about that I wrote about that in playbook [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=350.48s)]
*  this morning so that'll come out in a little bit. So she's tiptoeing around it in a really [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=354.16s)]
*  interesting way. And as only a black politician has to and can. Right. Very, very, very good point. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=357.52s)]
*  And an important interview. Yesterday. Nice job. Again, White House correspondent for Politico, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=362.4s)]
*  Eugene Daniels. Thank you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEdN4sqV5Wg&t=366.4s)]
