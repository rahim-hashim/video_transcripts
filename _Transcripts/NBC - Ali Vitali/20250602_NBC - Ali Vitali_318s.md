# Taylor Swift buys back rights to her first six albums
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4)
*  Welcome back. Taylor Swift is now saying you belong with me to all of her music. The pop [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=0.0s)]
*  superstar announced on Friday that she's regained control over her entire body of work after [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=7.0s)]
*  buying back the master recordings of her first six albums. Swift lost those rights in 2019 [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=12.0s)]
*  after her first record label sold out. As she puts it in a call back to one of her first hit songs, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=18.0s)]
*  quote, the best things that have ever been mine finally actually are. Joining us anchor for NBC [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=24.0s)]
*  News now, Savannah Sellers, my fellow Swiftie, Taylor Swift correspondent. I'm going to give you all the titles, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=31.0s)]
*  but just start us from the beginning here. Share a little bit more of the backstory. Why'd she have to buy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=36.0s)]
*  these back in the first place? Yeah, Ali, you and Taylor Swift are maybe the only two things that could [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=41.0s)]
*  get me here this early, so I'm happy to do it. Thank you for having me to talk about this. Okay, so the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=46.0s)]
*  backstory here is as you well know, Ali, the music industry often works like this, where even though [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=51.0s)]
*  you are an artist, it's your own work. It's things that you came up with your creativity, your [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=56.0s)]
*  handwriting. Literally, you might not actually own the rights to those songs. Whatever record deal you [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=61.0s)]
*  are on, which is what happened with Taylor Swift way back when she was just a teenager, means that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=66.0s)]
*  that deal is what you're locked into. So her songs had been owned completely by somebody else, and this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=71.0s)]
*  unfolded into a drama that went totally mainstream, became part of pop culture when Scooter Braun, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=76.0s)]
*  this famed talent agent who sort of discovered people and nurtured the careers of people like Justin Bieber, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=81.0s)]
*  bought her entire catalog of music when he bought the record label that she had been signed with Big Machine Records. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=87.0s)]
*  Taylor Swift came out and said, this is my worst case scenario. She claimed that Braun had been bullying her [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=94.0s)]
*  and essentially said, like, oh my goodness, this guy has all this work I've ever had. It has been this huge deal [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=99.0s)]
*  for her fans because she did something absolutely remarkable in re-recording her album, which I'm sure you want to talk about, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=104.0s)]
*  Ellie. Oh yeah, we definitely want to talk about that because it really became a call to action for fans in part [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=110.0s)]
*  because of the suggestion of Kelly Clarkson, who told Taylor, maybe you should just re-record all of these so that you can [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=115.0s)]
*  actually own them. That started the project of making Taylor's versions of all of these albums that were previously [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=121.0s)]
*  owned by Braun, thusly driving down the price and the value of those masters that other people now actually owned. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=127.0s)]
*  So now that they're all back in her ownership, what about the Taylor's versions? For people like me who were, you know, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=135.0s)]
*  jonesing for Taylor's version of reputation, am I getting that? What did she say? I know. Okay, we have so much to talk about there, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=141.0s)]
*  Ellie. First of all, I mean, we all love, like, every, all the Taylor lore, right? The fact that she still was sending [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=147.0s)]
*  Kelly Clarkson flowers and gifts every time that she put out a re-recorded album was just so cool, and Kelly was always like, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=153.0s)]
*  I don't know, I just tweeted it, and now here we go. It's just so cool. But yes, re-recording the albums, and for people who aren't familiar, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=159.0s)]
*  I mean, really just put this in context. These are albums which in their first iteration were pretty much all number one hit albums. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=165.0s)]
*  For them to come out again, in most cases be as similar as possible to the original album with some extra songs that were written back [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=171.0s)]
*  at the time as the original album, and then for those to also go totally number one, like break the internet, go viral, absolute best-selling albums [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=180.0s)]
*  once again, I mean, it just speaks to the power of this woman, the fact that she can release the same album a second time and make it more successful [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=188.0s)]
*  than the first time and a decade later in some cases. Reputation, Taylor's version, we need it. Ellie, I'm going to say this, we are blessed with a platform [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=195.0s)]
*  on national television, I'm going to beg Taylor. She wrote in this thing, if you're interested in it, maybe, okay, yes, we're interested, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=202.0s)]
*  we're more than interested, we need it, especially because what I just mentioned, they come with these things called vault tracks, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=209.0s)]
*  it's songs that were written at the time, so sometimes we're getting a new song to us that was written back when Taylor was a teenager, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=214.0s)]
*  which is just really neat for somebody who's obviously like the greatest songwriter of our generation, and we're hoping that she's going to release those, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=220.0s)]
*  she kind of teased it, like maybe if it's something you're interested in, we know now that she actually hasn't even finished recording Reputation, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=227.0s)]
*  the Taylor's version, which is sort of interesting, but we're waiting on Reputation, Taylor's version, as well as her debut album, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=234.0s)]
*  and Ellie, we just, we at least need the vault tracks. We at least need the vault tracks, yeah, I mean, if she's looking for Swifties to actually [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=240.0s)]
*  proactively tell her that we want this stuff, I'm glad you and I can finally use our positions on behalf of Swift Nation to say, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=247.0s)]
*  yeah, clip this, TikTok this, make this go viral, we need it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=254.0s)]
*  Taylor, we're happy to have you write in for a way too early, Why Are You Awake, if that's your jam, but we want the vault tracks, yeah, we deserve them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=257.0s)]
*  We need the Reputation vault tracks by summer, Ali, because it's like such a summer jam album, like we need them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=264.0s)]
*  Such a summer jam album, and you know what, we love a deadline, so I think that that's a nice deadline for all of us to work towards, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=271.0s)]
*  I think Taylor would appreciate it too. Savannah Sellers, thank you for coming on here, explaining it, and then also with that clarion call, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=278.0s)]
*  so we can get the vault tracks that we honestly deserve. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=284.0s)]
*  No, we do. I always appreciate it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=287.0s)]
*  She thanked us for helping Airstore be so successful, so she had all the money so she could buy the master, so give us the songs. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=288.0s)]
*  I see it no other way. Thank you, my friend. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=293.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r62PkRC3mL4&t=308.0s)]
