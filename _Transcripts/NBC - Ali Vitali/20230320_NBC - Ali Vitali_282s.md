# 20 years since the beginning of the war in Iraq
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8)
*  This hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=0.0s)]
*  to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=6.28s)]
*  That's President George W. Bush, 20 years ago, announcing that America and its allies [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=12.8s)]
*  had begun invading Iraq, that anniversary here today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=18.04s)]
*  Joining us now, senior coalition's advisor for Concerned Veterans for America, retired [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=23.2s)]
*  Master Sergeant Jason Beardsley. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=27.8s)]
*  He is a decorated combat veteran and intelligence officer and was deployed on multiple missions [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=29.44s)]
*  to Iraq over a decade's time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=34.6s)]
*  Sergeant Beardsley, first of all, thank you for being here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=36.92s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=38.8s)]
*  It is 20 years, sort of hard to believe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=40.68s)]
*  I just want to start just very simply. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=44.64s)]
*  What are you thinking about today as we hit that mark? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=45.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's an impressive date, but a lot of us that were in service were very proud [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=47.96s)]
*  to do it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=52.56s)]
*  I got to serve with some of the greatest people I know, some amazing leadership. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=54.56s)]
*  And yet, for all of that, we left friends behind. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=58.0s)]
*  There's a lot of moral injury, physical injury, emotional injury. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  And it left a lot of Iraq veterans, particularly Afghanistan veterans, wondering what was it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=64.48s)]
*  all for? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=70.0s)]
*  What was the gain? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=71.0s)]
*  And I think that's the important thing we need to reflect on overall, is how do we ensure [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=72.26s)]
*  that we don't do that again? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=76.88s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about your time there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=79.56s)]
*  I know you said you've been on and off there for about a decade. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=81.8s)]
*  Some missions perhaps covert, you can't speak about. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  But tell us some of your experiences overseas there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I remember the feeling first, understanding that we were willing to go. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=90.24s)]
*  We wanted to render justice up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Once we got into the fight, once you started to see the developing sort of strategy or [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=97.44s)]
*  the tactics unfolding on the ground, it felt like there wasn't as much purpose to it or [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=101.36s)]
*  the objectives were not as clear. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  Once you started losing friends and seeing people that were injured or coming home with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=109.04s)]
*  less than what they went overseas with, it really sort of made this poignant for each [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=112.88s)]
*  of us individually. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  How do we feel about this? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  How do you justify a reconciled going back into combat, leading men and women into combat, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  not really understanding what the ultimate objective is? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=125.88s)]
*  Over time, those kinds of things start to wear on the individuals that are burying their [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=129.2s)]
*  friends across the way here in Arlington. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=132.72s)]
*  I think after all of that, you start to reflect on how hard it was on the families and how [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=135.96s)]
*  much the veterans actually bear the burden of this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  For my money, the real information now is how do we tell the American people it's important [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=144.28s)]
*  that our Congress is involved in these decisions every time we still have folks in Iraq today? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=148.92s)]
*  That's an important thing to remember. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=155.96s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly right now, there's the backdrop of Congress debating and potentially [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=157.44s)]
*  take back some of the authority on a war making, not just totally ceding it to the executive [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  branch. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  Give us your sense on that and also how much progress you think there has been made to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  do what you hope for, which is to end endless wars raged by this war nation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=171.92s)]
*  Some progress, and I think senators like Kaine and Senators Young have proposed taking that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=176.56s)]
*  authority back, repealing the outdated authorities that got us into those situations so that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=181.16s)]
*  every Congress participates in the decision to put our men and women into harm's way. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=186.72s)]
*  And that's important, but it hasn't been as immediately necessary or important, I think, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=191.64s)]
*  or critical in the national dialogue. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=197.44s)]
*  So for you covering this and for bringing attention to the actual pains and how we get [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=199.6s)]
*  through that, I really appreciate that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=204.28s)]
*  And I know our veterans do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=205.92s)]
*  Concerned Veterans for America, my organization, Stand Together, we really want to make sure [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=208.12s)]
*  the Americans are involved in this policy debate. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=212.32s)]
*  And so bringing that here to Washington, D.C. is important to me. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  And lastly, just very briefly, just give us an update. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=219.34s)]
*  So many veterans came back from Iraq with real challenges, real struggles. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=221.22s)]
*  What Americans can do to help? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=225.42s)]
*  So right now, there's a lot in the way of veterans affairs and the benefits there, but [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=226.89999999999998s)]
*  what Americans can do is make sure that Congress stays accountable, holds the bureaucracies, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  the administration is accountable for delivering those benefits. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=237.26s)]
*  There's a lot that can be done on things like VA choice and how do we get those benefits [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=240.34s)]
*  delivered to those who dealt with the harm of battle? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=245.14s)]
*  So doing that means staying involved and sometimes it means putting pressure on Congress. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=248.45999999999998s)]
*  Twenty years ago today, the United States began its invasion of Iraq. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  Retired Master Sergeant Jason Beardsley, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=256.82s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93NR9ZY_Kx8&t=260.62s)]
