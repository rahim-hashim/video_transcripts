# House GOP calls for Liz Cheney to be investigated over Jan. 6 committee role
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U)
*  Welcome back. House Republicans are calling for former Congressman Liz Cheney to be investigated [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=0.0s)]
*  for her work on the January 6th Select Committee, which of course looked into Donald Trump and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  the attack on the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. Now this could potentially lay the groundwork [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=12.24s)]
*  for Cheney to face criminal prosecution. In a statement, Cheney criticized her work calling [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=17.68s)]
*  it a malicious and cowardly assault on the truth, adding that no reputable lawyer, legislator, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=24.8s)]
*  or judge would take this seriously. Donald Trump weighed in, posting about the report [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=31.44s)]
*  on social media at 3.30 this morning, just a couple hours ago. He wrote this, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=36.32s)]
*  Cheney could be in a lot of trouble, while Trump went on to thank Congressman Laudermilk for, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=41.44s)]
*  quote, a job well done. Joining us now, MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle. Mike, thank you so [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=46.72s)]
*  much for joining us. You're welcome. We've always appreciated it. So let's talk about Liz Cheney [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=54.32s)]
*  here. And first, we'll get to Trump in a moment. But first, just as actions from her former [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=62.8s)]
*  colleagues, people who served with her day in, day out in the House of Representatives. There's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=67.36s)]
*  been no allegation of actual crime here, not that I can see, but yet they're banning about the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=72.4s)]
*  possibility of criminal charges. What does that tell us? It tells us that Washington is filled [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=77.6s)]
*  with people who make a lot of noise. I mean, who's going to charge her? The House Republican [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=82.16s)]
*  Caucus? What court is she going to go to? This is nothing but politics, and people are sick of it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=86.8s)]
*  So Trump chimed in a few hours later, suggested that he might very well support this. You know, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=92.96s)]
*  I would agree with you that there doesn't seem to be much in the way of legal standing for any of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=101.12s)]
*  this, but it certainly seems to be part of his effort to, of retribution and intimidation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=105.36s)]
*  You know, as everyone in America knows and the world now knows, Jonathan, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump is a very interesting figure, a very underrated figure, because he has learned how to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=116.24s)]
*  manipulate the media in this country like no one in our history. And he does it by being semi-outrageous [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=123.52s)]
*  to outrageous, by saying things that people can't believe when he says them, because they're lies, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=131.6s)]
*  some of the things he says, and other oddities of his performances at press conferences or even [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  on Truth Social. And so what happens to us when he does that? We pay more attention to him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  That's what he wants. Well, let's take, I think it's actually an important moment, though, because [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=149.12s)]
*  at 3.30 a.m. he posted twice. One of them was about Canada being the 51st state. That's obviously [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=153.04s)]
*  ridiculous. That's to try to just get some headlines. But the idea of Liz, the other one, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  the Liz Cheney arrest threat, that feels a little more real. I mean, he has been for a year now [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=162.08s)]
*  promising retribution. We know that he's trying to staff his administration with loyalists to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=167.04s)]
*  carry that out. And lots of his people who support him, his base are expecting and demanding this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=171.84s)]
*  action. That feels like a dangerous concoction, no? What's dangerous is that he was up at 3.30 [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=177.6s)]
*  in the morning tweeting. I mean, what is he doing? He's president-elect. He's got a job to do. He's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=182.4s)]
*  got a job to think about. Get some rest. Well, that's never his sleeping patterns have always [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=187.52s)]
*  been a subject of fascination. But so you think that this is a moment where there's that old [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=192.56s)]
*  line about Trump, take him, whether you should take him literally or seriously, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  do you not take him seriously? You don't think you don't think he will? No. Okay. No. Let's so, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=203.28s)]
*  but some people clearly do think he might. And some of them work in the West Wing, where there's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=208.4s)]
*  been a series of robust conversations in recent weeks about whether or not to issue preemptive [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=213.84s)]
*  pardons to people that Trump has identified as a political foe, whether that is Liz Cheney or [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=221.76s)]
*  Mark Milley, potentially even the former people, John Brennan, maybe members of the media. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=226.16s)]
*  What's the latest you've heard about those discussions and do you think they're a good idea? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=231.44s)]
*  I think several people who have been named as potential recipients of a pardon [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=235.84s)]
*  have indicated to the White House, no, they don't want a pardon. They will not accept a pardon. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=243.28s)]
*  There are people who maybe ought to get a pardon like Cassidy Hussin. Is that her name? Yes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=248.48s)]
*  Used to work for Mark Meadows. Yeah. Maybe she should get a pardon because there are [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=253.76s)]
*  several people on that list of potential targets who certainly could not afford half a million [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=257.92s)]
*  dollars in legal fees to pay for a defense if they go after her. And last quick question, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=264.24s)]
*  you obviously have covered President Biden for a long time. He is certainly at his heart an [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  institutionalist. A wave of preemptive pardons would certainly be a break from a norm. Do you [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  think he's something he would seriously consider? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I do. We will find out in the... [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=279.36s)]
*  I expected, this is your last week on Way Too Early, that you and I would do flashbacks of [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=285.04s)]
*  my prior appearances, but I guess not. Yeah. They're still working on the montage of the clips, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=291.2s)]
*  but hopefully we can run that later or perhaps in January after Ali takes over and the show's in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=296.4s)]
*  good hands. It'll look back at some of our fondest moments. Mike, we have always appreciated it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=302.24s)]
*  We'll see you in a few minutes on Morning Joe. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3FLKn6p71U&t=306.48s)]
