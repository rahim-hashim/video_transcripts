# Sarah Huckabee Sanders remains neutral in 2024 race
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY)
*  Meanwhile, though, Trump is getting increasingly frustrated with Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=0.0s)]
*  Sanders as the governor remains neutral in that GOP presidential race. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=5.38s)]
*  According to people familiar with the discussions, Sanders' team has told Trump's campaign she [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=11.08s)]
*  won't endorse any candidate until her first legislative session ends. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=15.9s)]
*  She just took office back in January. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=20.3s)]
*  Well, that session ended in May, and Sanders has yet to make an announcement. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=22.3s)]
*  She of course was Trump's press secretary, and he endorsed her the very day she launched [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=26.74s)]
*  her gubernatorial campaign back a couple of years ago. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=32.22s)]
*  Joining us now, national political correspondent for Axios, Alex Thompson. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=35.66s)]
*  He of course is the one who had this reporting first on Trump and Huckabee Sanders. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=39.5s)]
*  So walk us through it here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=43.9s)]
*  What's the reasoning from the new governor of Arkansas for staying neutral? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=46.459999999999994s)]
*  She faithfully served as Trump's press secretary for quite some time while he was in the White [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=51.06s)]
*  House, although she had long departed before the 2020 election or January 6th. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=55.98s)]
*  What's the calculation here? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=60.86s)]
*  How do you see this going? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=61.86s)]
*  There are two things really at play here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=63.98s)]
*  One is that Sarah Huckabee Sanders has actually grown quite personally close with Florida [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=66.06s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=70.74s)]
*  She hired his chancellor for education to be her education secretary when she took over [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=72.3s)]
*  as governor earlier this year. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=78.42s)]
*  She also went to this big donor confab last July. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=80.38s)]
*  Critically, she and Casey DeSantis have become personally close as they've sort of bonded [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=83.86s)]
*  over their mutual fights with cancer the last few years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, the other subtext here that's really important to understand is that Sarah Huckabee [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  Sanders, her allies say, is gearing up for potentially her own White House run in 2028 [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  or 2032 and is trying to craft a national political identity that is outside of her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=102.54s)]
*  service to Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=108.86s)]
*  She's not alone in a lot of Republicans with presidential ambitions. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=111.1s)]
*  Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Greg Abbott, who have decided not to who have decided to remain [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=114.78s)]
*  neutral in this race so far, trying to sort of get the lay of the land, wait and see what [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=119.74s)]
*  happens. The complication for Sarah Huckabee Sanders, of course, is that she worked for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=125.1s)]
*  Donald Trump and he feels a little personally betrayed by her staying neutral so far, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=128.9s)]
*  especially when she her original excuse was that she just wanted to wait till this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=133.74s)]
*  legislative legislative session ended. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=138.34s)]
*  So we know that Donald Trump is not someone who takes perceived slights well, shall we say. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=141.06s)]
*  He demands loyalty and loyalty at all times. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=146.5s)]
*  So what is coming from Trump or Trump's camp about Sarah Huckabee Sanders' refusal to get [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=148.9s)]
*  on board so far? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=155.18s)]
*  You can tell that this relationship is incredibly sensitive because if it had been anybody [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=156.82s)]
*  else, there would have already been, you know, half a dozen posts on Truth Social attacking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  Sarah Huckabee Sanders for being a traitor or for, you know, that he made her and that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=166.62s)]
*  But instead, a lot of this action has been happening behind the scenes with aides basically [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=172.38s)]
*  going back and forth, hoping to sort of coax her into just endorsing instead of rather [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=180.02s)]
*  attacking her personally. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=185.06s)]
*  That's just a sign of how sensitive the relationship between the two of them, because she was [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=186.78s)]
*  a very loyal aide and arguably probably the most effective press secretary of the several [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=191.9s)]
*  that he had during his presidency. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=196.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think a little question of that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=198.9s)]
*  So, Alex, let's take a step back. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  We just showed a poll there that shows that Trump's lead is still just truly significant [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=202.22s)]
*  over the rest of the GOP field. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  But now, of course, he is staring most likely at his third indictment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=208.98000000000002s)]
*  You know, we ran through yesterday the response from the various Republican candidates. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=213.34s)]
*  Chris Christie, Asa Hutchison went on the attack, really denounced Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  The rest of them turned their fire morts towards the Department of Justice. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  Isn't this in some ways what they've been waiting for, particularly Governor DeSantis, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=223.94s)]
*  whose whole theory of the case seems to be, hey, if Trump implodes, I'm the next guy standing? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=227.38s)]
*  How are they going to respond here in the weeks ahead? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  What are your sources telling you? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  The most interesting thing I saw and that senior Republicans were really talking about [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=237.3s)]
*  to me yesterday was that this indictment is unlike the others and that it is about January [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  6th, which many of these Republicans denounced. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=248.94s)]
*  In some cases, they really think that Donald Trump acted incredibly irresponsibly that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=252.74s)]
*  day. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=257.66s)]
*  And yet even yesterday, you saw, or I guess it was the other day, Ron DeSantis made some [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=258.66s)]
*  very mild criticism of Trump's actions on that day. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=263.14s)]
*  He essentially just said he waited too long to ask for people to stop being violent. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=267.1s)]
*  And even then, his campaign sought to clarify, said, oh, you know, look at the broader context [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=272.22s)]
*  of his answer. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=277.86s)]
*  Vivek Ramaswamy, also someone that called Trump very irresponsible that day, has since [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=279.5s)]
*  said that Donald Trump doesn't bear responsibility for January 6th. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=284.14s)]
*  So what's been really striking to me is that on this indictment and probably the next indictment [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=288.14s)]
*  that we're expecting out of Georgia, this is about January 6th, where Republicans would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=293.06s)]
*  likely be able to have their easiest path to criticize Trump's actions. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=297.54s)]
*  And yet so far, early indications are that they don't want to criticize Donald Trump [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=301.7s)]
*  over perhaps his biggest vulnerability. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  And we'll see if that changes the next few weeks. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=308.14s)]
*  Yeah, we saw the same from Kevin McCarthy as well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=310.34s)]
*  And I think this can't be said enough. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=312.5s)]
*  This is partially a product of two years of Trump and the conservative media downplaying [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=314.74s)]
*  what happened on January 6th, conditioning Republican voters to say, hey, it wasn't that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=319.26s)]
*  bad. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=323.7s)]
*  And now they're seeing that here, that Trump has has convinced them that, hey, this is [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=324.9s)]
*  not a thing to criticize me on. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=329.18s)]
*  We're all in this together. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  And yet again, his lead just grows. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=332.7s)]
*  Axios says, Alex Thompson, great stuff this morning. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=334.86s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JDRsmjyiQY&t=337.26s)]
