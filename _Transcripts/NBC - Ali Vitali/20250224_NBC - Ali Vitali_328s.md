# Marking three years since the beginning of Russia's war on Ukraine
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk)
*  Today marks three years since Russia launched its unprovoked full-scale war on Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=0.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal estimated that over a million troops in total had been wounded [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=6.24s)]
*  or killed as of this fall. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=10.0s)]
*  According to the UN Refugee Agency, nearly seven million refugees from Ukraine have been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  recorded globally since 2022. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=16.44s)]
*  Last night, on the eve of the third anniversary, Russia launched what Ukrainian President Zelensky [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  is calling the largest drone attack since the start of the war. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=23.6s)]
*  Ukraine's Air Force says 138 drones were shot down while over 100 more dropped from the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=27.8s)]
*  radar after being jammed by defensive electronics. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=32.64s)]
*  According to Ukraine, Russia also launched three ballistic missiles with damage reported [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=35.88s)]
*  in five different regions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=40.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Ukraine is pushing back against an even more outlandish U.S. proposal for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=42.44s)]
*  its natural resources, with President Zelensky rejecting demands that would see Kyiv handing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  over half its resource revenues to a U.S.-controlled fund until it reaches $500 billion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=51.8s)]
*  The latest draft tougher than the last, also demanding Ukraine repay the U.S. double any [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  future aid it receives, all without firm security guarantees. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  Zelensky also hit back at President Trump's comments, calling him a dictator. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=69.28s)]
*  He said yesterday he's willing to resign from his post in exchange for peace in Ukraine [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=73.36s)]
*  or NATO membership. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=77.56s)]
*  Zelensky also announced a summit of European leaders will be held today in Ukraine, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=79.56s)]
*  officials from 27 EU countries will hold an emergency meeting once again next week to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=84.08s)]
*  discuss support for Ukraine. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=89.08s)]
*  Joining us now, retired CIA officer Mark Polymeropoulos. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=91.52s)]
*  He's an NBC News security and intelligence analyst. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=94.6s)]
*  Mark, you've been following this war for years now, and we often talk about Ukraine's resilience, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=97.32s)]
*  but can you also talk about the role that U.S. and European aid has had in getting them [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  to this point consistently the underdog? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=107.76s)]
*  Well, Ali, let's be clear. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=110.28s)]
*  The U.S. has provided $100 billion. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=111.84s)]
*  And when you think about it, it's an incredible investment. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  Russia is an enemy of the United States. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Let's be very clear on that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  If you remember when Russia was paying bounties to the Taliban to kill our soldiers in Afghanistan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  But for $100 billion, what have we done? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  We've helped the Ukrainians attrit 50 percent of the Russian military, sink nearly their [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  entire Black Sea fleet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=131.9s)]
*  So in fact, Ukraine is doing us a favor in this notion, and this has to do with the mineral [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=133.92s)]
*  deal that somehow that Ukraine should be thankful to the United States. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=138.11999999999998s)]
*  I think it's the other way around. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=142.64s)]
*  I think we should be thanking Ukraine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=143.64s)]
*  And in my view, this mineral deal is simply extortion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=145.32s)]
*  Well, we've also seen Zelensky say he's going to hold a firm line on that, that he doesn't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=148.0s)]
*  want to be putting future Ukrainian leaders in the position of having decades worth of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=152.2s)]
*  payments to make back to the United States, especially when that $500 billion number far [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=157.04s)]
*  exceeds the amount of aid that the U.S. has actually put into the country so far. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  He's holding a hard line. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  He's saying, I'll step down if it means I can get my country into NATO or we can find [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  an end to this war. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=172.72s)]
*  What do you make of this posture that Zelensky is now taking amid an onslaught from the president [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  of the United States? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=178.88s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=179.88s)]
*  And Ali, I think actually his Zelensky's popularity in Ukraine is rising. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=180.88s)]
*  He's standing up to a bully. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=184.72s)]
*  He's actually saying, look, if we received security guarantees from NATO, I'll step down. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=186.64s)]
*  He's not a dictator. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  The bully in this case, I think, is important to point out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=192.72s)]
*  We're not talking about Putin. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=194.28s)]
*  Is Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=195.52s)]
*  Is Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  And so I think Zelensky is posturing himself correctly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  I think the real question is, if these negotiations go on with the mineral deal, what are the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=200.24s)]
*  security guarantees? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't think we've seen what exactly they would be. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  And more importantly, can Europe step up? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=208.36s)]
*  Zelensky can afford to be fighting back against the U.S. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=210.0s)]
*  In many ways, I think a lot of us understand what he's doing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  But Europe has got to be the one to then come in and say, look, if the U.S. is not going [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=216.66000000000003s)]
*  to be there for you, we will. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  And we've seen them do these kinds of group emergency meetings over the course of the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=221.12s)]
*  last two weeks, as the landscape has really just been shifting under them with the new [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=224.96s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  I want to talk, though, about a piece that you put on MSNBC.com this weekend. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  You say, I'm a former U.S. intelligence officer. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump's Ukraine betrayal will have terrible consequences. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=237.28s)]
*  Detail those. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=241.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=242.0s)]
*  So, Ali, I wrote this because I was a practitioner and I was a case officer for the CIA. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=243.0s)]
*  And what does that mean? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=246.36s)]
*  It means we work with indigenous forces, whether it's Afghans in Afghanistan, whether it's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=247.36s)]
*  Iraqi Kurds in Syria. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=251.0s)]
*  So we break bread with them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=252.72s)]
*  We are with them through thick and thin. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=254.08s)]
*  There's almost this personal relationship you develop. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=255.96s)]
*  And so there is a feeling of betrayal. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=258.84s)]
*  How do we look at our Ukrainian allies in the face on this? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=260.52s)]
*  But I think there's a bigger picture here is who's going to trust us in the future? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=263.96s)]
*  America is supposed to be the bright, shining city on the Hill. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=267.32s)]
*  But if we walk away from Ukraine and, in fact, switch sides, I think when it comes to issues [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=270.2s)]
*  such as China, Taiwan and other places, will Taiwan look to us to come in as the knight [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=276.04s)]
*  in shining armor? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=282.44s)]
*  They won't. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=283.44s)]
*  And so we're losing trust. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=284.44s)]
*  And I think there's a giant crisis in U.S. credibility around the world now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=285.68s)]
*  And we heard that same credibility question be raised after that chaotic and tragic withdrawal [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=289.24s)]
*  from Afghanistan. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  Now to see it be raised again under a different administration, it really does speak to United [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  States credibility across the world. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=301.48s)]
*  Thank you for your insight and your expertise. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzRXQVBqpk&t=303.84s)]
