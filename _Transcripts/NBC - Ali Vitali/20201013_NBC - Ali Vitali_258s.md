# Both Parties On Message At Confirmation Hearings | Way Too Early | MSNBC
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY)
*  Joining us now, attorney and former GOP staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Greg Nunziata. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=0.0s)]
*  Greg, good morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=5.44s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=6.44s)]
*  You've seen and worked on so many of these hearings over the years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=7.44s)]
*  And I was struck by how completely coordinated both sides were, frankly, in the way that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=14.8s)]
*  they approached things yesterday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=20.88s)]
*  I'm curious if you think that we are going to continue down what feels like a very predictable [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=23.68s)]
*  path here, or if we might see something interesting, some fireworks today, what are the risks for [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=30.32s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett, no matter how preordained the outcome seems here? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=36.64s)]
*  These are incredibly high stakes, high profile events, really the event of her career so far. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=41.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, you're right, Casey. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=47.92s)]
*  The first day of the hearing was unusually disciplined. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=49.36s)]
*  The first day is always the most scripted, and both parties stuck to their script more [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=52.4s)]
*  devotedly than usual. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=57.12s)]
*  Sometimes they seemed like different scripts for different movies. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  They were trying to do very different things. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=62.8s)]
*  Today is the first day that the judge gets to answer questions. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=64.8s)]
*  And you're right that it looks like she's on her way to swift confirmation, but hearings [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=68.48s)]
*  are unscripted from here on out, and she will need to demonstrate poise, mastery of the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=75.12s)]
*  law, and ability to put some of her writings in context. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=80.0s)]
*  Democrats will want to seize on a sentence here or a sentence there that seemed to suggest [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=84.24s)]
*  something frightening about her or that she'll rule a certain way, and she'll have to very [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=91.44s)]
*  carefully explain things in a manner that average voters can understand. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think she's well prepared to do that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=101.28s)]
*  She's been a law professor. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=103.2s)]
*  She's taught these things to students for years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=104.4s)]
*  So I expect her to perform well, but certainly today and tomorrow are the days of the most [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=107.36s)]
*  peril in the hearings. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=113.6s)]
*  It seems like Democrats have essentially made the calculation, Greg, too. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=116.88s)]
*  And I think this is probably true of Republicans as well, that they don't want to mess anything [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=122.08s)]
*  up. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=127.44s)]
*  And for Republicans, that's obviously getting this nominee onto the court before the election [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  and any potential political changes, shall we say, could upset the possibility she could [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  be seated. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  But for Democrats, it also seems, to me, let's not mess this up for Joe Biden, our [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=138.4s)]
*  Democratic nominee, when he seems to be so far ahead in the polls. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=144.32s)]
*  Let's keep this focused on health care. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=148.4s)]
*  Is that the sense you get as well that they are trying to focus on the November election [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=152.72s)]
*  messaging? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=157.84s)]
*  And do you think it's working? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=158.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's fascinating. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=161.76s)]
*  I mean, we saw, if you remember, in the Kavanaugh hearings on the first day, Democrats tried to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=162.72s)]
*  disrupt it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=167.04s)]
*  They tried procedural moves to delay the consideration of the hearing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=167.76s)]
*  And there was talk about that for this process over the last several weeks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  And we saw none of that yesterday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=175.6s)]
*  And it really appears, from the way they're conducting themselves and from the way they've [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  spoken to reporters, that Democrats have decided that they can't stop this confirmation, and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=182.0s)]
*  that they're not going to try and that they don't want to look obstructive and they don't [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  want to take the conversation away from themes they think are helping Joe Biden, particularly [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=191.04s)]
*  health care. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=195.76s)]
*  So you see them here with these placards up of faces of patients. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=196.48s)]
*  It's a very kind of political performance. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=200.0s)]
*  It's almost like an Affordable Care Act rally rather than a confirmation hearing on the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Democratic side of the aisle. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=206.56s)]
*  And it's probably smart politics, but I think it's going to fall fairly thin over the next [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=208.0s)]
*  couple of days when Judge Barrett is asked to answer questions about the Affordable Care [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=213.04s)]
*  Act. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=218.0s)]
*  Despite what some Democrats have said, their hand is not as strong as it sounds here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=218.64s)]
*  I think most legal scholars doubt that she would vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=223.12s)]
*  the case that's coming before her if she is confirmed this year. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=228.56s)]
*  All right. I guess we will likely find out the answer to that question, because as we've [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  been talking about, she is likely to land on the bench. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=239.2s)]
*  Greg Nunziata, thank you so much for getting up early with us, my friend. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=241.2s)]
*  I really appreciate your time. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ur-q1-hyCY&t=244.0s)]
