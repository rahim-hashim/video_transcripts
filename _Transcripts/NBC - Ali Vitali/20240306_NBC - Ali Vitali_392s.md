# The race is on to replace Mitch McConnell
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY)
*  The race is on to replace Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=0.0s)]
*  And what was a three-man campaign has now shrunk to just two [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=4.0s)]
*  after Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming announced that he would not run for the position. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=8.0s)]
*  In a letter to his colleagues, Barrasso, the third most powerful Republican in the Senate, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=13.0s)]
*  announced that instead he would run for the number two position of whip. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=18.0s)]
*  The race to the top spot is now between current Minority Whip Senator John Foon of South Dakota [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=23.0s)]
*  and former whip John Cornyn of Texas. Yes, all the men had the first name John. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=28.0s)]
*  Those two, Cornyn and Foon, have both formally announced they're running for McConnell's job. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=33.0s)]
*  The election for the GOP conference chair is also shaping up to be a close fight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=38.0s)]
*  Fourth-ranked Senator Joni Ernst, who is considering a run for the position, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=41.0s)]
*  called out her colleague Senator Tom Cotton yesterday after he announced a bid without giving his party a heads up. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=45.0s)]
*  I want to be in whatever role I can help my fellow senators and President Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=52.0s)]
*  best achieve our shared goals for the American people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=57.0s)]
*  Some of my colleagues have approached me about the conference chair job, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=60.0s)]
*  the number three position in leadership. I'm focusing on that position right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=63.0s)]
*  Elections for Senate Republican leadership will be held behind closed doors this November. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=67.0s)]
*  Joining us now, communication strategist and former aide to House speakers Ryan and Boehner, Brendan Buck. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=73.0s)]
*  He's also an MSNBC political analyst. Brendan, good to see you this morning. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=79.0s)]
*  So let's get just your overview of the Senate leadership races. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=83.0s)]
*  And what sort of role do you think Donald Trump will play? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=87.0s)]
*  Well, I think he could play a really important role. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=91.0s)]
*  And to that point, I think I would be surprised if it ends up just being John Cornyn and John Foon in this race. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=93.0s)]
*  It was a bit of a surprise that John Barrasso decided to take a pass on it and run for the number two spot. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=100.0s)]
*  The reminder that the way this works, you only need a simple majority. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=106.0s)]
*  So if it is just those two, it would be a pretty straightforward election. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=109.0s)]
*  But there is a pretty significant block of Senate Republicans who are pretty disgruntled. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=113.0s)]
*  There are folks who are taking shots at McConnell and they are much more of the MAGA wing of the party. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=119.0s)]
*  It would surprise me if they don't recruit someone, if only to serve as to block one of those two Johns [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=125.0s)]
*  and at least have a seat at the table in the election behind closed doors. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=132.0s)]
*  Whether that is someone like Steve Daines, who currently chairs the party committee, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=136.0s)]
*  there is a group who want to go in a completely different direction than what Mitch McConnell has gone in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=141.0s)]
*  And the two Johns that remain are pretty establishment standard Republicans. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=147.0s)]
*  John Cornyn was in leadership for 10 years. John Foon is currently the number two. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=151.0s)]
*  So I imagine we are going to have a little more drama to this race, which is going to last eight months, as you said, November. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=156.0s)]
*  That is an extremely long time for a leadership race. It could get very ugly, could get very personal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=163.0s)]
*  And I imagine Donald Trump at the end could have a big say. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=168.0s)]
*  If there is someone he doesn't want to be the Republican leader, I imagine he has the power to make that happen. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=171.0s)]
*  Safe bet that it will be ugly and personal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=176.0s)]
*  Brendan, I want to go a little deeper in some of the developments yesterday in a couple of key battleground states, presidential battleground states. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=179.0s)]
*  First of all, in Arizona, Kirsten Sinema says she's not going to run free elections. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=186.0s)]
*  So now we have a two-person Senate race with Kerry Lake being the Republican. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=190.0s)]
*  And then in North Carolina, which is the state the Democrats, the one state on the map that Trump won last time, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=194.0s)]
*  the Democrats think they can pick up this time around. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=198.0s)]
*  The Republicans have nominated a man named Mark Robinson for governor. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=201.0s)]
*  He's a legitimate Holocaust denier and has also said a number of deeply offensive things about several groups. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=204.0s)]
*  What you read here as to what those two states, what we saw yesterday could impact November in those two states. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=210.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big deal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=216.0s)]
*  Obviously, in an election year, the top of the ticket is going to drive most things. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=218.0s)]
*  If we're mostly focused on whether Biden or Trump is going to win North Carolina, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=222.0s)]
*  I don't know that the governor in the race is really going to decide that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=226.0s)]
*  But it could imagine on the margins in one of these states, both Arizona and North Carolina could be razor thin margins and everything can could sway the outcome. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=230.0s)]
*  If you have a situation where you're a say a Nikki Haley Republican and you are just sort of fed up with the direction of the party [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=240.0s)]
*  and you see that that is your governor nominee, you may just be inclined to stay home. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=246.0s)]
*  And that could be enough to swing the state one way or the other. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=251.0s)]
*  Obviously, in Arizona, I think Democrats are pleased that they've got a much clearer path and a much clearer situation that they're dealing with. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=255.0s)]
*  They clearly see Kerry Lake as a toxic candidate and it makes it a much easier dynamic for them for them to play with. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=263.0s)]
*  But again, we're talking about razor thin margins that could decide the president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=270.0s)]
*  And so all of these developments are really important in the bigger context. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=274.0s)]
*  Yeah, in a race that is expected to be super, super close. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=278.0s)]
*  So, Brennan, you mentioned Nikki Haley. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=282.0s)]
*  She did post one win last night and put up reasonably impressive showings in a few other states. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=284.0s)]
*  But Trump now just about 150 delegates away from clinching the nomination. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=289.0s)]
*  Haley had said she'd stay in the Super Tuesday. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=292.0s)]
*  It's now the day after that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=295.0s)]
*  What do you anticipate she'll do next? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=296.0s)]
*  Well, I guess I'll say I anticipated her to drop out long before now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=299.0s)]
*  I think it's been very clear that she wasn't going to win and she has served as a protest candidate. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=304.0s)]
*  I still sort of expect that this is winding down and she knows it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=309.0s)]
*  The math is very clear that she's not going to win. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=312.0s)]
*  The big question is not necessarily whether she drops out or stays in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=315.0s)]
*  It's what does she signal to people who voted for her? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=319.0s)]
*  I don't think that Nikki Haley necessarily commands every one of those people's votes. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=323.0s)]
*  Those are clearly, I think, anti-Trump votes. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=327.0s)]
*  But if she tries to signal to those people that it's OK to come back to Donald Trump, it's OK to sort of come back in the fold. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=330.0s)]
*  If she wants to say, OK, we need to unify, do the standard politician thing, that would be interesting. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=336.0s)]
*  But I'm more interested to see whether she wants to lead the party in a different direction. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=342.0s)]
*  I don't think that there is a real post-Trump future for her or anybody at any time in the near term. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=345.0s)]
*  But if she wants to stand on morals and principles and say it's OK not to vote for Donald Trump this time around, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=351.0s)]
*  I think she could have a significant legacy and impact on the race in November. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=357.0s)]
*  And her team very tight-lipped last night. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=361.0s)]
*  What she'll do next, we didn't hear from Haley personally, no speech. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=363.0s)]
*  So we'll see what happens in the days ahead as she weighs her future. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=365.0s)]
*  Brendan Buck, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F-XEsMPyY&t=369.0s)]
