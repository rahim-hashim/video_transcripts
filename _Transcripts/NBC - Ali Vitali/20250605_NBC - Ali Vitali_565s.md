# Trump orders investigation of Biden and his aides
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ)
*  And then, of course, that other executive order, signing a wide order, ordering a wide-ranging [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  investigation into former President Joe Biden and his aides, this latest attack on his political [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=5.38s)]
*  rival. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=10.3s)]
*  Trump is accusing the aides of covering up Biden's alleged cognitive decline and using [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=11.3s)]
*  the auto pen to sign bills and assert exclusive presidential power, including on pardons, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=15.0s)]
*  executive orders and other documents. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=19.88s)]
*  Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the White House counsel to lead that investigation, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=21.98s)]
*  but the move appears to be an effort to possibly pave the way for Republicans to argue that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=26.46s)]
*  many of Biden's actions as president weren't valid. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=29.98s)]
*  But let's be clear here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=33.4s)]
*  The Justice Department, during its administration under both parties, has recognized the use [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=34.4s)]
*  of auto pen to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=38.28s)]
*  And Trump presented zero evidence that Biden was unaware of any actions taken in his name. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=42.5s)]
*  Also, the president's absolute pardon power is enshrined in the Constitution. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=46.94s)]
*  Biden released a statement, though, on this investigation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  It read in part, let me be clear. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=54.0s)]
*  I made the decisions during my presidency. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=55.64s)]
*  I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=58.46s)]
*  Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=62.88s)]
*  With all that, let's bring in White House reporter for Politico Jake Traylor. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=67.06s)]
*  Jake, let's just start with all of these new White House actions, the revival of the travel [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=70.4s)]
*  ban, targeting continually Harvard University and then, of course, Joe Biden. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=75.4s)]
*  Is this a sign that all of the Musk stuff on Capitol Hill is getting to the White House [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=80.58s)]
*  and the president? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=84.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very good question. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=86.38000000000001s)]
*  It's something that is not completely unprecedented or unsurprising that we see, especially in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=88.66s)]
*  a Trump administration, in a Trump White House. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=94.5s)]
*  We were looking at a week where there wasn't a lot of good news for Donald Trump, especially [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=96.92s)]
*  when it came to post after post on X from Elon Musk going after this mega bill, creating [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=101.14s)]
*  quite the stir on Capitol Hill and over at the White House. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=106.56s)]
*  When we have something like this take place, it's not completely uncommon that a lot of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=109.38s)]
*  times the White House kind of buries some of those other stories all in there at once. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=113.82s)]
*  All these actions came yesterday evening pretty unprompted, although talking with White House [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=118.5s)]
*  officials after all these announcements and executive orders came out, they said this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=123.74s)]
*  was in the lineup all along. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=127.33999999999999s)]
*  It is pretty rare that these happened after the actual workday in the evening time, and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=129.1s)]
*  it felt as though a lot of them had just piled up kind of sweeping and changing the narrative [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=133.5s)]
*  that had kind of consumed Washington so far this week, which has been Musk's consistent [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=138.34s)]
*  attack of this mega bill. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=143.18s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it was striking and interesting, Jake, the fact that Republican senators on [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=144.66s)]
*  the Hill were asked about the resurgence of the travel ban in this new form, and they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=148.94s)]
*  basically said, oh, well, I don't actually think it's in response to what happened in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=153.86s)]
*  Boulder, Colorado, even though that's what the White House is saying. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  Even they said they knew that this was coming at some point. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=160.36s)]
*  Yeah, these types of things often happen whenever we see the White House move really quickly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=163.34s)]
*  And so the details of that are still parsed out and not entirely clear of the timing of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  all this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=171.74s)]
*  I was speaking with officials late last night who discussing the timing of this, they said [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=173.3s)]
*  exactly what you did. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=176.82000000000002s)]
*  That Boulder was the reason this was amplified and hurried up. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  And we talked to people on the Hill. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=181.3s)]
*  They say that's not the case. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  It reminds me of when the trade minister was in an actual hearing on the Hill whenever [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=184.02s)]
*  tariffs rapidly change. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=190.66000000000003s)]
*  And he was asked in real time, did you know that this has changed? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  And he was not made completely aware. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=194.78s)]
*  The White House often moves in a very kind of quick, speedy and sometimes not fully communicative [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=196.58s)]
*  way here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=201.18s)]
*  That seems to be the case and we're going to continue to get a readout on that throughout [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=202.62s)]
*  the day. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, of course, especially because you're right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=205.70000000000002s)]
*  These executive orders are typically signed with some kind of press access, even if it's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=207.5s)]
*  just for the pool. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=211.78s)]
*  The president likes to talk through these. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=213.06s)]
*  Usually this is different, even though, again, the White House and other people on Capitol [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=215.06s)]
*  Hill are saying, yeah, we had some sense that something like this was coming. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=219.74s)]
*  Of course, the fact that it comes against this backdrop is notable, of course, Jake, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=223.78s)]
*  because Elon Musk is ramping up his criticism of President Trump's legislative agenda, calling [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=227.62s)]
*  on senators to kill the bill like the seminal bill that will do all of their policy items. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=232.22s)]
*  In a series of social media posts yesterday, the Tesla CEO tried to rally Republicans against [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  the legislation, urging voters to call their senators and congressmen, writing, quote, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=241.9s)]
*  bankrupting America is not OK. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=246.38s)]
*  Musk also suggested drafting a new bill that won't add to the national debt. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=248.98s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=252.7s)]
*  What? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=253.7s)]
*  Like it's hard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=254.7s)]
*  The comments mark what appears to be an escalation in the rift between Musk and the Trump administration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=255.7s)]
*  One senior White House official telling NBC News President Trump is now considering how [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=259.18s)]
*  and when to respond, adding that he was, quote, caught off guard, but not entirely surprised [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=262.58s)]
*  by Musk's opposition. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson had this to say. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=268.94s)]
*  Elon and I left on a great note. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=273.3s)]
*  We were texting one another, you know, happy texts, you know, Monday. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  And then and then yesterday, you know, 24 hours later, he does a 180 and he comes out [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=278.44s)]
*  and opposed the bill. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=283.18s)]
*  And it surprised me, frankly. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=284.18s)]
*  I think he's he's flat wrong. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=285.38s)]
*  I think he's he's way off on this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  And I've told him as much and I've said it publicly and privately. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=288.94s)]
*  I'm very consistent in that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=291.62s)]
*  But am I concerned about the effect of this on the midterms? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=293.26s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=295.82s)]
*  Let me tell you why, because when the big beautiful bill is done and signed into law, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=296.82s)]
*  every single American is going to do better. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=300.1s)]
*  We're going to watch that theory get tested in real time. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=303.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the upper chamber, some Republican senators are not taking Musk's criticism lightly, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  asking him to be a little more specific, too. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  I can't respond to generalities. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=313.3s)]
*  If you want to talk about specific provisions in the bill and solutions for it, I mean, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  this is somebody who has got a lot of insight into the U.S. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=319.14s)]
*  government over the last six months. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=322.86s)]
*  Give us some productive feedback that we can operate on. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=324.26s)]
*  I can't operate on platitudes or I can't respond to platitudes. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=326.5s)]
*  We should just say what he what he thinks. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=330.62s)]
*  Look, I think Mr. Musk, I'm a big Musk fan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  I think he's really smart. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  I think he's entitled to his opinion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=338.86s)]
*  He's frustrated. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=341.86s)]
*  I think he believes in my judgment correctly that we're quickly becoming debt slaves, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=342.94s)]
*  that Congress needs to to rearm the magical healing power of no. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=349.94s)]
*  And I agree with him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=357.34s)]
*  Having said that, I'm not ready to throw in the towel on this bill. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=359.1s)]
*  Interesting comments there. And we're going to hear directly from Senator Kennedy in just a little while when he joins Morning Joe this morning. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=363.98s)]
*  But a new estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finds that President Trump's tax and spending bill would do as Musk and others fear, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=370.14s)]
*  add two point four trillion dollars to the national debt over the next 10 years. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=377.94s)]
*  The simple math on the bill projects a loss of three point seven trillion dollars in tax revenue while cutting net spending by one point three trillion dollars. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=381.7s)]
*  The budget office also estimated that nearly 11 million people would lose their health insurance by 2034 because of spending cuts and new eligibility rules under Medicaid. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=389.62s)]
*  The new budget projection factors in a series of last minute revisions that Republican leaders made to placate holdouts before the House passed the legislation last month. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=398.94s)]
*  So, Jake, how are your sources parsing through this moment? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=407.97999999999996s)]
*  And what do they think from a White House perspective? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=411.9s)]
*  The ultimate impact on senators and this legislation is going to be because of Musk. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=414.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Ali, that's the question that is on every White House official's mind right now is how impactful is this actually going to be to the vote? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=420.46s)]
*  I spoke with a lot of White House officials yesterday. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=427.66s)]
*  It's funny, they kept trying to tell me that President Trump was not taking this personally. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=430.14s)]
*  I then talked to other folks who said that's exactly how he's taking it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  That's how he takes these types of things. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=437.7s)]
*  Another official was telling me that this is not entirely surprising, as we've heard, because ultimately Musk was a special government employee for a month and in some ways had to go along with his boss, Donald Trump, on some things. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=440.38s)]
*  He's now getting a chance to air some of those grievances or some of those disagreements, and he's doing that from, obviously, his very public profile. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=453.38s)]
*  Musk is kind of the monster that Trump created. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  He gave him a lot of this authority and potential influence, and now he's exerting some of that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  Most of the officials are telling me that they don't believe this actually has the power. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=468.46s)]
*  Musk's criticism doesn't have the power to sink the bill. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=472.78s)]
*  It's not that it's not going to go through anymore. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=475.78s)]
*  They still say they feel very confident about that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=478.9s)]
*  What it does, most importantly though, is it gives some of these Republican holdouts that the Josh Hollies and others who already are showing some hesitancy towards supporting this bill. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  What it does is it gives them more and more opportunity to dig their heels in, and ultimately it might end up having to make the White House give certain concessions to these senators that they weren't planning on doing in the first place. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=491.46000000000004s)]
*  So it doesn't entirely sink the bill, they say, but it does frustrate them, and that's clear from some of the response yesterday. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=503.02000000000004s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=508.22s)]
*  I mean, it definitely shakes the turf on Capitol Hill. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=509.22s)]
*  What I think some people on the House side were expecting to be minimal changes from the Senate. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  Now they are bolstered in their ability to make some, and the White House may have to give them that cover because of Elon Musk. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=516.26s)]
*  And then once again, it leaves House Republicans in the position that many of them were worried about, which is defending on the campaign trail the most, we could say, extreme version of this bill. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=522.86s)]
*  And they're going to still have to take that back to their constituents after defending Musk and Doge for all of these months in front of angry town halls. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=532.22s)]
*  Jake Traylor, thank you, as always, for coming on. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=539.98s)]
*  We appreciate your reporting. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  A lot to cover here. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJiFBoFdZHQ&t=543.58s)]
