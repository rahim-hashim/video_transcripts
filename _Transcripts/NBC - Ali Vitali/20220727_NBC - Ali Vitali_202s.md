# Rev. Al: People Need To Read 'The Big Lie' To Understand Where We're At And How We Go Forward
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE)
*  Sir, Reverend Sharpton, we appreciate you helping talk about my new book out now called [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=0.0s)]
*  The Big Lie. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=6.04s)]
*  But I wanted to ask you something specific about it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=7.04s)]
*  It traces the origin of Trump's lies that, of course, fueled the violence on January [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  6th. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  But January 6th is only the midway point of the book. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=16.04s)]
*  And the lies have shaped so much of our politics since. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=17.68s)]
*  We have seen Republicans use it as cover to change laws in states across the country that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=20.8s)]
*  restrict access to the ballot. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=26.72s)]
*  And Democrats gave it a shot but failed to pass federal voting rights protections. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=28.84s)]
*  Where do you see now the aftershocks of Trump's lie? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=35.4s)]
*  And what can Democrats do to protect the ballot? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me say that when I first received your book, I was glad to receive [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=41.84s)]
*  it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=49.4s)]
*  Your colleague of mine, I've known you since you were a young reporter in New York, one [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=50.4s)]
*  of the tabloids. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=56.04s)]
*  So, of course, I want to read your book. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=57.24s)]
*  But after reading it, I think it will be the definitive book of this era. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=59.6s)]
*  You know, it's one of those books that we read now about the Lincoln era. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  I think you really defined in better detail than anyone I've seen what the big lie is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=67.84s)]
*  and its implications. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=75.56s)]
*  And that addresses your question. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=77.52s)]
*  I think that the politics that we're in now was defined by the big lie. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  We are defined in the Republican Party whether you are advocates of the big lie or not. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=85.54s)]
*  And that is ushered in a 50-50 Senate, in some cases a close House race. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=92.18s)]
*  That is all based on the big lie. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=98.54s)]
*  And I think in order to understand where we're going in the midterm elections, look at the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=101.34s)]
*  nominee in Pennsylvania, one who participated in the insurrection. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  The books in this era right now, this immediate era, is defined by the big lie. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=112.1s)]
*  And your book explained it, exposed it, detailed it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=117.38s)]
*  It is important. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=121.82s)]
*  It's a must-read. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=122.82s)]
*  And I'm not saying that because you're a colleague of mine and because you used to write in tabloids [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=123.82s)]
*  about me, because some of it wasn't positive. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=129.74s)]
*  No, that's, I'm just kidding. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=131.82s)]
*  Because I really think it's definitive, and people need to read this book to understand [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=134.82s)]
*  where we're at and how we go forward. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=140.14s)]
*  Well, Rev, I've always been a straight shooter, including on coverage of you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=142.54s)]
*  But I appreciate the kind words about the book. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=146.82s)]
*  But there's no question that right now Trump's lie impacting this 2022 election and certainly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  will play a major role in 2024. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=153.94s)]
*  Reverend Al Sharpton, we really appreciate you being on this morning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=157.14s)]
*  We will speak to you again soon. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=159.06s)]
*  And as a reminder, my book is indeed out this week entitled the book, The Big Lie, available [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=165.26s)]
*  And I'll be talking about it tonight here in New York City at the 92nd Street Y in conversation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=166.26s)]
*  with the immortal Mike Barnacle. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=169.86s)]
*  So if you're in New York, please buy tickets, show up. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=172.58s)]
*  If you're not in New York, buy tickets, then buy a plane ticket, come to New York. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=176.38000000000002s)]
*  We'll see you tonight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=180.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfyDsiyW3uE&t=181.86s)]
