# Sen. Scott travels to Iowa amid 2024 buzz
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8)
*  Joining us now from Des Moines, Iowa, national political reporter for Politico, Natalie [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=0.0s)]
*  Allison. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=5.0s)]
*  Natalie, morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=6.0s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=7.0s)]
*  Let's start with the polling. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=8.0s)]
*  President Biden, of course, has not formally announced his reelection campaign. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=10.68s)]
*  Aides close to him say fully intends to run, but he probably won't make an official decision [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=14.72s)]
*  for another month or two. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=19.12s)]
*  But if you are the White House and Democrats, you've got to be pretty pleased with the trend [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=21.12s)]
*  on that poll, do you not? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=26.36s)]
*  Yeah, they have to be. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=28.96s)]
*  And I can tell you here in Iowa, the candidates on the Republican side are campaigning against [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=30.64s)]
*  him. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=35.08s)]
*  At Tim Scott's two speeches yesterday in Des Moines, at Nikki Haley's events on Monday [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=36.08s)]
*  and Tuesday, both of them are making the case against Biden. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=41.4s)]
*  They aren't even really discussing the possibility that a fresher face could be on the Democratic [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=44.6s)]
*  ticket next year. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=49.56s)]
*  So let's talk about Tim Scott. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=51.58s)]
*  You're there in Iowa covering it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=52.82s)]
*  It certainly seems like this Faith in America listening tour is a soft launch for a presidential [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=54.36s)]
*  run. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=60.24s)]
*  What would be his theory of the case, Tim Scott, and how is he hoping to introduce himself [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=61.56s)]
*  to a national audience? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=66.6s)]
*  Well, it certainly is another public sign that Tim Scott is running a confirmation of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=68.48s)]
*  things that those of us reporting on this know that, yes, he is taking all of the right [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=73.52s)]
*  steps to set up a presidential campaign to launch sometime later this spring. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=79.1s)]
*  He's going about it in a subtle way, similarly to Nikki Haley. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=85.2s)]
*  He is not attacking Trump directly. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=87.76s)]
*  Tim Scott is someone who is saying he is going to portray his candidacy as one of optimism. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=90.56s)]
*  He is set on painting a picture of America where people of various factions and stripes [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=96.12s)]
*  can get along. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=103.68s)]
*  That's the tenor of his campaign. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=105.44s)]
*  It is not one about openly lashing out at fellow Americans. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  He is criticizing the Democrats for the state of the country, but he is pivoting to trying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  to portray an America where young people have opportunity. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=119.86s)]
*  That's what he was saying yesterday at a college campus. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  It's not unlike the message that Nikki Haley is delivering at this time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=128.18s)]
*  Neither of them are going after Trump directly. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  Nikki Haley, of course, has called for competency test for politicians 75 and older. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=133.78s)]
*  That is the closest thing she has done to Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=141.38s)]
*  That's going to be something that all Republicans have to navigate, how you deal with Trump [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=144.82s)]
*  without alienating all of his supporters. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=149.98s)]
*  At least for now, polling suggests that whether it's Haley or Tim Scott, Mike Pompeo, or [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=152.46s)]
*  all polling in low single digits, there has only been one real alternative to Trump so [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=158.14s)]
*  far who puts up a pretty good number, and that's Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  Has there been any update as to what the timeline is for his potential decision as to whether [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=165.38s)]
*  he'll jump in or not? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=170.22000000000003s)]
*  You know, he is continuing to signal that he is not making any moves until after the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=172.22000000000003s)]
*  conclusion of the Florida legislative session later this spring, so that wouldn't be something [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  until probably after April, and it seems like there is a bit of a waiting game among others [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=181.74s)]
*  in the field. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=187.74s)]
*  Certainly, Tim Scott himself isn't pulling the trigger yet. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=188.74s)]
*  We had Vivek Ramaswamy get in the race this week, and he's also out in Iowa at the end [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  of the week. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=197.46s)]
*  Folks like Mike Pence, folks like Mike Pompeo, even former Arkansas Governor Issa Hutchinson, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=199.06s)]
*  who's also making the rounds. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=203.94s)]
*  There's a little bit of a hurry up and wait aspect to their candidacies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=206.3s)]
*  They are sort of waiting to see the field at this point. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  There's arguments for and against that, and certainly a number of them can't actually [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=212.46s)]
*  raise federal funds until they launch a campaign, which would put them in a pretty difficult [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=215.38s)]
*  spot with folks like Trump, DeSantis, even Tim Scott, who have a lot of money that they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  could tap into pretty quickly. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, really good point there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=227.9s)]
*  Frozen field on both sides for the moment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=228.9s)]
*  National Political Reporter for Politico, Natalie Allison, thank you for getting up early and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  starting your day with us. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=234.22s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4rmzx2xOn8&t=235.22s)]
