# Supreme Court to hear Colorado ballot case today
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM)
*  The Supreme Court this very morning will hear oral arguments on Donald Trump's eligibility to appear on the ballot. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=0.0s)]
*  Back in December, you'll recall that Colorado's state Supreme Court ruled that he should be removed from that state's ballot [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=7.34s)]
*  based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=14.22s)]
*  That post-Civil War provision of the Constitution bars anyone who took an oath as a member of Congress [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=18.34s)]
*  or as an officer of the United States and engaged in insurrection from ever holding public office again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=25.38s)]
*  Trump's legal team is expected to argue that as president, he was not an officer of the United States [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  and that his actions leading up to and on January 6th do not constitute an insurrection or rebellion. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Joining us now, MSNBC Justice and Legal Affairs analyst Anthony Coley. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  He was most recently the top spokesperson at the Department of Justice under Attorney General Merrick Garland. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=52.38s)]
*  Anthony, good to see you this morning. So let's get your takeaways. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=58.88s)]
*  What you're looking to see today, it's a monumental case because it's not just about Colorado. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=62.88s)]
*  There are a number of other states looking potentially to do the same thing, so there could be a domino effect. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=68.38s)]
*  So what are some things you're going to be really looking out for? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=72.88s)]
*  That's right. Good morning, Jonathan. It is a monumental case. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=75.38s)]
*  And I think the big question before the court is, will it be the apolitical branch of government that really calls balls and strikes as they are? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=77.88s)]
*  Or will it rely on one of these technical legal arguments, one of these off-ramps that your guests earlier this week have talked about? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=90.38s)]
*  I suspect that given the conservative majority of the court that it's going to take one of these narrow off-ramps. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=101.38s)]
*  But I should say, Jonathan, we have seen this. We've seen this movie before. This is the same type of play. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=107.38s)]
*  If they take this off-ramp, this is the same play that Senate Republicans used during the second Trump impeachment trial, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=112.88s)]
*  when instead of voting their conscience, if they had voted to convict Donald Trump for what he did on January 6, he wouldn't even be on the ballot right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=121.38s)]
*  So I suspect, Jonathan, at the end of the day, it's going to come down to the American people doing what the American people did in 2020, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=131.88s)]
*  and that is to decisively beat Donald Trump at the ballot box. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=140.38s)]
*  So tell us a little bit how today will play out and what we'll hear. It is going to be live streamed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=144.88s)]
*  So walk us through the procedures. So much of America is going to be closely watching and listening. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=152.38s)]
*  That's exactly right. The narrow question before the court, as your segment teases, is one of eligibility [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=159.38s)]
*  and whether or not Donald Trump, as an officer of the United States, engaged in an insurrection. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=164.88s)]
*  And what the plaintiffs say is that, of course he did. We all saw Donald Trump summon the mob, his supporters, to Washington. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=170.88s)]
*  We saw them egg them on. We saw Trump encourage his supporters to go down to the Capitol and to fight like hell. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=179.38s)]
*  And we all remember the results of that. They defaced the Capitol. They assaulted the news media. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=187.88s)]
*  They assaulted law enforcement. Five members of law enforcement lost their lives. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=194.88s)]
*  I suspect that we're going to hear a lot of that today. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=199.38s)]
*  Now, Trump, on his other side, one of his main arguments, and your tease here had it right, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=203.38s)]
*  is that he wasn't even technically an officer of the United States. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=208.38s)]
*  It's so, you know, who knows how this is going to shake out, but I strongly suspect that it's really going to come down to the American people, Jonathan, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=213.88s)]
*  doing what they did in the last election, and that is decisively beating Trump at the ballot box. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=223.88s)]
*  It seems unlikely the Supreme Court will take him off the ballot, but we will certainly have complete coverage of this all day long here on MSNBC. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=228.88s)]
*  Anthony, before you go, one other matter. Your former boss, Merrick Garland, sent a letter to some congressional leaders yesterday [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=235.88s)]
*  saying that the DOJ's investigation into President Biden's classified documents case has wrapped up. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=240.88s)]
*  These are documents he had when he was vice president. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=246.88s)]
*  There are not expected to be any criminal charges, maybe some political embarrassment, but tell us how this will play out over the next couple of days. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=249.88s)]
*  Yeah, no surprises here. Listen, Jonathan, we all make mistakes. The question is, what do you do when you make a mistake? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=256.88s)]
*  And what Joe Biden and his team did here is they immediately notify the National Archives when these documents were found. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=263.88s)]
*  They returned the documents and then they cooperated with investigators and prosecutors who were assigned to look at this whole thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=272.88s)]
*  So completely no surprise here. I suspect that over the coming days, we are going to see people on the Republican side try to draw a distinction, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=281.88s)]
*  a parallel between what happened here and what the same type of matter in Donald Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=291.88s)]
*  But there really is no comparison, Jonathan. What Joe Biden did and what Donald Trump did with regard to classified material, it really is night and day. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=297.88s)]
*  So I suspect we're going to see Republicans try to draw some type of parallel here, but the facts suggest that there really is no parallel. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=309.88s)]
*  Yeah, that can't be said enough. There is no comparison between what Biden and Trump did here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=318.88s)]
*  MSNBC Justice and Legal Affairs Analyst Anthony Coley, thank you so very much. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=324.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mumecztMzKM&t=348.88s)]
