# Columbia protesters occupy campus building
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY)
*  And we'll begin this morning with the growing unrest at Columbia University. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=0.0s)]
*  Overnight, pro-Palestinian student protesters occupied a campus building. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=4.8s)]
*  It's Hamilton Hall, the same building that students took over back in the 1960s. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=10.0s)]
*  That building, just a few hundred feet away from the Gaza encampment site. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=14.5s)]
*  It came just hours after the university began suspending students who refused to leave that encampment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=19.3s)]
*  The tents have been up for nearly two weeks, and the university wants to clear the area before graduation, scheduled for May 15th. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=27.2s)]
*  The protesters held a press conference yesterday afternoon, saying the university has not made significant concessions to their main demands. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=35.7s)]
*  The group wants Columbia to divest from companies with links to the Israeli occupation of Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=44.7s)]
*  The students also claim Columbia has stopped negotiations. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=52.2s)]
*  As a result, they say they will, quote, not be moved unless by force. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=56.2s)]
*  And as we keep an eye on the situation there uptown here in Manhattan, protests are also escalating at other college campuses. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=63.2s)]
*  At the University of Texas, protesters clashed with police, resulting in dozens of arrests. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=70.2s)]
*  Video shows officers in riot gear dragging and carrying out demonstrators. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=76.7s)]
*  The university says at least 40 people were taken into custody yesterday for trespassing and disorderly conduct. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=82.2s)]
*  Many of those people were not affiliated with the school. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=89.2s)]
*  That's a phenomenon happening at Columbia as well. They're not all students. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=92.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, at the University of Utah, police were called to disperse a crowd of protesters there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=96.2s)]
*  The university says 17 people were arrested last night and one officer was injured. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=102.7s)]
*  A hatchet was also confiscated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=107.7s)]
*  The number of arrests at campuses nationwide is now approaching about a thousand people. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=110.7s)]
*  We will have more on this developing story throughout the morning here on MSNBC. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=116.7s)]
*  you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnznE-2ruY&t=132.2s)]
