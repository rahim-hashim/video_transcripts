**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg)
*  Welcome back. There was more emotional testimony during day four of the Sean [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=0.0s)]
*  Diddy Combs trial. Plus Netflix re-upped some fan favorites and Morgan Wallen [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=6.0s)]
*  finally weighs in about that SNL exit. NBC News Entertainment correspondent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=10.76s)]
*  Chloe Malas joins me live with those headlines and more. Chloe. Hey Ali, happy [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=15.48s)]
*  Friday and good morning. First up Cassie Ventura. She's back on the stand for her [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=21.64s)]
*  second day of cross examination by Sean Diddy Combs' legal team. I've been [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=26.0s)]
*  inside that courthouse and I can tell you that the defense is trying to poke [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=30.8s)]
*  holes in her allegations. She was forced to take part in these drug-fueled sex [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=34.32s)]
*  parties known as freak-offs. His team showing text messages like this one from [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=39.56s)]
*  Cassie writing in 2009 to Combs after they had been dating for two years, quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=44.84s)]
*  I'm always ready to freak off. And another in 2017 in which she said that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=49.28s)]
*  she loved those sexual encounters, she claims that Combs controlled and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=53.6s)]
*  coerced her. There's also been a lot of heated back and forth, Ali, about the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=57.68s)]
*  length of the cross examination. Prosecutors, they want Ventura off the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=61.8s)]
*  stand by the end of the day today because they think that she could give [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  birth as early as this weekend. She is currently pregnant with her third child. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=69.56s)]
*  Also Combs has pleaded not guilty. And Netflix, they've just announced that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=74.08s)]
*  they are renewing some of their most popular shows. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=79.8s)]
*  Howdy, young lady. Could I trouble you for the next dance? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=85.0s)]
*  That's right. You guessed it. Richardson, they're coming back, but not just for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=91.2s)]
*  one, but two more seasons. And if you're in a political scandal, which I bet you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=95.16s)]
*  are, buckle up because the diplomat starring Carrie Russell, they're getting a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  fourth season. And speaking of four seasons, that series created by funny [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=104.84s)]
*  lady Tina Fey, they're getting a second swing too. And if you haven't seen it, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=110.2s)]
*  it is based on the 1981 film directed by and starring Alan Alda. It's one of my [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=114.0s)]
*  favorite movies. Okay, I'm dating myself now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=119.4s)]
*  Watch four seasons yet, but I am an avid Bridgerton viewer, so I'm kind of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=123.12s)]
*  burning for those new seasons. But I got to do some binge watching here, I think [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=127.4s)]
*  because I don't think I'm caught up. The last time I saw it, I think the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=131.04s)]
*  characters were in very different places. Chloe, I don't know. But I also [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=134.28s)]
*  want to ask you about this moment back in March, right there where you are at [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=137.68s)]
*  30 Rock watch. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=142.04s)]
*  Thank you so much to Morgan Wallen. I had a wonderful time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=144.52s)]
*  So Morgan Wallen's finally addressing his controversial SNL exit. The country [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=156.12s)]
*  music star says his decision to abruptly walk off the set at the end of the show [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=161.08s)]
*  during the credits was not because he was mad at anyone apparently, but rather [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  he was just quote, ready to go home because he'd been there all week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=168.82000000000002s)]
*  Wallen was the musical guest on the March 29th episode with host Mikey [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  Madison. And as the clock struck one a.m., he skedaddled off the stage after [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=176.56s)]
*  almost immediately after Madison signed off. Traditionally, the musical guest [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=180.96s)]
*  and post remain on stage to mingle with the cast. But then after his exit, the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=185.4s)]
*  most memeable post posting a photo of a plane on Instagram writing Get me to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=190.36s)]
*  God's country. The phrase quickly went viral. Chloe, what was your favorite of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  the of the Get me to God's country memes? There were some very Capitol Hill [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=200.12s)]
*  centric ones that made it for the Hill Press Corral. I mean, I just have to say, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=203.16000000000003s)]
*  you know, so many people love Morgan Wallen. They love his music and a lot of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=206.72000000000003s)]
*  people, you know, they point out his controversies. But after, you know, a lot [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  of his fans are rallying behind him for coming out this week and explaining that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=215.8s)]
*  sort of bizarre, cringy moment at the end of us at L. But that was one of the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=220.04s)]
*  water cooler moments from this week. But listen, I gotta go because I gotta get [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=223.8s)]
*  down to the courthouse to get inside for the Sean Diddy Combs trial. And that is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=227.64s)]
*  what's buzzing in the entertainment world. So you're all caught up for the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=232.88s)]
*  weekend, Ali. Thank you, Chloe. So appreciate you coming in. You've been [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=236.36s)]
*  doing really great work covering the trial to keep it up. We're watching [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQa00bOifNg&t=239.92000000000002s)]
