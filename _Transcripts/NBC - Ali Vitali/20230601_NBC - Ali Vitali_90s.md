# Dee-Santis or Deh-Santis? His team won't say
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8)
*  of the Florida governor. We've been sort of documenting here on morning Joe that he has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=0.0s)]
*  gone back and forth as to how he pronounces his last name, whether it's DeSantis or DeSantis. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=4.08s)]
*  Axios is looking into this important matter. What'd you find? Yeah, our deep investigation [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=10.16s)]
*  that there is no easy answer into this that the governor has flip flop back and forth. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=14.48s)]
*  In a prior campaign, it was more DeSantis. That was a campaign spokesman said. So we reached out [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  to the campaign this year. We reached out to his pack this year. We haven't gotten an answer in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=25.04s)]
*  some of his interviews. He has flipped forth back and forth, and it's different in how he [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=29.44s)]
*  speaks to some reporters. It's different in some of the campaign ads. It's different in how his [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  aides say it. It's not a huge blockbuster issue, but it's, I think, a very interesting way. And I [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=37.68s)]
*  think it speaks a little bit to the way the DeSantis campaign's interactions with the press, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=42.56s)]
*  not being able to explain this or have something on it. And of course, as we mentioned earlier, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  it's another source of attack for the former president Trump spokesman telling us that Ron [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=50.24s)]
*  DeSantis is so phony he can't even figure out how to pronounce his last name. So I'm sure the Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  war room is cutting different clips of that, ready to let those go on social media. And we assume the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=60.08s)]
*  Florida governor's first name is Ron, even though Trump keeps calling him Rob. So one more thing here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=64.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkkXj13-hM8&t=85.12s)]
