# Rep. Comer on Hunter Biden's not guilty plea: 'It doesn't impact my investigation'
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU)
*  House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer was asked yesterday about how Hunter Biden's surprise not guilty plea could impact his panels ongoing investigations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's some of what he had to say to reporters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=10.64s)]
*  It doesn't impact my investigation because the Department of Justice and FBI haven't done a darn thing to help me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=13.36s)]
*  So I think, you know, what I've tried to say, and I know this is confusing, there's really two investigations now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=19.44s)]
*  There's the crime, which House Oversight is investigating, and there's the cover-up. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=25.44s)]
*  Which a multitude of committees are involved in. The cover-up would be the DOJ giving him a sweetheart plea deal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=29.84s)]
*  The DOJ not charging him for money laundering or violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act or racketeering or tax evasion. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=37.44s)]
*  Let's note that there hasn't been evidence provided for some of those claims. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Joining us now, national political reporter for Politico, Natalie Allison. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=49.6s)]
*  Natalie, great to see you this morning. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=54.16s)]
*  I mean, it is obviously Hunter Biden in front of mind for so many in the political world right now after that plea deal fell apart in stunning fashion yesterday. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=55.76s)]
*  But you've got some new reporting about how Republicans are viewing the entire saga. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=62.16s)]
*  And we keep hearing from the likes of Comer and others who have made, frankly, Hunter Biden the primary mission of their lives, it seems. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=66.32s)]
*  But not all Republicans feel that way. Walk us through it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=73.36s)]
*  That's right. There's clearly an appetite to do this right now among some Republicans. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=75.84s)]
*  We have Donald Trump, who is for all intents and purposes still the standard bearer of the Republican Party, calling for this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=79.28s)]
*  We have the House Speaker saying, yeah, actually, this is something we might do. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=85.2s)]
*  But even McCarthy himself sort of walked back the the eminence of this impeachment inquiry happening, what a lot of people interpreted earlier in the week. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=88.56s)]
*  And then we spoke to Congressman Richard Hudson. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=97.04s)]
*  He is the the chair of the House Republican campaign arm. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=100.08s)]
*  He's from a swing state in North Carolina. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=103.44s)]
*  And he said, when we go back home, people are talking about Hunter Biden. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=106.0s)]
*  They're talking about crime. They're talking about the economy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=109.2s)]
*  This is probably not what we need to be focusing on right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  We spoke with another congressman, a Republican from Texas, Roger Williams, who said, sure, I think Biden deserves to be impeached. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=114.96s)]
*  He probably does. But that being said, this is just not the message that's going to move us forward. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=121.52s)]
*  That's going to get us the White House in twenty four. That's going to help us win back the Senate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=126.72s)]
*  You talk to Republican strategists and their quick dimension. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=130.8s)]
*  In 1998, when House Republicans move forward with an impeachment inquiry against Bill Clinton, that public polling shows was not really that popular with the general public. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=133.92s)]
*  They did pay a price for it, at least the House Republicans did. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=144.96s)]
*  They thought there might be this this massive, you know, twenty thirty seat gain that year. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  They actually lost seats. And so it's a cautionary tale for Republicans. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=152.24s)]
*  We are still seeing a number of them showing some trepidation about jumping on this so fast in this election. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=156.4s)]
*  Well, polling backs up that viewpoint. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=163.12s)]
*  The most Americans simply don't really care that much about what's happening with Hunter Biden. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=164.72000000000003s)]
*  And obviously all the talk and the investigations into the Biden family shadowing the presidential campaign, which is underway. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  And you're heading to Iowa later tonight ahead of seeing a couple of candidates while you're there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=177.84s)]
*  And then tomorrow's annual Lincoln dinner, which a number of Republicans hopefuls, including Donald Trump, are expected to attend. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  What are you expecting? Yeah, that's a big deal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=188.4s)]
*  So so far we've seen a few of these confabs, cattle calls, if you will. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Although the Republican candidates have been there for the most part, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  but a lot of times they've been spread across two days, something like that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=198.4s)]
*  This is all of the field minus Chris Christie, who's essentially skipping Iowa. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=202.0s)]
*  He just isn't bothering with Iowa. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  He knows it's not not worth his time is is literally what he and his campaign says minus him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=207.52s)]
*  Everyone is going to be there. They're all going to be on the same stage. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=212.88s)]
*  Ten minutes slots. I'm told they're going to be held in separate rooms in the back to, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=215.52s)]
*  I guess, avoid any kind of awkward interactions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=220.32s)]
*  Both Trump and DeSantis will be there. We'll have everyone else there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  And this is really a time, I guess, to read the room and to see how people who attend state party events in Iowa, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=226.32000000000002s)]
*  because it is a sold out crowd, you know, 1500 or so people, how they're going to respond. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=233.84s)]
*  This comes on the heels of Trump, of course, essentially stubbing the Iowa governor, saying, you know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  she she should have endorsed him and he's the one who got her her current job. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=244.88s)]
*  And so it's going to be interesting to see how a state party people who really like Governor Kim Reynolds [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=249.84s)]
*  are going to respond to Trump on the stage at their party function. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=255.68s)]
*  And, you know, there's no reason to believe they won't give him resounding applause because that's what he gets pretty much any time [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=259.68s)]
*  he walks into the room of Republican Party faithful. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=265.76s)]
*  And there's certainly some Republicans are going all in on Iowa. Tim Scott, Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=268.64s)]
*  And we should also note that might be one of the first times we hear from Donald Trump after another indictment, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=272.8s)]
*  if that does indeed come down this week. National Political Reporter for Politico, Nat Alson. Safe travels. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=277.44s)]
*  Thank you. Enjoy Iowa and the dinner. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZW7LaIsTKU&t=282.88s)]
