# VP Harris to meet with member of Israeli war cabinet
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8)
*  Negotiators believe Hamas and Israel are slowly making progress, saying a ceasefire and hostage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=0.0s)]
*  release deal could be reached before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=6.44s)]
*  An Israeli and U.S. official tells the Wall Street Journal that Israel has agreed to the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=11.86s)]
*  broad outlines of a deal that includes a six-week truce. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=16.04s)]
*  But officials say Hamas has yet to provide answers on two key sticking points, which [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=19.92s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners the group wants freed by Israel and how many for each hostage released. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=24.4s)]
*  Because of that, Israel has not yet sent a senior delegation to Cairo for the ongoing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=35.44s)]
*  Members of Hamas are there already. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=37.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is set to meet with a member of Israel's war [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=39.68s)]
*  cabinet today at the White House. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=43.66s)]
*  This, just one day after Harris, called for an immediate ceasefire in the war in Gaza. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  She made the comments during the memorial events yesterday in Selma, Alabama, saying [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=50.82s)]
*  Israel must do more to protect the civilians there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=55.660000000000004s)]
*  It was her most forceful assessment of the conflict to date. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=59.14s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=62.78s)]
*  The conditions are inhumane. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=69.34s)]
*  And our common humanity compels us to act. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=73.9s)]
*  The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=80.06s)]
*  No excuses. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  They must open new border crossings. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  They must not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the delivery of aid. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=93.34s)]
*  They must ensure humanitarian personnel, sites and convoys are not targeted. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=99.14s)]
*  And they must work to restore basic services and promote order in Gaza so more food, water [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=106.22s)]
*  and fuel can reach those in need. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=114.14s)]
*  I will repeat, the threat of Hamas poses to the people of Israel must be eliminated. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=119.62s)]
*  And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=128.94s)]
*  For at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=138.94s)]
*  At the same time, the United States has made its first airdrops of humanitarian aid into [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=149.46s)]
*  In a combined effort with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, the United States Air Force dropped [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=155.34s)]
*  over 38,000 meals on Saturday afternoon. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=160.26s)]
*  The packages were stacked on palates for central Gaza where thousands of people are starving. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=164.06s)]
*  U.S. officials say they are looking into new ways to send more aid into Gaza, including [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=170.18s)]
*  by sea. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=174.94s)]
*  Joining us now, national security reporter for Politico, Alex Ward. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=176.82s)]
*  He is the author of the new book titled, The Internationalists, the Fight to Restore [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=180.94s)]
*  American Foreign Policy After Trump. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=185.82s)]
*  It is on sale now and is terrific. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=187.66s)]
*  Pick up a copy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=190.14s)]
*  Alex, good to see you this morning. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=191.14s)]
*  Let's start with those airdrops. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=193.42s)]
*  The fact that the United States has to do this, airdrop aid into Gaza, considering sending [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=194.7s)]
*  aid by sea, what does that say about the relationship that Washington has with Israel, that President [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=199.26s)]
*  Biden has with Prime Minister Netanyahu, where they couldn't just get Israel to facilitate [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=204.78s)]
*  the food coming in? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, let's be honest. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  This is a sign of American either weakness or ineffectiveness in this conflict. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, at this point, the administration has been very clear that they wanted Israel [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  to open up basically all the crossings, allow as much aid and then truck convoys to get [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=221.56s)]
*  in. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=226.32s)]
*  But at this point, even though they've pushed pretty hard, they've gotten a few open, but [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=227.32s)]
*  not enough. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=231.32s)]
*  And so now you've got the U.S. airdropping in what is the most expensive and ineffective [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=232.32s)]
*  way to deliver aid, which, of course, the people in Gaza don't really care how it gets [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=236.46s)]
*  in. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=241.34s)]
*  They need it and they want it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=242.34s)]
*  But it shows that as much as President Biden and his team have been pushing Bibi Netanyahu [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=243.34s)]
*  and his team to do more, they just won't. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  So now the U.S. is doing this pretty dramatic move in order to get as much as possible in [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=250.72s)]
*  at this point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=255.82s)]
*  And what do we make of the call from the vice president yesterday for this immediate ceasefire [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  and some pretty stern words for Israel and the conditions they've allowed to materialize [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=262.38000000000005s)]
*  there in Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=267.54s)]
*  This feels like it's a part of the process of ratcheting up. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=269.76000000000005s)]
*  What made the Biden White House go there now? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=272.98s)]
*  It's unclear. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=276.98s)]
*  I mean, one aspect could be that the administration is finally fed up with Bibi Netanyahu and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=277.98s)]
*  his team because they're unable to add more humanitarian assistance into the country, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=283.18s)]
*  again, leading to the airdrops. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=287.22s)]
*  It could also be that the uncommitted vote in the Michigan Democratic primary was so [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=288.32s)]
*  high, right, about 13 percent, a hundred thousand people or so. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=292.52s)]
*  Maybe they finally felt that there's a political reckoning happening here that they actually [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=296.44s)]
*  need to address when it comes to what's happening in Gaza. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=300.2s)]
*  But ultimately, I mean, you've heard the administration talk for a long time about the need for a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=303.08s)]
*  pause and the deal that they're trying to work with Hamas and Israel, but they haven't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  really used ceasefire. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=312.24s)]
*  So the fact that Vice President Harris used ceasefire, literally the word, and you heard [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=313.4s)]
*  the reaction to it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is a massive boon to progressives and especially those organizing for at least [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  a significant pause to this war. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  It really signals a different stance in this administration, a stronger stance. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=327.56s)]
*  And it previews or at least puts Vice President Harris on quite an interesting footing ahead [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  of her meeting today with Benny Gantz, who is part of the war cabinet in Israel. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  And Alex, lastly and briefly, what do U.S. officials tell you in terms of the likelihood [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  of this deal, the ceasefire for hostages deal getting done in time for Ramadan just a week [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  or so away? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  It's looking better than it was, perhaps a little bit the end of last week, but no one [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=355.68s)]
*  is really overly confident. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=360.44s)]
*  I mean, everyone's sort of skeptical. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=362.24s)]
*  No deal is done until it's done. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=364.36s)]
*  The issue seems to be Hamas here, who hasn't really been responding to the latest objectives. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=367.04s)]
*  But I think if you would ask anyone privately, they say, yes, it's going to get done, but [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=373.52s)]
*  it might be down to the wire. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=377.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=379.44s)]
*  National Security Reporter for Politico, Alex Ward, thank you as always. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=380.44s)]
*  We will speak to you again soon. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXUML6Ndrl8&t=383.32s)]
