# Pence on Trump pardon talk: It's too early
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg)
*  Welcome back to Way Too Early. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=0.0s)]
*  2024 White House hopeful and former Vice President Mike Pence was asked whether or not he would [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  pardon former President Trump if Trump were to be convicted on federal charges. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=8.66s)]
*  Take a listen to Pence's answer. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=13.86s)]
*  These are serious charges. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=16.66s)]
*  And as I said, I can't defend what's been a defend what the president does deserve to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=19.02s)]
*  make his defense. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=22.62s)]
*  I had a standard rule. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=23.62s)]
*  I don't talk about hypotheticals. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=25.22s)]
*  Look, we don't know what the president's defense here is. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=27.1s)]
*  I think he's entitled to make his defense, entitled to have his day in court. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=30.540000000000003s)]
*  I think any conclusion by anyone running for the presidency of the United States that would [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=34.18s)]
*  prejudge the facts in this case or prejudge the investigation into President Biden or [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=39.42s)]
*  his family is premature. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=45.38s)]
*  Joining us now, senior NBC News national politics reporter Jonathan Allen, who we should note [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=49.22s)]
*  was in South Florida. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=54.74s)]
*  Last couple of days covering the Trump trial landed back in Washington after midnight last [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=56.38s)]
*  night and is here this morning. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=61.38s)]
*  We're deeply grateful. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=63.42s)]
*  I'm happy to be here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=64.42s)]
*  I hope that's coffee. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=67.42s)]
*  So let's talk about where things stand and let's just say, first of all, the idea of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=69.26s)]
*  a pardon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=72.78s)]
*  This is it's almost become a little bit of a litmus test in the Republican Party. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=73.78s)]
*  Vivek Ramesway, who is one of the lesser known candidates in the race, although he's done [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=76.78s)]
*  a pretty good job of entering the conversation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=80.1s)]
*  He even called everyone to have a pledge, commit one way or the other. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=82.78s)]
*  We just heard Pence sort of address it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=86.22s)]
*  Talk about how other candidates are doing so. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=89.22s)]
*  Well, you know, it's interesting you say litmus test, but also in some ways a dodge for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=91.22s)]
*  those who say I would pardon Donald Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  It's a way of them saying they think they're going to be president of the United States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=96.9s)]
*  And by the way, I don't think that he is guilty or even if he is guilty, he shouldn't be in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=99.78s)]
*  prison. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=103.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=104.9s)]
*  So it's a very like that's an easy position to take. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=105.9s)]
*  What Pence has just just did is a little bit harder of a position to take, I think. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=106.9s)]
*  But at the same time, Mike Pence, again, showing his incredible ability to say a lot of words [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=111.1s)]
*  without saying a lot. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=117.69999999999999s)]
*  It was certainly some real real word salad there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  It is reflective of that balancing act that we talk about a lot, right, where where these [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=121.02s)]
*  other candidates, of course, need to beat Donald Trump. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=126.66s)]
*  But they're so afraid of alienating the Trump voters who support they will need. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=129.38s)]
*  I mean, what kind of calculations are the campaigns making as to how to handle this? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=134.18s)]
*  I think their first, generally speaking, their first idea is how to beat Donald Trump. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=137.57999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=142.66s)]
*  For if you're dissent us and you're running in second and you think there's a real good [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=143.66s)]
*  chance that Donald Trump is going to fall out of this race and you know, you can be [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  anointed, then you have to really balance out for everybody else. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  They've got to figure out just how to get out of single digits, how to get out of low [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=153.14s)]
*  single digits. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=156.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=157.38s)]
*  So we showed some polling earlier this year to your point about low single digits. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=158.38s)]
*  You know, Trump's support, at least so far, suggested has not dropped really since the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  second indictment. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=166.58s)]
*  DeSantis is still 30 points behind him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=167.58s)]
*  Every other candidate is not 20 odd points behind DeSantis. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=170.34s)]
*  So just give us your sense of that race. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=173.38000000000002s)]
*  Do you see anything that could shift the dynamic between DeSantis and those that trail him? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's certainly possible that those who don't like Donald Trump will decide that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=181.70000000000002s)]
*  Ron DeSantis isn't their horse after watching him run and run and run and not get anywhere. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=185.86s)]
*  Perhaps they will move to someone else. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=190.74s)]
*  But who? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=192.22000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=193.22000000000003s)]
*  DeSantis has really shown that they are the world beater that's going to take on Donald [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=194.22s)]
*  Trump first and then beat Joe Biden, basically beat two presidents. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=199.06s)]
*  The audacity of the project of trying to beat two presidents is pretty amazing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=202.02s)]
*  And then you've got these guys trying to just break out of single digits. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=207.1s)]
*  But DeSantis has shown no traction. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=210.64s)]
*  Right now you've got to look at the Republican field and say, Donald Trump is still the dominant [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=212.7s)]
*  figure in the Republican Party, not only with a plurality, with a majority in most national [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=216.1s)]
*  polling. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=222.18s)]
*  And there's just some sense that maybe his support's a little softer this time around [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=223.18s)]
*  than last time, but it's not coming up in the polls, at least not yet. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=226.86s)]
*  Do we think, we just showed the list there, do we think the field is settled or is there [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=230.9s)]
*  another Republican who could jump in? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=234.3s)]
*  And I'm mostly thinking about Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=236.46s)]
*  Yeah, Youngkin has signaled that he's at least thinking about it, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  He has not totally ruled it out and may be waiting to see that DeSantis falls, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=244.34s)]
*  Basically all of Glenn Youngkin's team from his gubernatorial run is now working for Ron [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=250.34s)]
*  DeSantis in one capacity or another. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=254.78s)]
*  So I think he's counting on DeSantis to fall and then Trump to fall and then Biden to fall. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=256.42s)]
*  And he's sitting there in Virginia not far from here thinking about it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=264.18s)]
*  Yeah, before we let you go, just give us a quick sense, what's next for you? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=267.66s)]
*  What storylines you explore or travel you might be taking? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=270.66s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=272.54s)]
*  I think right now the real question is what happens with Trump and how does he try to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=273.54s)]
*  maintain what looks like a little bit of energy in his campaign? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=279.46s)]
*  You were talking earlier with Meredith McRaw about the fundraising. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  How does he keep that going while a trial drags on? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=285.94s)]
*  Yeah, we have never been here before. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=289.5s)]
*  Unprecedented political questions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBzwnFSyekg&t=291.38s)]
