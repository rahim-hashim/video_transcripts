# The Senate tries to slam the door on Gaetz: Politico
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw)
*  Do not use the justice system as a weapon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=0.0s)]
*  And the message for Republicans is, don't do it on the other side, either, with this [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=6.38s)]
*  absurd AG pick that you just made. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=10.56s)]
*  Justice is different. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  It is a combination of policy, law, and also morality. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  You do not use our justice system as a political weapon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=19.7s)]
*  Voters rejected it in November, and they're going to reject it if Republicans try to do [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=24.04s)]
*  it also. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=28.44s)]
*  When things rise above the din, the justice system is one of those things. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=29.6s)]
*  That was Fox News host and former Congressman Trey Gowdy yesterday warning against confirming [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=35.0s)]
*  Donald Trump's choice for attorney general Matt Gaetz. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=40.08s)]
*  Joining us now, White House correspondent for Politico and co-author of the playbook, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=43.72s)]
*  Eugene Daniels. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=48.36s)]
*  Eugene, great to see you as always. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=49.36s)]
*  So you've got some new stuff in Playbook that gives insight into the fears Republican Congress [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=50.88s)]
*  have with this particular pick, the Gaetz pick. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=56.68s)]
*  Tell us about it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=59.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=60.64s)]
*  I mean, first of all, what we found was that senators had been talking to Suzy Wiles, who [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=61.64s)]
*  is his incoming chief of staff and de facto chief of staff currently, the president himself, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=67.88s)]
*  and JD Vance, who's kind of been the sherpa over in the Senate for some of these more [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=73.76s)]
*  controversial picks that President Trump has already chosen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=77.32s)]
*  And so the warning and saying, like, hey, this guy isn't conformable, right? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=80.8s)]
*  What they're trying to do is get ahead of it, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=85.56s)]
*  Their hope, it seems, is that they convince President Trump and President-elect Trump [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=87.52s)]
*  to pull this nomination back so that they don't have to take some kind of hard vote, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=92.0s)]
*  especially for those that are up in 2026. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=96.84s)]
*  Their concern is that Gaetz gets actually nominated. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=100.0s)]
*  It comes to them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  They have to they feel like they have to vote against him for more reasons. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  And then they're primaried and they lose their jobs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=109.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=111.76s)]
*  That's really important. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=112.76s)]
*  I also really have a concern about President-elect Trump wasting political capital on Gaetz and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  their estimation that there are so many things that he wants to get done. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  Some of them that are going to take heavier lifts than maybe folks around the president-elect [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  might think, considering that they have, you know, the three branches of the two legislative [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  branches and the executive branch here starting January 20th. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=133.12s)]
*  And so they want him to kind of pull back a little bit, think about the fact that, you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  know, there are other things that you want to do that are controversial. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=142.4s)]
*  And Gaetz may not be the person to kind of blow up all that political capital you just [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=146.16s)]
*  gained in November on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=150.32s)]
*  So Eugene Gaetz is obviously the biggest headline here, but there have been a number of Trump's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  picks that have received a lot of attention for how unqualified. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  OK, but also how controversial they are. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=163.76s)]
*  And it seems like Trump's intent with these agencies is to in some ways perhaps destroy [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  them or at least use them to punish his political foes, that retribution he talks about. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=170.8s)]
*  But I'm curious as to what you think here, what your reporting tells you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=175.2s)]
*  He could have taken, made a less inflammatory pick than Gaetz, and that person would have [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  been confirmed and done what he wants. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=183.04s)]
*  Same perhaps with DOD, where the Pete Hedgeseth pick is in question. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=185.28s)]
*  You know, let's talk Dr. Oz, Linda McMahon. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=189.6s)]
*  These are all people who might have a harder time getting through than a more anonymous [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=191.44s)]
*  official. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=196.16s)]
*  But it occurs to me, isn't that sort of the point? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=197.28s)]
*  Trump wants to drive his message home with these very picks? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=199.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, part of it is one, loyalty, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=203.2s)]
*  Donald Trump is kind of rewarding loyalty for a lot of these folks who've had his back [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=206.72s)]
*  for a very long time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=210.88s)]
*  Matt Gaetz being at the top of that list. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=212.4s)]
*  Two, he really cares about kind of central casting. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=214.4s)]
*  We've been talking about that for a really long time. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=216.88s)]
*  It's been a while since he's been president, so we've kind of forgot about that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=219.12s)]
*  He likes people who look like they should be in that role. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=222.24s)]
*  Three, a lot of these people seem to have a disdain or a contempt for the very departments [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=225.36s)]
*  that they are up for. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=231.12s)]
*  So that's another thing that a lot of these folks have in common. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=232.0s)]
*  But also, more importantly, Donald Trump feels like he has his and it's been proven over [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=235.12s)]
*  and over again, control over the Republican Party. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=241.12s)]
*  So while we might look at the list of names and look at their qualifications compared [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  to other folks who've held those jobs, we might think, well, something's off here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=249.6s)]
*  He doesn't seem to care. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=253.6s)]
*  For him, the Republican Party is going to do kind of what he wants. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=254.96s)]
*  He's a leader of that party, and they've proven time and time again to look past some [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=258.88s)]
*  of the more salacious details of folks around him and his orbit and been on his side. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=263.04s)]
*  And that is his estimation at this point as well. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=268.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=270.88s)]
*  Now, we might have some developments on the Gaetz pick today because the House [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=271.36s)]
*  Office Committee is scheduled to meet and discuss that probe. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=274.0s)]
*  What's the latest you've heard as to whether or not we'll see that report? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=278.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  At this point, the interesting thing about House at this committee is they don't release [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=282.32s)]
*  their agenda. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=285.68s)]
*  So everything is actually very secret, which is really annoying as a reporter. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=286.24s)]
*  But what we do know is they're going to meet behind closed doors. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=290.56s)]
*  It's possible they'll bring up the conversation about whether or not to vote is possible. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=293.92s)]
*  They might just vote whether or not to release it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=297.44s)]
*  They have a 50-50 split, Republicans and Democrats on that committee. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  And so it's possible that the vote goes down on party lines. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=304.16s)]
*  But then there's also the possibility, especially for those of us that have covered Congress, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=308.88s)]
*  that it gets leaked at some point. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=313.36s)]
*  I will caution people who think that that is the one way that this is going to end up. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=316.08s)]
*  The House Ethics Committee is still one of those committees that works kind of with [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=321.2s)]
*  trust and bipartisanship, right? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=324.4s)]
*  They keep losing those committees over the years. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=326.16s)]
*  And that kind of break in trust could ruin the way that they actually operate. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=329.2s)]
*  And that's something that both Democrats and Republicans are very cognizant of as [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=333.36s)]
*  them moving forward on the Gates pick. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=337.04s)]
*  Well, my vote is that report get leaked to you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=338.72s)]
*  Eugene, good to see you as always. Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZL8QnZTvRw&t=342.88s)]
