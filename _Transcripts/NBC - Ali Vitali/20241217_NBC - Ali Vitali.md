# Trump says he's a 'believer' in polio vaccine, but is against school mandates
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8)
*  At Mar-a-Lago news conference yesterday, President-elect Trump downplayed concerns that his administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=0.0s)]
*  could revoke authorization of the polio vaccine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=5.92s)]
*  This comes after reports that a key advisor to Trump's health and human services pick, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=10.08s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was looking to reverse approval of that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=14.88s)]
*  Let's take a look at what the president-elect had to say yesterday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=19.68s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen very quickly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=24.12s)]
*  I think you're going to find that Bobby is much, he's a very rational guy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  I found him to be very rational. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=29.84s)]
*  No, nothing, you're not going to lose the polio vaccine. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=31.36s)]
*  That's not going to happen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=34.92s)]
*  I saw what happened with the polio. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=36.96s)]
*  I have friends that were very much affected by that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=38.6s)]
*  I have friends from many years ago and they have obviously, they're still in not such [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=43.6s)]
*  good shape because of it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=48.36s)]
*  You know, that was, and many people died. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=49.96s)]
*  And the moment they took that vaccine, it ended. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=53.0s)]
*  Dr. Jonas Salk did a great job. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=57.0s)]
*  So I don't anticipate that at all. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=60.0s)]
*  But we're going to look into finding why is the autism rate so much higher than it was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=62.76s)]
*  20, 25, 30 years ago. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=66.8s)]
*  I mean, it's like, it's a hundred times higher. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=68.2s)]
*  There's something wrong and we're going to try finding that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=72.04s)]
*  Joining us now, Chief White House correspondent for the New York Times, Peter Baker. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=76.08s)]
*  Peter, thanks so much for joining us this morning. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=79.88s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=82.72s)]
*  The RFK Jr. pick. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=84.2s)]
*  We know he'll be back on the Hill today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=85.54s)]
*  Trump loves the idea of a Kennedy supporting him being in his potential cabinet vaccines, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=87.86s)]
*  though, it's become a real source of concern for many. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  Where do you assess how Kennedy's chances stand? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=96.34s)]
*  Well, you know, at the moment, a lot of Senate Republicans are making clear that they're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=99.9s)]
*  bending to Donald Trump's will. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=103.62s)]
*  They believe they argue that he has a right to put his people in place and absent some, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=105.9s)]
*  you know, extraordinary circumstance. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=112.34s)]
*  To the contrary, they're willing to go along with that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=113.86s)]
*  So far, the only red line they have drawn was on Matt Gaetz. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=115.82s)]
*  Pete Hegseth obviously faces trouble. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=119.86s)]
*  It's not a given that he's going to get in. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=121.96s)]
*  But for the moment, Senate Republicans are seemingly staying behind him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=123.32s)]
*  And yeah, RFK Jr. I think is sort of slid in behind Hegseth without as much controversy [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=126.66s)]
*  as you might have expected for somebody with his out of the mainstream views. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=132.34s)]
*  So, Peter, we're so grateful that you're here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=136.22s)]
*  You've been a chronicler of the presidency for so long. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=138.06s)]
*  Give us your thoughts here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  January 20th now, just a little over a month away, Trump back in power, emboldened after [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  all that he's been through in the criminal trials and a reelection bid has, as you say, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=149.7s)]
*  Republicans bending to his will. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=154.61999999999998s)]
*  What are you expecting once he sits in the Oval Office yet again? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think the idea that he the changed person is is an interesting one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=160.66s)]
*  You hear that from some people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  My colleague, Maggie Haven wrote this morning that what's really changed is Washington and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=167.7s)]
*  how they're responding to him. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=170.78s)]
*  Trump himself observed this yesterday at his news conference. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=173.06s)]
*  He says, you know, last time everybody was fighting me, this time everybody seems to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  like me. Well, I don't think like him, but they're certainly deferring to him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  And you've seen the parade of, you know, billionaires and tech CEOs streaming to Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  to, you know, to kiss the ring. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=188.9s)]
*  And you've seen these Republicans basically going along. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=190.94s)]
*  And it's true. Last time around and eight years ago, we took office. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=194.34s)]
*  There was resistance among a lot of Republicans. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  Since then, he has come to dominate the party in a way that very few people have ever [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=199.29999999999998s)]
*  dominated a political party, if ever in this country. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  And it's he that the apogee in some ways of his influence and power, despite all of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  the things we've seen over the last few years, but despite trying to overturn an election, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=212.54s)]
*  despite being convicted on 34 felony counts, despite it all, he seemed to be stronger [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=215.94s)]
*  than ever. But that doesn't necessarily last. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=221.42s)]
*  We'll see what happens. There are still laws of political gravity in Washington. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  And if he comes in as he did last time and instigates a lot of controversial policies [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=227.46s)]
*  and chaos, then, you know, these these things tend to have a shelf life of their own. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And we should certainly know the past often prologue. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=241.3s)]
*  Every time he's been given the choice between unity and division, he's chosen division [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  and controversy. So, Peter, let's talk about what those first 100 days might look like. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  We should expect a flurry of executive orders movement on things like mass deportations, perhaps. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=253.78s)]
*  He wants to work on the tax cut. What else? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=259.46000000000004s)]
*  How do you think Trump approaches his first 100 days in office? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=262.1s)]
*  Well, he clearly is moving at a faster pace this time than last time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=266.42s)]
*  He understands how things work a lot better than he did eight years ago. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=270.38s)]
*  Right. You see this in the rollout of nominations or choices for nominations, you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=273.42s)]
*  day after day, night after night. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=278.14s)]
*  He's moved to the point we're already now to the ambassador of Luxembourg and down to that level. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, I think on January 20, 21st, in those first few days, you're going to see him roll out a whole lot of things, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=284.54s)]
*  some of them quite controversial, some of them will hit courts right away. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=291.5s)]
*  Things like trying to reverse birthright citizenship, which has been a policy in this country under the Constitution now for more than a century. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=294.78000000000003s)]
*  Things like, you know, pardons for January 6th attackers, the people who attacked the Capitol [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  four years ago, things along the lines of retribution against his foes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=308.78000000000003s)]
*  He seemed to relish yesterday the idea of his own personal lawsuits against the media. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=313.66s)]
*  And by the end of the day, had sued a pollster in Iowa because he didn't like his the pre-election poll that went against him and was actually wrong. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=318.70000000000005s)]
*  But hardly seems to be a crime. But we'll see where things go. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=326.38000000000005s)]
*  I think he is planning to to hit a lot of directions all at once. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=330.22s)]
*  It's like the movie, everything everywhere all at once. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=333.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, well said. And he does so with Republican majorities, though slim in both House and Senate and a Democratic party that's still sorting out how to respond and embolden Donald Trump back in power soon. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=336.3s)]
*  Chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, Peter Baker. Peter, thank you as always. We appreciate you joining us this morning. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzTX2wx_Eo8&t=348.62s)]
