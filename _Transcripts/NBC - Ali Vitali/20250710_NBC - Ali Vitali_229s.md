# Questions surround pause of weapons shipment to Ukraine
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4)
*  Sir, yesterday you said that you were not sure who ordered the munitions halted to Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=0.0s)]
*  Have you since been able to figure that out? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=9.24s)]
*  Well, I haven't thought about it because we're looking at Ukraine right now and munitions, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=10.68s)]
*  but I have no, I have not gone into it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=15.16s)]
*  What does it say that such a big decision could be made inside your government? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=18.12s)]
*  I would know. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=22.92s)]
*  If a decision was made, I will know. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=23.92s)]
*  I'll be the first to know. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=26.56s)]
*  In fact, most likely I'd give the order, but I haven't done that yet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  That was President Trump yesterday when pressed about the pause of a recent U.S. weapons shipment [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=37.12s)]
*  Joining us now, Pentagon reporter for Politico Paul McCleary. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=38.12s)]
*  Paul, you've been reporting on this extensively. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=40.72s)]
*  What's your understanding of what happened here? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Because as much as the president is saying, I would have given the order, I would have [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=45.56s)]
*  been the first to know, it kind of sounds like he wasn't. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's not clear. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=50.04s)]
*  I mean, it seems what happens is he ordered a review of the Pentagon's munitions stockpiles. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=51.04s)]
*  After the NATO summit late last month. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=56.52s)]
*  And what seems to have happened is the Pentagon really took that and ran with it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  It kind of forged its own policy here as far as cutting off lethal aid for Ukraine and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=62.24s)]
*  air defenses. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=69.16s)]
*  This is the third time that Pete Hegseth and Bridge Colby, the Pentagon policy chief, have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=70.16s)]
*  done this in the Trump administration, cut off aid for Ukraine. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=74.68s)]
*  And each time the White House has had to turn that aid back on, as we just saw this week, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  decisions made to stop it last week took everyone by surprise. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=82.84s)]
*  The Hill wasn't informed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=86.0s)]
*  The State Department wasn't informed. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=87.0s)]
*  The White House. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  It didn't seem to reach the level of the president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  And then the president just on live on television this week decided to turn that spigot back [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=91.96s)]
*  on of the weapons. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  You said two names at the Pentagon, one of which our audience has heard a lot, Pete Hegseth, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=97.08s)]
*  the other Bridge Colby that maybe many of them haven't heard from before. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=100.83999999999999s)]
*  Why is he important? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=104.44s)]
*  He's the head of policy at the Pentagon, and he has had much more experience at the Pentagon [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=105.96s)]
*  and government and in Washington than Pete Hegseth or anyone on his staff. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=112.04s)]
*  They're all pretty new to Washington and the Pentagon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  They've never run an organization like this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=120.2s)]
*  Colby's been around. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=122.28s)]
*  He's done this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=123.28s)]
*  He knows how the building works. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=124.28s)]
*  He knows how the town works. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=125.28s)]
*  So he, as someone said to me, he knows how to push paper. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=126.28s)]
*  He can do things. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=128.76s)]
*  He can get things done because he understands the system in a way that Hegseth and people, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=129.76s)]
*  his top advisors, really don't. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=133.8s)]
*  And I think it comes, interestingly, against the backdrop of Senator Tom Tillis, newly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=135.52s)]
*  unshackled from future re-elections because he said he's not running again, saying on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=139.4s)]
*  another network that Hegseth is, in Tillis' words, out of his depth running an organization [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=143.36s)]
*  of this size, which was the very concern that senators had when they didn't vote to confirm [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=149.68s)]
*  him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Tillis, of course, came around ultimately. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  But is that the kind of buyer's remorse that you're hearing from Republicans? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=157.08s)]
*  There's a lot of frustration on Capitol Hill, right, among Democrats for sure and increasingly [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=160.4s)]
*  among Republicans who are not getting briefed by the Pentagon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=164.76s)]
*  And normally there's a pretty steady drumbeat of Pentagon officials uniformed in civilians [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=168.08s)]
*  going up to Capitol Hill briefing senators. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=172.08s)]
*  That's not really happening under this administration. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=174.4s)]
*  So they bill themselves as the most transparent Pentagon in history. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=176.12s)]
*  But I mean, one, they're not talking to the press and they're also not briefing the Hill. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's been, we're six months in, and that's really having an effect. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=183.72000000000003s)]
*  And senators are really starting to push back against that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=186.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  And we know that Bridge Colby, for example, is the person that our guest yesterday, Congressman [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  Eugene Vindman, has been asking for a classified briefing about this weapons pause. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=193.0s)]
*  Today was the deadline. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=197.8s)]
*  We'll see if they actually respond and if lawmakers get that briefing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=198.8s)]
*  But Paul McCleary, we thank you for coming on explaining it to us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=201.6s)]
*  We'll, of course, be reading your latest piece, which is available online now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=204.4s)]
*  It's great reporting. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=014gZrPySR4&t=207.72s)]
