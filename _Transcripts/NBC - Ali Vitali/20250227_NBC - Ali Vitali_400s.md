Hillary Scholten, a Democrat representing a Michigan district Trump won by 18 points, tells 'Way Too Early' that voters in deep-red areas are “terrified” by the “rampant cuts” and “horrified” by Musk’s influence in government.

# 'Rampant cuts' are alarming voters in even the reddest districts, says Congresswoman
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0)
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson yesterday claimed without any evidence that angry constituents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=0.0s)]
*  at town halls nationwide are actually paid Democratic protesters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Over the past week, there's been a wave of Republican lawmakers returning to their states [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=9.26s)]
*  and districts and facing citizens who are upset over the recent flurry of cuts in federal [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=12.92s)]
*  funding and mass layoffs or even just outright confused about what's going on from Washington. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=17.3s)]
*  The speaker brushed off concerns that those incidents could affect Republicans in the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=22.46s)]
*  midterms. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=26.26s)]
*  We've seen the blowback that some Republicans in your caucus are getting when they go back [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=28.26s)]
*  home to their districts, worried about these cuts or worried about what Doge is doing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=33.1s)]
*  Do you have concerns that that's anything that Democrats will be able to use to run [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=37.82s)]
*  against those Republicans? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=42.22s)]
*  No, because the vid, no I don't, because the videos you saw of the town halls were for [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=43.7s)]
*  paid protesters in many of those places. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=48.1s)]
*  These are Democrats who went to the events early and filled up the seats. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=50.3s)]
*  If you had, if the videos had panned outside the buildings. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=53.660000000000004s)]
*  They were all paid protesters though, Mr. Speaker. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=55.66s)]
*  Many of them were. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  A Republican acknowledged they were his constituents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  One Republican acknowledged they were his constituents. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=66.22s)]
*  Okay, but they had Democrats come and fill the seats early. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=67.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=70.06s)]
*  This is an old playbook that they pulled out and ran and it made it look like that what [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=71.06s)]
*  is happening in Washington is unpopular. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=75.42s)]
*  First of all, yes to what Caitlin said, that these are constituents, but also just because [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=79.3s)]
*  you're a Republican member of a district doesn't mean that you don't have Democratic [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=83.18s)]
*  constituents and they can, just like their Republican counterparts, go and voice their [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=86.22000000000001s)]
*  concerns at town halls. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=90.5s)]
*  But what Speaker Johnson said there about polling, he appears to be citing a recent [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=92.34s)]
*  Harvard Caps Harris poll that found 77% say a full examination of all government expenditures [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=95.62s)]
*  is necessary. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=101.72s)]
*  However, a recent Washington Post Ipsos poll found that just 34% approve of the job Elon [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=102.72s)]
*  Musk is doing within the federal government. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now, Democratic Congresswoman Hillary Schultz of Michigan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=111.7s)]
*  Thanks for joining us here on set. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  So you see the speaker there saying that it's Democratic protesters. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=116.86s)]
*  We don't have any indication of that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  And Republican lawmakers even said, yeah, these are my constituents, even if they're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=123.4s)]
*  wary of the fact that they have to go to these town halls. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=127.14s)]
*  But what's your reaction when you hear them saying that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, it sounds so dismissive to these constituents who have taken their time to come out and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=131.38s)]
*  voice their concerns. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  And again, you know, just as as though they're claiming there is all this rampant fraud [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=139.06s)]
*  and abuse without any evidence, they're making these unfounded claims and disastrously telling [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=144.18s)]
*  the members of their body not to hold town halls. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=151.14000000000001s)]
*  It is so critically important that we are showing up and listening to our constituents [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=155.44s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=159.62s)]
*  And I can tell you, I've had the exact opposite experience. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=160.62s)]
*  You're not in a deep blue area. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=164.18s)]
*  I am the first Democrat in a century to hold the seat that I am sitting in right now. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=166.26s)]
*  Last week when I was home, we went to have a meeting in a township in my district that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=172.4s)]
*  is deep, deep red. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=177.7s)]
*  Trump won the township by close to 18 points. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=179.98s)]
*  And the meeting was actually supposed to just be with the township leadership about some [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=183.14s)]
*  municipal issues. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=187.94s)]
*  But as with all public meetings, they they noticed it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=189.82s)]
*  And 50 people showed up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=193.44s)]
*  We thought we were going to hear all kinds of pushback against me, you know, trying to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=195.86s)]
*  hold Trump and Musk accountable. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  But what we heard was story after story from people who were terrified about the rampant [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=202.12s)]
*  cuts, who were horrified that an unelected billionaire, Trump's top campaign donor, has [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=207.24s)]
*  potentially access to their taxpayer data. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=214.44000000000003s)]
*  When I told them about my bill, the CLEAR Act and the Taxpayer Data Protection Act, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  they stood up and cheered because they were so grateful to see someone pushing back against [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=222.4s)]
*  this agenda, against something that completely cuts them out of this process. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=229.96s)]
*  You know, Ali, you're exactly right mentioning this this polling about people who are OK [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=235.12s)]
*  with an overview of the spending. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=241.56s)]
*  I have repeatedly said we should be having a major audit right now of where our spending [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  is. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=251.0s)]
*  Let's find it. Let's see the proof. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=252.62s)]
*  Let's root it out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=254.42s)]
*  But then decisions about how to make those cuts need to come through Congress. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=255.98s)]
*  Right. It is constitutionally defined because that's how the people get to say. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=260.78s)]
*  And that's one of the things that actually means it's actually one of the ways that Musk [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=265.3s)]
*  is impacting now these conversations about keeping the government open. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=269.58s)]
*  And when you talk to your Democratic colleagues, I had one of your colleagues say to me the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=273.34s)]
*  other day, there's a mandate now for the government to shut down because of what Musk is [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=276.1s)]
*  doing. You see it that way. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=279.66s)]
*  Would you shut the government? Would you allow that to happen? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=281.08s)]
*  I am going to do everything in my power to continue to work to keep the government [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  open. But we're going to do it in a fiscally responsible way. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  And if they're telling us there's all this this fraud and yet they want to raise the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  debt ceiling. You know, now they're talking about a continuing resolution. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=298.68s)]
*  Why are we going to continue doing it in this way if they apparently have evidence of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  fraud and abuse? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=306.76s)]
*  But I know the impact that a government shutdown will have. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=308.26s)]
*  And I am one of the most bipartisan members of Congress. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=312.02s)]
*  I still stand here today saying we're going to work with you to try to keep the government [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=314.98s)]
*  open. But we've got to get down to business here and start getting a budget that we can [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  pass by March 14th. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=325.46s)]
*  That is right around the corner. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  You also are from a state that has a ton of attention on it, both because it's a swing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=328.58s)]
*  state, Michigan, of course, but then also because there's a bunch of higher office [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=332.96s)]
*  positions that are currently open, including a Senate seat vacated by Gary Peters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=336.52s)]
*  You know, I have to ask you, are you thinking about that seat? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=340.32s)]
*  You know, I am I am laser focused on West Michigan and serving my constituents right [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=343.2s)]
*  now. You know, we are we are listening to the deep concerns in the district and especially [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=347.8s)]
*  after being home last week and hearing, you know, about how terrified people are. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=355.36s)]
*  I know that right now my main focus is on serving them, making sure that we can push [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=360.18s)]
*  back against some of these unconstitutional overreaches that we are seeing from the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=365.1s)]
*  executive branch. Thank you so much for bringing us the experience on the ground and then [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=369.5s)]
*  also how it's translating back in the halls of Congress. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Hillary Scolton of Michigan, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=376.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBDD4F9_ps0&t=390.16s)]
