# Sen. Graham blames 'culture' at Mar-a-Lago for Trump's 2020 election denialism
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124)
*  At one point in his new book, Bob Woodward details how Republican Senator Lindsey Graham [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=0.0s)]
*  blamed the culture at Mar-a-Lago for Donald Trump's inability to put the 2020 election [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=5.48s)]
*  behind him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=10.64s)]
*  So, in a conversation with colleagues, Graham reportedly said, quote, it's the attitude [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=11.64s)]
*  down at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=16.44s)]
*  You know, all the people he hangs around with down there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=17.44s)]
*  They constantly feed this narrative. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=20.8s)]
*  He thinks he lost because of all these bizarre conspiracies. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  He didn't. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=27.32s)]
*  Biden won fair and square, Graham added. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=28.56s)]
*  Trump doesn't like to hear that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=31.24s)]
*  I imagine he won't like hearing that quote either. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=32.72s)]
*  Joining us now, Congressional Investigations reporter for The Washington Post, Jackie Alamini. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=35.12s)]
*  Jackie, good to see you this morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=40.16s)]
*  So let's dig in a little bit here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=41.76s)]
*  Certainly when Donald Trump was in office, his aides would always get nervous when he'd [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=44.84s)]
*  go to Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster because they weren't sure what his friends, often his rich [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=48.64s)]
*  friends would say to him. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=52.2s)]
*  He'd come back with some crazy idea. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=53.32s)]
*  Senator Graham is suggesting that that environment at Mar-a-Lago help perpetuate the big lie. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=55.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=61.0s)]
*  I mean, there are no holds barred at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=62.0s)]
*  This was the big concern over four years and really over the past four years, too, especially [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=64.48s)]
*  as the president, former president, built this cocoon around him and filled his club [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=69.2s)]
*  with all of these people who told him exactly what he wanted to be hearing, especially in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=75.12s)]
*  the wake of January 6th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=81.64s)]
*  But in typical Trumpian fashion, there's really been little that they can do about that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=84.72s)]
*  There are people like Nick Fuentes, Laura Loomer, all of these hangar honors who now [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=91.52s)]
*  have made their way really into the campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=96.24s)]
*  But Lindsey Graham's very candid on the record account of the environment that Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=100.48s)]
*  is in that is akin to a place like North Korea with the praise that's lavish on Trump at [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=107.72s)]
*  times is a rare on the record account. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=112.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  It's another moment, though, also where we have a Republican lawmaker, a prominent Republican [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  lawmaker say one thing behind the scenes about Trump that he never would say in a public [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=121.52s)]
*  setting in front of the media, let's say. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=126.72s)]
*  And like that, to your point, is continuing even now at a very dangerous moment for our [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=128.68s)]
*  country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=133.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is the leading spreader of disinformation and misinformation about the response to Hurricane [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=134.64s)]
*  Helene. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=139.56s)]
*  And now we have another even bigger storm barreling down on the Florida coast. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=140.56s)]
*  Just talk to us about that dynamic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=145.16s)]
*  I mean, Annapolina Luna, she represents St. Petersburg, that district that is about to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=147.2s)]
*  get crushed where the mayor came out on TV and said, if you do not evacuate, you are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=152.48s)]
*  going to get killed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=157.32s)]
*  And she is one of the lead propagators of this disinformation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=158.64s)]
*  She appeared on stage with Donald Trump last week. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=162.12s)]
*  These are lawmakers who are directly emboldened by Trump and who are rewarded for propagating [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  this propaganda, really, and disinformation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=169.52s)]
*  She was even corrected on Twitter for demanding that FEMA provide funding for hurricane relief, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=173.2s)]
*  even though she just two weeks ago voted against it in Congress against a bill that would have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=180.2s)]
*  authorized more relief fund from FEMA. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=184.88s)]
*  She's also one of the lead spreaders of disinformation that FEMA has instead directed funds to helping [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=187.68s)]
*  illegal immigrants rather than hurricane relief. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=194.56s)]
*  That again is false. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=196.92s)]
*  Of course, there are real issues to take up with FEMA, every single hurricane that we've had. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  There, you know, these are really challenging situations with hard to reach communities, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=203.94s)]
*  especially in places like rural North Carolina. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  There are real issues that, you know, constituents and lawmakers can take up with FEMA, but it's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=213.54s)]
*  certainly not the issues that we're seeing Republicans rally around right now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=220.85999999999999s)]
*  Talk to us a little bit more about how these storms become politicized, when of course [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  there are a moment when politics should be set aside instead of the exact opposite happens. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=230.7s)]
*  It seemed like President Biden tried to defuse a little bit yesterday. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=234.78s)]
*  He went out of his way to say he's spoken to Governor Sanders of Florida. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=236.98s)]
*  They had a good conversation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=239.34s)]
*  But from the GOP side, it's often the opposite, including DeSantis saying, his team heard [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=241.66s)]
*  his team saying they wouldn't even take a call from Vice President Harris. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=246.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the timing of it just lends itself to pure politicization. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=249.9s)]
*  We're a month out from the election and Republican lawmakers, especially in these vulnerable [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=254.94s)]
*  districts, again, this Annapolina Luna, she's running against a woman named Whitney Fox. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=259.14s)]
*  This is a district that should have been winnable, except that Annapolina Luna is extremely MAGA [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=263.82s)]
*  and her district is a little bit more purple and St. Petersburg is actually a little bit [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=269.26s)]
*  more of a blue city. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=273.74s)]
*  And this is something that is catching up to her. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=275.74s)]
*  She's having to explain for why she voted against this hurricane relief funds right [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=279.24s)]
*  in the midst of hurricane season. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=282.5s)]
*  So naturally, you're going to see Republican lawmakers on their heels trying to explain [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=284.58s)]
*  why they didn't support additional funding. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=288.3s)]
*  And lastly, just give us a very quick sense of the state of the race for the Senate right [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=290.74s)]
*  now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=294.14s)]
*  I know Wisconsin Senator, Senator Baldwin got some polling. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=295.14s)]
*  The race shows a tightening race. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=298.06s)]
*  I mean, Democratic lawmakers across the board, especially Wisconsin, Montana, they're in [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=300.22s)]
*  really tight races. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=306.2s)]
*  Texas as well. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=307.2s)]
*  Texas was always going to be a long shot, but Wisconsin and Montana are those two hotspots [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=309.2s)]
*  that we're especially looking at. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=313.96s)]
*  Tammy Baldwin, again, I think it was turned to a toss up now in a place where she normally [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  previously would have been a bit of a shoe in. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=324.12s)]
*  John Tester as well, someone who has defied political gravity for really the entirety [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=327.88s)]
*  now seems to be behind a fairly vulnerable and weak Republican candidate. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=333.44000000000005s)]
*  It's unclear if this is purely a Kamala Harris effect or what, but the Senate Democratic [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=340.44000000000005s)]
*  forecast is not great. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=348.70000000000005s)]
*  Growing pessimistic for sure. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=350.68s)]
*  And the signs there about Wisconsin, does that also, what does that mean for the presidential [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  race? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=355.44000000000005s)]
*  It's such a key battleground. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=356.44000000000005s)]
*  Congressional Investigations reporter for the Washington Post, Jackie Alamane. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=357.44000000000005s)]
*  Janky, thank you so much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=359.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JooyiOno124&t=362.72s)]
