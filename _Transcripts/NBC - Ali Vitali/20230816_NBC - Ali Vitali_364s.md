# Prominent Republicans slam Trump election fraud claims
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [August 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo)
*  Welcome back. Several prominent Republicans in Georgia are railing against Donald Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=0.0s)]
*  continued promises to reveal information detailing election fraud. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=5.84s)]
*  replied to a Trump social media post yesterday, writing in part this, for nearly three years [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=13.16s)]
*  now, anyone with evidence of fraud has failed to come forward under oath and prove anything [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=19.28s)]
*  in a court of law. Our elections in Georgia are secure, accessible, and fair, and will [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=24.68s)]
*  continue to be as long as I am governor. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=30.04s)]
*  put out a statement, writing this, the most basic principles of a strong democracy and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=36.16s)]
*  accountability are respect for the Constitution and the rule of law. You either have it or [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=41.0s)]
*  you don't. Really strong statements from both these officials, more even than they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=46.92s)]
*  they wanted to prove that point. Joining us now, Professor at Princeton University, our [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=51.98s)]
*  friend Eddie Glaude Jr. Eddie, great to see you. You have said to me a number of times [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=57.22s)]
*  over the years, I think with accelerated frequency, whether on air or privately, that you worry [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=63.62s)]
*  right now that the nation is being tested, that we're experiencing a series of crises, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=69.14s)]
*  and there's an open question as to whether or not the country can rise to meet this moment. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=73.62s)]
*  What do you think right now? Do you have faith in the American public, our public officials [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=79.7s)]
*  and voters alike, that they can? Well, I have to have faith, John, and first of all, it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=83.86s)]
*  great to see you, and that was a really horrible strike zone. I have to have faith. I have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  to have faith in the American people that each generation in some ways, we're tasked [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=94.34s)]
*  to in some ways secure democracy. It's a difficult moment. We have to ask ourselves, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=99.78s)]
*  will we rise to the challenge? And I think in asking the question itself, we're priming [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  ourselves to take on the responsibility that is before us. But we will see. We will see. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=109.08s)]
*  It's a difficult time. So Eddie, are you heartened at all by these Republicans like Kemp and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=113.84s)]
*  Raffensperger, sort of going above and beyond to push back against Trump's false claims? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=118.8s)]
*  I mean, he's of course provided no evidence of this voter fraud. What is your read on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=124.64s)]
*  there? Because it does seem to me though, they're pretty lonely voices out there among [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=131.16s)]
*  Yeah, they are. But I think Raffensperger's point, either you believe in the rule of law [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=135.84s)]
*  in the Constitution or you don't, is precisely where we are. Hopefully more Republicans will [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=140.12s)]
*  join them, but I'm not really, how shall I put this, John, I don't really have a lot [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=145.08s)]
*  of faith that the fever dream will break. It's in some ways we have to stop coddling [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=149.32s)]
*  these folks and just simply say either you're on the side of the Constitutional rule of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=153.58s)]
*  law or you're not, just to echo Raffensperger. I can't believe I'm echoing the former secretary [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  of state of Georgia at this moment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=160.62s)]
*  Well, that's where we are right now. So this also, we shouldn't lose sight of the idea [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  of some of the regular people who've also been impacted by this, right? We've been chronicling [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=166.84s)]
*  those poll workers in Georgia who received, who were targets of such hate and terrible [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=171.8s)]
*  racism and threats of violence because they were unfairly maligned by Trump, Giuliani [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  and others. And there's real concerns about elections this time around, that the state [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=183.96s)]
*  and local officials are going to have a hard time getting workers, getting volunteers [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=189.36s)]
*  to do these jobs, important, vital jobs so central to our democracy because of further [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=193.4s)]
*  threats of violence, violence that frankly is seemingly becoming more central to our [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  political narrative. What do you think about when you consider all this? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, part of the exhaustion, right, has everything to do with is it worth risking [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  myself, risking my family to engage in the arduous work that democracy requires of us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=215.32s)]
*  And of course, part of the terror of the moment is to get everyday ordinary people to kind [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=222.84s)]
*  of make the decision not to engage, to get folk to kind of abscond their responsibility [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=227.84s)]
*  for democracy itself. We saw this happening in the 1870s and in the 1880s, Jonathan. There [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=232.4s)]
*  is historical precedent for this. But in each instance, we've bounced back. And so as people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=238.12s)]
*  kind of weigh the cost, we have to understand that democracy hangs in the balance and it's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=243.12s)]
*  in our hands. Whether we are afraid or not, we're going to have to step up. And I think [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=247.88s)]
*  we have to be honest with ourselves, Jonathan. Violence is always looming on the horizon, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=253.24s)]
*  especially in this moment. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=258.16s)]
*  And lastly, Eddie, it's a connected thought. There's been much said about how Donald Trump [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=260.68s)]
*  has really eroded Americans' faith in their institutions. Now, some of that started before [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=265.36s)]
*  Trump, but he has absolutely accelerated it. And it's across the spectrum, whether [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=269.96s)]
*  it's government or media or basic pieces of our society. And it feels to me that that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=273.64s)]
*  erosion, that's going to be hard to regain that trust, even when Donald Trump is off [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=282.64s)]
*  the stage, whenever that might be. Do you feel like those are things that can be repaired? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=286.0s)]
*  Some days I do, some days I don't. It all depends on how honest we are with ourselves. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=292.2s)]
*  We have to start telling ourselves the truth. Have I said to you over and over again, you've [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=296.88s)]
*  written a book about the big lie. Well, we've told ourselves a lot of little lies that kind [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=300.64s)]
*  of make up the backdrop of that big lie. We're going to have to grow up. We're going to have [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=304.4s)]
*  to grow up and take responsibility for imagining our democracy anew. And that means we can't [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  look at this moment, Jonathan, really quickly as just simply entertainment. We can't look [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=314.88s)]
*  at it as just simply a partisan race. We have to understand that the very foundations of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=318.56s)]
*  the polity are at stake. Will we take the responsibility requisite for our moment? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=324.76s)]
*  That's the question. And in order to do that, we have to be honest with ourselves, it seems [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=329.76s)]
*  to me. A true highlight for me is any time we get to speak to Professor of Princeton [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=332.84s)]
*  University, Eddie Glogg Jr., and thankfully we will again on Morning Joe in a little bit. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=338.2s)]
*  Thank you, my friend. We'll talk to you again in a few minutes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orYQKC-riFo&t=342.2s)]
