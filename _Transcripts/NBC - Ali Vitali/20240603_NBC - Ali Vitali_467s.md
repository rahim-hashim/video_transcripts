# U.S. urges Israel and Hamas to accept ceasefire proposal
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I)
*  Back as we turn to some significant news out of the Middle East, a senior Israeli official tells NBC News that President Biden's description of the latest ceasefire proposal is quote, not accurate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=0.0s)]
*  The official specifically disputed that Israel has agreed to fully withdraw its troops from Gaza Gaza, a clause that second phase of the proposal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=13.0s)]
*  The comment comes as far right members of the Israeli government have voiced their opposition to the deal. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=22.0s)]
*  President Biden announced the framework on Friday, describing it as a durable end to the conflict. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=28.0s)]
*  The three phase plan begins with a six week truce and the return of women, children and other vulnerable hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=34.0s)]
*  Israeli troops would also withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=46.0s)]
*  The second phase would see a permanent end to the war as well as the release of the remaining hostages. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=51.0s)]
*  The third phase outlines a three to five year period of reconstructing Gaza and the establishment of a non Hamas Palestinian government. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=58.0s)]
*  Hamas to this point has responded positively to the proposal, though not officially accepting it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=67.0s)]
*  Now the US is urging both sides to indeed accept the terms while cautioning that more negotiations will need to take place, especially when it comes to moving to phase two, the permanent ceasefire. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=72.0s)]
*  All this progress would make Israel more secure with Israeli families no longer living in the shadow of a terrorist attack. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=84.0s)]
*  All this would create the conditions for a different future, a better future for the Palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security and freedom. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=95.0s)]
*  This path is available once the deal is struck for months. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=109.0s)]
*  People all over the world have called for ceasefire. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=114.0s)]
*  Now it's time to raise your voices in demand that Hamas come to the table, agrees to this deal and end this war that they began. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=117.0s)]
*  Of course, there'll be differences on the specific details that need to be worked out. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=129.0s)]
*  That's natural. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=134.0s)]
*  Hamas come to negotiate ready to deal. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=135.0s)]
*  Then is a negotiation must be given a mandate. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=139.0s)]
*  The necessary flexibility to close that deal. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=143.0s)]
*  Joining us now retired CIA officer Mark Palmaropoulos. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=147.0s)]
*  He's NBC News security and intelligence analyst Mark. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=151.0s)]
*  Good morning. Thanks for joining us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=155.0s)]
*  Let's get your reaction to this breaking news from a senior Israeli official who says the president does not quite have the details correct of this proposal, particularly on the idea of moving troops out of Gaza. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=157.0s)]
*  Do you think from what we know of this deal, do we think that both sides will eventually take it? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=169.0s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, good morning. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=175.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, President Biden, that was a masterful play on a Friday night speech, particularly this is the Sabbath in Israel when some of the more hardline members of the coalition do not have access to meet the deal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=177.0s)]
*  Do not have access to media. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=186.0s)]
*  And he put forth a plan, which in essence was the Israeli plan. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=187.0s)]
*  Now, there's going to be some back and forth on this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=191.0s)]
*  And, you know, you got to remember, Henry Kissinger once said Israel has no foreign policy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=193.0s)]
*  They only have domestic politics. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=197.0s)]
*  And in some sense, Biden's move was a reflection of that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=199.0s)]
*  But at the end, you know, there might be some back and forth. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=202.0s)]
*  You also have some Israeli officials over the last several days saying, no, actually, this was what the Israeli negotiating team did port for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=205.0s)]
*  Don't forget that the Israeli negotiating team, along with the War Cabinet, was aware of this proposal, but the entire cabinet and Israeli population were not. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=212.0s)]
*  So lots of moving parts. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=220.0s)]
*  I think that ultimately the two sides could get together. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=221.0s)]
*  We've been optimistic before the last piece on this, and I'll throw this out there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=225.0s)]
*  It's you know, it doesn't. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=229.0s)]
*  I'm not I'm not entirely sure that Bibi Netanyahu has what it takes to do this, but he has a visit to Washington in within eight weeks. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=230.0s)]
*  There's, you know, arrest warrants out for him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=239.0s)]
*  But there's a chance for him to kind of reshape his legacy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=242.0s)]
*  Will he take this? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=245.0s)]
*  It really remains to be seen. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=246.0s)]
*  One tries to be optimistic. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=247.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, there's really there's no other plan B. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=249.0s)]
*  So, again, a masterful move by the Biden administration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=252.0s)]
*  Let's see what happens next. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=254.0s)]
*  Let's see, actually, if Hamas can accept this as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=256.0s)]
*  Yeah, we'll come back to Hamas in a moment. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=258.0s)]
*  But staying with President Biden and Netanyahu, it did seem like the president was trying to box in the prime minister here a little bit. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=260.0s)]
*  We know Netanyahu is taking a lot of pressure from the far right part of his coalition to not take this deal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=266.0s)]
*  And he's certainly got one eye at all times fixed on his own political future. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=272.0s)]
*  So tell us a little bit more here about the dilemma that Netanyahu faces. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=277.0s)]
*  So he has the more extreme members of his of his coalition who are now threatening to withdraw from the government. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=282.0s)]
*  If the deal collapses, that's Smotrich and Ben-Gabir. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=289.0s)]
*  One of the interesting things will be, does the Israeli opposition actually come to the rescue of Netanyahu? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=293.0s)]
*  Says if he does take this deal, they'll keep the government afloat only for a short period of time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=298.0s)]
*  Kind of lots of moving parts here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=302.0s)]
*  But again, there's a fundamental disconnect between some of Netanyahu's numerous statements about finishing Hamas off entirely versus what his negotiating team put forward. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=304.0s)]
*  Does he do something that is historic but risk his own political survival? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=315.0s)]
*  And I think these are his calculations. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=320.0s)]
*  Never underestimate him. A lot of us can criticize Netanyahu for good reason, but he is frankly a survivor. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=322.0s)]
*  And so in the next several days, we'll kind of go forward. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=328.0s)]
*  One idea, of course, is that he actually okayed this proposal knowing that Hamas or expecting that Hamas would reject it as well. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=331.0s)]
*  So lots of moving parts. Netanyahu's legacy is on the line. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=337.0s)]
*  And again, don't forget this is in the backdrop of a visit to the United States and address of Congress in the next eight weeks, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=342.0s)]
*  which will have really profound effects both here in the United States and abroad as well. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=348.0s)]
*  Unclear. Netanyahu will also get a White House invite when he is in Washington later this summer. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=353.0s)]
*  So, Mark, tell us about is there a sense that Hamas will indeed reject this? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=358.0s)]
*  Address that and then also just give us the latest as to what Israelis' moves in Ra'afe might be. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=363.0s)]
*  Tanks spotted in the center of town. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=368.0s)]
*  Right. So, you know, I think a lot of this when we discuss this proposal kind of fails to address the notion of would Hamas accept this deal as well? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=371.0s)]
*  Because there's parts of this where it's unclear if this would be an actual full cessation of hostilities. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=378.0s)]
*  And don't forget that the Biden administration is also, in essence, given a green light for Israel to go forward with the elimination of Hamas senior leaders. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=384.0s)]
*  That's a whole separate kind of intelligence, you know, kinetic campaign. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=392.0s)]
*  You know, Hamas is going to be under incredible pressure from the Qataris. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=396.0s)]
*  I think what the U.S. is really counting on is for both Qatar and Egypt to bring Hamas to the table on this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=400.0s)]
*  But again, Gaius Sinwar, who in essence is calling the shots, you know, he's deep underground somewhere in a tunnel in Gaza. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=405.0s)]
*  What does his legacy want to be? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=412.0s)]
*  You know, is he willing to actually call and enter the war as well? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=415.0s)]
*  So, you know, we shall see. Finally, on Ra'afe, you have the Israelis, the Americans and the Egyptians, the Qataris as well meeting on this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=420.0s)]
*  One of the things that we, you know, certainly the Egyptians want to see is for Ra'afe to reopen. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=428.0s)]
*  But I think a lot of this has to do if Israel and Hamas can come to a deal. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=432.0s)]
*  Yeah, a very delicate moment in this conflict. We, of course, will stay on every single detail. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=436.0s)]
*  We appreciate the insights this morning from retired CIA officer Mark Palmaropoulos. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=441.0s)]
*  Mark, thank you again. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=445.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpWuBehd3I&t=457.0s)]
