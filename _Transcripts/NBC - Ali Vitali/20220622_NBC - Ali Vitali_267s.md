# Majority Of Voters Say Jan. 6 Impacted Their Worldview: Poll
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [June 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M)
*  Joining us now, White House editor for Politico, our friend Sam Stein. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=0.0s)]
*  Sam, you brought some new polls for us, which we appreciate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=4.28s)]
*  As the January 6th Select Committee hearings continue, 69% say the attack on the U.S. Capitol [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=7.7s)]
*  impacted their worldview. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=14.02s)]
*  Tell us what that means and how significant it might be. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=16.46s)]
*  Well, it's a pretty big number, obviously, for an event that happened about a year and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=18.94s)]
*  a half ago, down a little bit slightly since we tested it a little while ago, but still [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=23.38s)]
*  fairly high. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=28.38s)]
*  I would just caution, though, that if you look at it broken down a little bit more by [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=29.7s)]
*  party, you get a more nuanced sense of what's happening here, which is that at least in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=34.12s)]
*  respect to these hearings, Democrats are paying a lot more attention than Republicans. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=38.739999999999995s)]
*  We tested numbers like how much have you heard? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=43.3s)]
*  Did you hear about the first two hearings? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=46.0s)]
*  The numbers we have here are 58% heard about the hearings, the first two ones, but 56% [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=48.3s)]
*  of Democrats, only 25% of Republicans. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=53.7s)]
*  Now, some of that may be because the first hearing was not carried by Fox News live, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=56.32s)]
*  at least, but you see it across the board with the third hearing, too, where there's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=60.42s)]
*  a partisan breakdown. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=64.44s)]
*  Essentially, what's happening here is that people who are more likely to be moved by [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=65.44s)]
*  these hearings to say that Donald Trump bears responsibility for what happened on January [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=70.16s)]
*  6th are watching the hearings, and people who are less likely to be moved by the hearings [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=74.9s)]
*  are just tuning them out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=78.9s)]
*  In the end, though, of course, the main audience here is—there's two main audiences. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=79.9s)]
*  One is the American public, the other one is Merrick Garland. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=83.66s)]
*  And so, you know, these hearings are for posterity, they're for history. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=86.22s)]
*  They're also to lay out a case that potentially could be brought by the Department of Justice [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=89.1s)]
*  against the former president. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=93.02s)]
*  And we know that the attorney general has said he has watched some of the proceedings, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=95.1s)]
*  although yesterday he was in Ukraine consulting with prosecutors there about potential war [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=98.1s)]
*  crime investigations in the war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=102.38s)]
*  Sam, shifting gears, you've got another poll about inflation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=104.38s)]
*  And with costs soaring, voters were asked to make a difficult choice. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=107.42s)]
*  This question was posed to them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=110.88s)]
*  Would you prefer a recession over inflation? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=112.26s)]
*  Thirty-eight percent say they would. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=114.98s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=116.54s)]
*  That's a tough question. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=117.54s)]
*  That's a tough question. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=118.54s)]
*  I'm not sure about that one. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=119.54s)]
*  But yeah, inflation is just absolutely dominating the political world right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=123.14s)]
*  People are incredibly fearful of it, willing to risk or even invite a recession if it meant [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  bringing down the prices. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=134.18s)]
*  We also tested, for instance, how much people had heard about certain issues. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=136.06s)]
*  And inflation was just dominant. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=139.5s)]
*  Something like 65, 75 percent of people said they had heard or read a lot about inflation. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=140.89999999999998s)]
*  So if there is one prevailing issue that is just taking the oxygen out of the room, it [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=145.98s)]
*  is the cost of goods. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  And if people are willing to say, yeah, I'd have a recession rather than inflation, you [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=152.61999999999998s)]
*  know that this thing is actually a political bogey myth. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=157.42s)]
*  So it is what it is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=160.06s)]
*  And it's clearly just scripting everything for Joe Biden. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=161.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=165.57999999999998s)]
*  And on that, we're going to hear from the president later today proposing a gas tax [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  holiday, even though it may not have support even among his own party in Congress. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=169.94000000000003s)]
*  What's the strategy behind that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=174.22000000000003s)]
*  What sort of where else can they go? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, as you know, they've been searching for things to do to show that they are on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  top of this gas price issue. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=183.58s)]
*  They released a lot of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, did not make that much [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=185.18s)]
*  of a dent in the rise in prices. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=189.38000000000002s)]
*  They've gone with different framing, for instance, Putin price hike doesn't seem to have [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=191.02s)]
*  alleviated concern among the American public. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=195.94000000000003s)]
*  So their toolkits pretty limited. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  One of the things they debated for months is whether or not to do this gas tax holiday. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=200.26s)]
*  It was derided widely as widely as a gimmick by President then President Barack Obama, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=205.26s)]
*  who resisted doing it when prices were going up under his watch. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=211.06s)]
*  Democrats in Congress earlier this year said they don't think it's going to materially [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=214.89999999999998s)]
*  benefit people. It could actually hurt because it will deplete the highway trust fund of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=218.06s)]
*  money. But here we are with the Biden White House saying, OK, we're going to try three [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  months gas tax holiday. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=226.66s)]
*  Hopefully it can give some money to people at the pump, help them with gas prices. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=228.94s)]
*  But like you noted, you need some support in Congress for this thing, and it's not clear [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=233.78s)]
*  that they have enough to get it passed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=237.46s)]
*  Yeah. Politico's Sam Stein, we really appreciate it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=239.5s)]
*  And thanks to all of you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=243.66s)]
*  You're welcome, Sam. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP144sqri-M&t=245.3s)]
