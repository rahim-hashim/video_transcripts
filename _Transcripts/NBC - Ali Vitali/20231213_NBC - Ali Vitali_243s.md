# Seasonal flu activity increasing across the country
**NBC - Ali Vitali:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ)
*  Welcome back. The CDC is reporting that seasonal flu activity is rising across the country, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  with the southeast and south central regions reporting the highest levels. In total, 15 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=6.96s)]
*  states as well as New York City are seeing high or very high levels of respiratory illness. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  This as COVID-19 and flu hospitalizations also appear to be trending up, according to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=18.14s)]
*  CDC data. Joining us now, NBC News medical contributor Dr. Vin Gupta. Dr. Gupta, great [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=25.44s)]
*  to see you this morning. We wanted to have you on to talk about these trends, and we're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=32.2s)]
*  seeing some real rises in these respiratory illnesses. And to be clear, the COVID cases [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=36.24s)]
*  nowhere near as high as other parts of this pandemic, but they're on the upswing as well. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=42.36s)]
*  How concerned are you about this information? Well, Jonathan, as always, thank you for highlighting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=47.74s)]
*  this. Good morning. This is something that all your viewers have to be vigilant about, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=54.16s)]
*  especially as we enter again another part of the travel season for the holiday. So for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=58.16s)]
*  all your viewers out there, must protect yourself. We know that influenza is not peaked even [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=62.8s)]
*  close yet, peaking, we expect, by mid-January. Already, Jonathan, we think about six million [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=68.16s)]
*  Americans have had the flu, 60,000 hospitalizations, 5,000 deaths. I'm talking to you from an ICU [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=73.46s)]
*  in the West Coast. We've seen some of that. Bigger spikes, of course, in the Southeast. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=81.24s)]
*  So this is something that we all need to be vigilant about, especially because vaccine [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=84.72s)]
*  rates are not what they once were pre-pandemic. So there's a lot of vulnerability, especially [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=89.1s)]
*  amongst those that are medically higher risk. So what tips would you give us, Dr. Gupta? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=94.6s)]
*  As you mentioned, the holiday season is upon us. People are traveling or about to travel [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=99.28s)]
*  for Christmas, New Year's, Hanukkah, and the like. What are some tips that people could [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=104.44s)]
*  use to try to stay healthy and stop the spread of these illnesses? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=109.64s)]
*  Well, so I'm going to mention a few things that I think we don't talk enough about. Of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=113.64s)]
*  course, if you're at 30,000 feet in an airplane cabin, I wear a high-quality mask because [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=117.84s)]
*  I want to stay healthy and not be sick on arrival. I highly encourage everybody to do [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=123.6s)]
*  that. If your child's sick and they're in school, keep them at home, have them learn [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=127.96s)]
*  to cough into their elbow. Things like that are obviously common sense at this point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=133.24s)]
*  We know those things. But what are the stuff that we don't talk enough about? If you're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=138.32s)]
*  medically higher risk, 60 years of age, or have a medical condition that puts you at [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  high risk, go to test2treat.org. This is an NIH-funded, government-funded service where [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=146.72s)]
*  Jonathan, if you are an individual across the United States and you're feeling ill, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=155.72s)]
*  you're feeling short of breath, have high fevers in the morning, you can get a telehealth [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=159.72s)]
*  appointment or a same-day appointment in person, get seen. Why is this important? We know that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=163.28s)]
*  if you're somebody that's medically high risk and you have shortness of breath, fever, cough, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  flu-like symptoms, you can't assume that it's just the common cold. You have to get tested [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=172.84s)]
*  because it could be flu, it could be RSV, it could be COVID. Jonathan, as you and I [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=177.96s)]
*  have talked about, early diagnosis can be paired with early treatment, keep you out [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  of an ICU and seeing somebody like me. But if you're high risk, you can't make assumptions [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=186.24s)]
*  about what you have. Go to test2treat.org. It's completely free, government-funded. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=190.98s)]
*  That's one option. For all the moms out there, for kiddos, if you have kiddos eight months [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  of age and younger, talk to a pediatrician about Bayfordus. It's that monoclonal antibody [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  for RSV. It's also something that's new here that could protect your babies from RSV. Have [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=206.26s)]
*  that conversation. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=211.38s)]
*  Really important advice. We're so grateful that he's here to deliver it. NBC News medical [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  contributor Dr. Van Gupta, thank you so much. We'll talk to you again down the road. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbnmzVCJMRQ&t=218.58s)]
