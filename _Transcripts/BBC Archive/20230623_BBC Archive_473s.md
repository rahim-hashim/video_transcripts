# 1961: Aldous Huxley on the power of TECHNOLOGY! | In Conversation | Classic Interviews | BBC Archive
**BBC Archive:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOGFSwrGNc)
*  In your Brave New World Revisited, which was published about two years ago,
*  you did claim that much of what you forecast had come true.
*  I mean, for example, the use of drugs and this instance of people having their thoughts directed
*  while they were asleep through music being played or messages being played through their pillows and so on.
*  In which societies do you think that most of what you forecast has mostly come true?
*  I mean, is it in America, Britain, Russia, China?
*  Well, it seems to me this is not so much...
*  You can't say that it's a question of national peculiarities or even entirely of political peculiarities.
*  I mean, I think when the technological and applied scientific means are developed, they just tend to be used.
*  I mean, I think one can say that the whole history of recent times in relation to science and technology
*  shows that if you plant the seed of applied science or technology, it proceeds to grow
*  and it grows according to the laws of its own being.
*  And the laws of its being are not necessarily the same as the laws of our being.
*  I mean, hence this sense which so many people have and which I think one sees in so many societies,
*  this sense that man is being subjected to his own inventions,
*  that he is now the victim of his own technology and the victim of his own applied science
*  instead of being in control of it.
*  How could he be in control of it?
*  Well, this is the problem. I mean, I think this is perhaps one of the major problems of our time.
*  How do we make use of this thing? I mean, after all, this was stated in the Gospel.
*  Man, the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath.
*  And in the same way, technology was made for man and not man for technology.
*  But unfortunately, the development of recent social and scientific history
*  has created a world in which man seems to be made for technology rather than the other way round.
*  And we have to start thinking about this problem very seriously
*  and seeing how we can reestablish control over our own inventions.
*  Would you say then that America or Britain was as liable to suffer from the
*  arts of mass persuasion or brainwashing, say, as dictatorial societies?
*  Well, at the moment, fortunately, we have in both these countries a considerable
*  constitutional tradition which puts a break on these kind of activities.
*  I mean, for example, one of the ablest writers, it seems to me, on sociological problems is the
*  French writer, Professor Ellul, who views the difference between the totalitarian,
*  the Russian totalitarian and the Western civilizations as being essentially a difference
*  in the readiness to make use of technology immediately and to the limit.
*  I mean, Engels from the first asserted that socialism would come through the use of
*  technology to the limit. And the Russian regime has always been prepared to
*  follow out the logic of technology, whereas in the West, we still remember John Stuart Mill,
*  James Mill, Jefferson and so on. We still remember vaguely the precepts of Christianity.
*  And we are a little reluctant to embark upon technology, to allow technology to take over.
*  In the long run, we generally succumb. I mean, I'm reminded in this context of the line in
*  Baron's Don Juan about this lady who, vowing she would ne'er consent, consented. And in the long
*  run, we generally do consent to. I mean, but in the short run, we thought of a higgle-haggle about
*  it and we are reluctant to, but we tend to be pushed by the advancing technology in a certain
*  direction, which I don't find desirable. And I do think we have to start thinking very intensively
*  about this problem and seeing how we can get control again of our invention. I mean, this is
*  the kind of Frankenstein monster problem. Suppose that this rather frightful prospect comes about.
*  I mean, are people going to be happy under this kind of regime? Well, I think you could. I mean,
*  this was one of the sort of what I may call the messages of Brave New World, that it is possible
*  to make people contented with their servitude. I think this can be done. I think it has been done
*  in the past, but I think it could be done even more effectively now because you can provide them
*  with bread and circuses and you can provide them with endless amounts of distractions and propaganda.
*  It all raises, I think, just to me anyway, this question of how much one really does value
*  freedom or really how free one fears oneself to be. I mean, someone like myself, say,
*  was grown up since the war. I mean, do you believe that I am less free than someone who was
*  brought up in the 20s or in the 80s of the last century or in the 18th century?
*  Well, it depends entirely who you were in the 80s of the last century or the
*  or the 18th century. I mean, if you were a country gentleman with an income,
*  you were remarkably free, but if you were a peasant on his estate, you were remarkably unfree.
*  I mean, it seems to me the, maybe the word freedom perhaps is too vague a term
*  in this sort of context. I think what we have to ask is what sort of a social pattern and what sort
*  of a political regime is best calculated to help the individuals within the society
*  to realize the maximum extent of their desirable potentialities. I mean, it's quite obvious
*  that most of us are functioning at about 10 percent of capacity and that wouldn't it be nice if we
*  could function at 20 percent instead of at 10 percent. Do you have any clear idea of how this
*  could be done? What kind of society it would be? Well, I have ideas. I don't know whether they're
*  valid or not. As a matter of fact, I've just finished a kind of utopian fantasy, which is
*  the opposite of Brave New World, which is about a society in which a serious effort is made to
*  help its members to realize their desirable potentialities. And I've gone into, I mean,
*  this is an attempt to write what may be called a practical utopia. Nothing is easier, of course,
*  than to enunciate ideals and to say, well, wouldn't it be nice if everybody were good and kind and
*  loving, etc., etc. Of course, it would be very nice. But the point is, how do you implement these
*  ideals? How do you fulfill your good social and psychological intentions? And when you come down
*  to this problem, you see it's a very complex problem of organizing family life, organizing
*  education, organizing sexual life, organizing social and economic life. I mean, there are endless
*  factors involved in this. And to try to work out what all these factors should be is, I must say,
*  I found a very interesting job. As far as I was concerned, I don't know whether anybody else will
*  find it interesting.
